Respective Responsibilities of Management and Audtior
These Financial Statements are the responsibilities of the Institute’s Management and have been prepared and presented in accordance with
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial Statements based on my audit.
Basis of Opinion
I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall Financial Statement presentation. I believe that my audit
provides a resonable basis for my opinion, I have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of my konwledge and belief
were necessary for the purpose of my audit.
Opinion
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, proper books of account have been maintained by the Institute with respect to its
activities. F. B. Lander Prize Fund and the Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund, and to the best of my information and according to the
explanations given to me, the Financial Statements which are in agreement with the books of account read together with notes referred to there
in, give true and fair view at the state of affairs of he Institute, the F. B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at
