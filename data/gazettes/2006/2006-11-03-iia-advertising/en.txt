paper used. Write neatly and legibly on both sides of the paper. Leave
a blank  line after the answer to each part of a question. After the
answer to a full question leave one or several blank lines. Do not crowd
in your work.
 (vii)  The left-hand margin of the answer sheet is set apart for you
to enter the number of the question you answer. The right hand margin
is reserved for the examiner’s use and nothing should be written there.

confusion.
 (viii)  You should read carefully the instructions given at the  head
of the question paper, with regard to the compulsory questions and the
manner in which the other questions should be selected. Disregard to
these instructions is often liable to affect you adversely.
 (ix) When Mathematics questions are answered, give all details
of calculations and any roughwork, in their serial order as part of the
working of the problem. Necessary sketches, diagrams and figures should
be accurate and sufficiently large. In an  answer running into serveral
pages if reference must be made to a diagram drawn in an earlier page,
that diagram should be drawn repeatedly.

order you answered the questions. Then using the piece of twine supplied,
tie them up at  the top left hand corner. Do not  tie up at the top right
hand corner.
 (xi) You should personally handover your answer script  to the
Supervisor or to an Invigilator. Or else remain in your seat till it is
collected.  Failure to do so may result in the loss of your script and your
being treated as an absentee for the paper. On no account should your
script be handed over to a peon or an attendant.
 (xii)  If it becomes necessary for you to speak to the Supervisor or
an Invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise
your hand.

Part B
Read the following passage carefully and then answer the
questions set out below :
Most modern political ideals such, for example, as justice, liberty,
constitutional Government, and respect for the law or at least the
definitions of them, began with the reflection of Greek thinkers
upon the institutions of City State. But in the long history of political
thought the meaning of such terms has been variously modified and
always that meaning has to be understood in the light of the
institutions by which the indicates were to be realized and of the
society in which those institutions did their work. The Greek City
states was so different from the political communities in which
modern men live that it requires no small effort of the imagination to

problems, and the ethical apparatus by which political life was
evaluated and criticized varied widely from any that now prevails, In
order to understand at all accurately what their theories meant is
necessary first to realize at least roughly what kind of institutions
they had in view and what citizenship connected, as an effect and as
an ideal, to the public for whom they wrote. For this purpose the
Government of Athens – is especially important, partly because it is
the best known, but chiefly because it was an  object of special
concern to the greatest of Greek  Philosophers.

Syllabus Guidelines
The following notes are designed to give teachers an idea of the
scope of the Ordinary Level French question papers. The notes are
not intended to be comprehensive but they provide guidance on the
linguistic content of the examination.
Knowledge of and ability to use, the structures listed below may
be tested in any language areas within the normal range of the
imaginative or real experience of the average school pupil of 15 or 16.

such areas but they would include the family, school, life in town and
country, transport and travel, shopping, eating and drinking, holidays,
sport, usual professions and occupations.
The language of Ordinary Level, as compared with Advanced
Level, is more straight forward and does not involve very complex
description or complicated intellectual processes. The registers are
narrative with simple description, or conversation ; a very colloquial
flavour, as well as a very literary of technical flavour, is avoided. It
should however, be noted that were no production of French is
required (e.g. in Paper 2) the language may will be more complex and
may contain some lexical items not necessarily actively known by
pupils for whom the examination is intended.
1. Formation and use of all regular and common irregular verbs,
including reflexives, in all simple and compound tenses of the
indicative (excluding the subjective for active use) ;
interrogative, negative and imperative forms ; passive and
avoidance of the passive ; participles, infinitive, common
impersonal verbs ; agreement of participles ; government of
verbs ; inversion.

indefinite, interrogative, possessive, relative and use of memo
in lui-meme etc., en ; position on pronouns ; use of tu and on.

interrogative, negative, possessive, compound, masculine /
feminine and plural forms (of regular and common irregular

6. Adverbs – Form and position, comparative and superlative ;
adverb phrases (e.g. avec plaisir) ; negative expressions.
7. Conjunctions in common use.
8. Prepositions – In common use, including those with verbs

or) ; prepositional phrases (e.g. Au bout de, en train de)

actively. All the items featured may not necessarily appear in any
one examination. The list is not all-inclusive, but is a basic outline,
and any one examination may include other items within the scope
of Ordinary Level candidates.
As the candidates’ comprehension will exceed their productive
skills and they can be expected to understand hitherto unfamiliar
grammatical and lexical items within a context, structures not listed
here, but considered appropriate by the examiners, may also be
included.
The examination does not require a knowledge of specialist or
technical vocabulary or dialect, but of modern everyday language

candidates will hear a narrative or descriptive Spanish
passage which may contain dialogue, of about 200-250

candidates’ understanding of spoken Spanish.
Paper 2 (2 hours)
(a) Translation from Spanish (20 marks) – The candidates
will be required to translate a piece of Spanish prose of

write about 100 words of Spanish.
The intention of this part of the paper is to test the
candidates’ ability to write accurately and relevantly in

subject.
The intention of this part of the paper is to test the
candidates’ capacity to express ideas freely in accurate
Spanish on a given subject using a variety of vocabulary
and idiom.
Syllabus Guidelines :
The following notes are designed to give teachers an idea of the
scope of the Ordinary Level Spanish question papers. The notes
intended to be comprehensive but they provide guidance on the
linguistic content of the examination.
Knowledge of and ability to use, the structures listed below may
be tested in any language area within the normal range of the
imaginative or real experience of the average school pupil of 15 or 16.
It would clearly be impossible to produce a comprehensive list of
such areas but they would include the family, school, life in town and
country, transport and travel, shopping, eating and drinking, holidays,
sport, usual professions and occupations.
The language of Ordinary Level, as compared with Advanced
Level, is more straight forward and does not involve very complex
description or complicated intellectual processes. The registers are
narrative with simple description, or conversation ; a very colloquial
flavour, as well as a very literary of technical flavour, is avoided. It
should however, be noted that were no production of Spanish is
required the language may will be more complex and may contain
some lexical items not necessarily actively known by pupils for
whom the examination is intended.
