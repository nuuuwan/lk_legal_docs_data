candidature for the subject being cancelled.

paper used. Write neatly and legibly on both sides of the paper. Leave
a blank  line after the answer to each part of a question. After the
answer to a full question leave one or several blank lines. Do not crowd
in your work.
 (vii)  The left-hand margin of the answer sheet is set apart for you
to enter the number of the question you answer. The right hand margin
is reserved for the examiner’s use and nothing should be written there.
Number your answers correctly as incorrect numbering leads to
confusion.
 (viii)  You should read carefully the instructions given at the  head
of the question paper, with regard to the compulsory questions and the
manner in which the other questions should be selected. Disregard to
these instructions is often liable to affect you adversely.
 (ix) When Mathematics questions are answered, give all details
of calculations and any roughwork, in their serial order as part of the
working of the problem. Necessary sketches, diagrams and figures should
be accurate and sufficiently large. In an  answer running into serveral
pages if reference must be made to a diagram drawn in an earlier page,
that diagram should be drawn repeatedly.
 (x) At the end of each paper, arrange your answer sheets  in the
order you answered the questions. Then using the piece of twine supplied,
tie them up at  the top left hand corner. Do not  tie up at the top right
hand corner.
 (xi) You should personally handover your answer script  to the
Supervisor or to an Invigilator. Or else remain in your seat till it is
collected.  Failure to do so may result in the loss of your script and your
being treated as an absentee for the paper. On no account should your
script be handed over to a peon or an attendant.
 (xii)  If it becomes necessary for you to speak to the Supervisor or
an Invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise
your hand.

MINISTRY OF VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL
TRAINING
Technical Education Development Project [2197-SRI(SF)]
ADB funded Technical Education Development Project is being
implemented under the Ministry of V ocational and Technical Training
with the objective of supporting the Government’s strategy to close
the gap between supply and demand for technicians and technologists
by (i) strengthening Colleges of Technology (CoTs) to offer technician
education ; (ii) strengthening the Ministry of V ocational and Technical
Training (MV&TT) and relevant institutions to support a market-
responsive Technical Education and V ocational Traning (TEVT)
System ; and (iii) establishing the University of V ocational Technology
(Univotec), which will focus on technical and technological education.
The Project will build on the outputs of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB)-assisted Skills Development Project (SDP), particularly
the National V ocational Qualifications (NVQ) framework.
The Project will strengthen MV & TT and relevant institutions
in order to facilitate, support and ensure quality, efficient and
sustainable TEVT, focusing on NVQ levels 5-7. The Project will
help the Government establish Univotec, to address the shortage of
technologists and qualified instructors for TEVT, and provide an
alternative education and career pathway for students and TEVT
sector personnel, leading to a degree. The Project will, among others,
develop degree programs leading to a Bachelor of Technical Education
(B. Tech. Ed.) and a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) and upgrade
the facilities and equipment of institutions comprising Univotec
offering these programs. Also, upgrading nine existing technical
Colleges to Colleges of Technology, one in each province will be
done. The proposed Colleges of Technology will directly support
