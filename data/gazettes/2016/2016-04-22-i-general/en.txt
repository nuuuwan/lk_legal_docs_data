ThE REPORT Of ThE AuDITOR
TO ThE COuNCIL Of ThE INSTITuTE Of ChARTERED ACCOuNTANTS Of SRI LANkA
Report on the financial Statements
i have audited the accompanying financial statements of the institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, (“the i nstitute”), 
which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2015, and the statement of comprehensive income, statement 
of changes in funds and reserves and, statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information. i have also audited the statements of financial position of f B Lander Prize fund and 
Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize fund as at 31st December 2015. 
management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
the management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i  conducted my audit in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. those standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
in my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the institute, f B Lander Prize fund 
and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize fund as at December 31, 2015, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year 
then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

subsequent surpluses made by APfASL.
1.6 Basis of preparation of financial statements
1.6.1 Statement of compliance
 the financial statements of the institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards issued by the 
institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
 these financial statements comprise the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes 
in funds and reserves, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements.
 the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. these policies have 
been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements unless otherwise stated.
1.6.2 basis of measurement
 the financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost basis, except where appropriate 
disclosures are made with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
1.6.3 Comparative information
 Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of the previous 
period for all amounts reported in the financial statements in order to enhance the understanding of the financial statements of 
the current period and to improve comparability.
 Where necessary, comparative figures have been rearranged to conform to the current year’s presentation.  following items have 
been reclassified during the year;
l Notes 21 &22: An amount of Rs.360,000/- which had been classified under other operating income, has been reclassified 
under reimbursement from Association of Public finance Accountants of Sri Lanka fund.

primary economic environment in which the institute operates.
 All financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise.
1.7 Significant accounting estimates and judgments
 t he preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, requires management 
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments used.

<!-- page 19 -->

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.04.2016
311
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.  
 information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the 
most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows.
a) Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT)
  Considering all factors required under SL fRS 10 “Consolidated financial Statements” for consolidation of financial 
statements, the management determined that there is no requirement for consolidation.  
b) Defined benefit plans
  t he cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. Such method 
involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase, retirement age and going concern of 
the institute. Due to the long term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
c) Contingent liabilities
  Buildings of the institute were situated on 2 blocks of land obtained on lease from the Government of Sri Lanka. Cabinet 
approval has been granted to provide the plots of land where the head office premises of the institute is situated as a free 
grant. Legitimisation of the free grant is subject to settlement of an arrears which has been computed using a different 
basis. the management of the institute is of the opinion that the additional lease rental of Rs.34 mn is not payable as the 
basis on which it had been computed has no merit.
d) Economic useful life of the assets 
  the useful economic value of the asset is determined by the management based on their best estimate and expert advice 
is obtained where it is not practicable to do so. 
  the cost of the building is depreciated over a period of 50 years, considering the cabinet approval granted to provide the 
plots of land where the head office premises of the institute is situated as a free grant.
e) Changes in accounting estimates and judgments
  Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 Assets and the bases of their valuation 
2.1.1 Property, plant and equipment 
a) Recognition and measurement
i) Property, plant and equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the 
asset will flow to the institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All items of property, plant and 
equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently it will be measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any impairment losses. Significant components of an asset are identified and depreciated separately.
b) Cost
  the cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing the 
asset to working condition for its intended use.
  All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
c) Subsequent expenditure
  Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, 
including major inspection and overhaul expenditure, is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if 
the recognition criteria are met.
 
d) Depreciation 
i) Property, plant and equipment 
 Depreciation is calculated by using a straight line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, in order 
to write-off such amounts over the estimated economic life of such assets.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.04.2016
312
 the estimated useful lives of assets are as follows;
  Asset category useful life  
  Buildings 5-50 years  
  furniture  5- 10 years
  Plant and machinery  5-10 years
  Motor vehicles 10 years
  Computers 5 years
 
 Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is 
classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.  
 Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identified and depreciated. 
 Depreciation on property plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds  is charged to the Statement of 
comprehensive income. the correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of the related asset.
ii) Library books 
 Cost of library books are written off on the straight line basis over a period of 3 years.
e) Derecognition
 An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year the asset 
is derecognised.
2.1.2  Capital work-in-progress
 Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses.these are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in 
the construction of property plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-in-progress would be transferred to the 
relevant asset category in property,plant and Equipment, when it is available for use i.e. when it is in the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the institute.
         
2.1.3 Intangible assets
a) Recognition and measurement
 An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the assets will flow to the 
institute and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. 
 intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. following the initial recognition, where 
the cost model is applied, assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
 Cost of development of study materials under new syllabus has been capitalised on the basis that the economic benefits 
would flow to the institute during the effective period of the new syllabus. 
b) Amortisation
 intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there 
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. the amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial reporting year end. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by 
changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriated and treated as accounting estimates. the amortisation expense 
on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, in the expense category 
consistent with the nature of the intangible asset. Amortisation commences when the assets are available for use.
 Intangible assets are amortised on the following bases;
(a) Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight line basis.
(b) Cost of development of study materials is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight line basis from the effective 
date of the new curriculum.
c) Derecognition
 Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the 
assets are derecognised.

313
2.1.4 Inventories
 inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. the cost of inventories is based on weighted 
average cost. the cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and 
condition. 
 the inventories of the institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.           
2.1.5 Impairment of non-financial assets
 the institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. if such indication exists 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the institute makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group 
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, 
using a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. 
 impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories 
consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
 A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets 
recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. if that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased 
to its recoverable amount. the increased amount cannot “exceed” the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation 
increase.
2.1.6 financial assets – Initial Recognition and measurement
 financial assets within the scope of LKAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
in an effective hedge, as appropriate. the institute determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
 All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly 
attributable transaction costs.
 the institute initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets 
(including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which the institute 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
          
 financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and only 
when, the institute has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
 the financial assets of the institute include cash and short term investments, loans and other receivables and trade and other 
receivables. 
(a)  Loans and receivables
 Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
Effective interest Rate (EiR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EiR. the EiR amortisation is included in finance 
income in the statement of comprehensive income. the losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income in finance costs.
 
 initially, loans and receivables are recognised on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets are recognised 
initially on the trade date, which is the date that the organisation becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Loans and receivables are stated at their cost net of an allowance on outstanding amounts to cover the risk of 
non-payment.
 Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, employee loans, deposits, advances, and other receivables.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.04.2016
314
(b)  Held-to-maturity financial assets (HTM)
 Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held-to-maturity 
when the institute has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After initial measurement, held-to-maturity 
investments are measured at amortised cost using the Effective interest Rate (EiR) method, less impairment. the EiR 
amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. the losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in financial costs.
 investments in fixed deposits and government securities have been classified under HtM investments.
(c) Available-for-sale financial assets
 Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not 
classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair 
value and changes therein, other than impairment losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in 
the fair value reserve in funds and reserves. interest income on available-for-sale financial assets is calculated using the 
effective interest rate method (EiR) and is recognised in profit or loss. When an investment is derecognised, the gain or 
loss accumulated in funds and reserves reclassified to profit or loss.
investments in government securities have been classified under Available-for-sale. 
2.1.7 Derecognition of financial assets
 A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised 
when:
 
(a) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired
(b) the institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either 
i) the institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
ii) the institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
 When the institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, 
and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of it, the 
asset is recognized to the extent of the institute’s continuing involvement in it.
 in that case, the institute also recognises an associated liability. the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured 
on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the institute has retained.
 Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original 
carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the institute could be required to repay.
2.1.8  Impairment of financial assets 
 the institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired and if such impairment has occurred, that amount of  impairment is calculated by taking the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flow.
 A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment 
as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset or assets (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss 
event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably 
estimated.
 Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial 
difficulty or default in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or any financial reorganisation, 
and when observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in future cash flows, such as change in arrears or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults. if any indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
 An impairment loss is then recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. impairment 
losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

315
2.1.9 Non-current assets held for sale
 Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through a disposal rather than through continuing use are classified 
as held for sale. immediately before classification as held for sale, these assets are remeasured in accordance with SLfRS 5-‘Non-
current assets held for sale’. thereafter, the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to 
sell. impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised 
in the profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
2.1.10 Cash and cash equivalents 
 t he institute considers cash in hand, amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or 
less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the institute’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements. 
 Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, which 
has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
2.2 Liabilities and Provisions
 Liabilities classified as current liabilities on the statement of financial position are those which fall due for payment on demand 
or within one year from the reporting date. Non-current liabilities are those balances that fall due for payment after one year from 
the reporting date. All known liabilities have been accounted for in preparing these financial statements. 
2.2.1  financial liabilities
 Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption 
value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the loan on an effective interest basis.
 interest-free loans are recorded at fair value on initial recognition, which is the present value of the expected future cash flows, 
discounted using a market related rate. the difference between the cost and the fair value of these loans on initial recognition has 
been recognised immediately as interest income while the corresponding unamortised interest expenditure recognised in statement 
of financial position has been amortised over the period of the loan. 
2.2.2  Provisions
 A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when institute has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be measured reliably. 
for certain operational claims reported as provisions, it is not practical to disclose detailed information on their corresponding 
nature and uncertainties. if the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flow so as 
to reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
2.2.2.1  Employee benefits
(a) Provision for retiring gratuity 
 the institute has adopted the benefit plan as required under the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 for all eligible 
employees. the benefit plan is not externally funded. However, the surplus funds invested by the institute in financial 
instruments are available and adequate to meet such obligations.
 the present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using the 
interest rates of long term government bonds or high quality corporate bonds. Past service costs are recognised immediately 
in expenditure, unless the changes to the defined benefit plans are conditional on the employees remaining in services for a 
specified period of time (the vesting period). in this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period.
 Defined benefit plans estimate the amount of benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on 
one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. 
 the provision for retirement gratuity is determined by a qualified actuary using projected unit credit method. this item is 
stated under Non-Current Liabilities in the Statement of financial Position. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as 
income or expense in other comprehensive income during the financial year in which it arises.

(b) Defined contribution plans 
 A defined contribution plan is a post-employment plan under which an entity pays fixed contribution into a separate 
entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay a further amount. Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as and when they are due.
 Employees’ Provident fund (EPf)
 the institute and employees, contribute 15% and 10% respectively, on the salary of each employee to the approved provident 
fund.
 Employees’ Trust fund (ETf)
 the institute contributes 3% on the salary of each employee to the Employees’  trust fund.
2.2.3 Taxation
a) Income tax 
 the surplus and income of the institute other than surplus and income from dividends or interest is exempt from income 
tax under Section 7(b) (ii) of the inland Revenue Act, No.10 of 2006.
b) Other taxes
 V At has been paid in respect of rent received by the institute, letting of movable or immovable property being the only 
taxable activity carried on by the institute. Since the institute is not engaged in carrying on a trade or a business, the institute 
is not liable to Economic Service Charge or Nation Building tax. therefore, no provision has been made for any other 
taxes.
c) Deferred taxation
 Provision has not been made for deferred tax, as surplus and income of the institute other than income from dividends or 
interest are exempt from income tax under section 7(b) (ii) of the inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.
2.2.4 Translation of foreign currency transactions
