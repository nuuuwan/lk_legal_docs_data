 (ii) Chapter XiX in accordance with the agreements signed by the university,
    10 per cent of the basic salary of the officers who occupied

    Even though a sum of Rs. 180,289 should have been recovered
   from the officers who occupied the official residences from

    university other than the one for which they serve. However, 
   05 lecturers of the faculty of Education had read for a post
    graduate degree at the same faculty, whereas, the studies of
    03 of them had been supervised by the Head of the same
    department.
 ( f) Circular No. 2004/mqia/1 dated 26th January, A board of survey had not been conducted on the library

  dated 27th October, 2007 should be 12 months and a suitable successor should be
   trained during the period of reappointment. Nevertheless,
   a re-appointed retired Deputy Registrar had been 
   continuously employed over a period of more than 7 years,
   and action had not been taken to identify and recruit a
   successor.
 (ii) Circular No. 09/2007 dated 24th August, 2007 Without obtaining recommendations from the treasury
   in connection with the other perks for the permanent
    post, transport facilities from Home to office had been 
   provided  for 2 retired officers who had been reappointed 
   on assignment basis in the year under review. 
   it was observed in audit by examining the conditions on
    appointments that the management had neglected the service
    requirements, alternatives for covering the service
    requirements, and conditions to be laid down relating to the
    security of the institute when the retired academic and                
 non-academic staff were reappointed in the university service.
    As such, it is observed that there is a possibility for the 
   university to face various financial issues.
 (iii) Circular, No. 09/2007 (1) dated  Appointments should be made on the approval of the 
  27th August, 2007 Secretary to the Ministry only when there is a difficulty
    to appoint a successor to a substantive post, and it is not

   Council for a duration ranging from 06 months to 07 years

of the preceding year. increase of Government grants by a sum of Rs.253,026,994 had mainly attributed to the

faculty of Management that results of the first, third, and the fifth semesters had been released after a delay 
of 6-8 months.
 ( c) An attendance register had not been properly maintained as per a specific format enabling to ensure the 
matters such as, granting marks in the range of 10 percent to 25 percent based on the attendance of students,

at the Bank of Ceylon as at 31st December of the year under review. Although the average bank balance

had been taken.
 4.4 Transactions of Contentious Nature :
  the following observations are made.
 ( a) Even though no provisions had been made by the universities Act, and without approval of the Cabinet

completed. Nevertheless, a sum of Rs. 10,211,186 had been paid, but fines on the delay amounting to Rs. 747,195 
had not been charged. A consultant had been appointed to supervise the construction due to its slow progress, and 
an allowance of Rs. 727,000 had been paid to him in the year under review.
 4.6 Identified Losses :
  the following observations are made.
  ( a) A sum of Rs. 54,835 had been paid for surveying and preparation of an engineering plan for the construction of 
a six-storied examination hall that had been included in the Corporate Plan for 2011-2015, but the construction

a facilitate 300 female students, and incurred a sum of Rs. 268,052 in that connection in the years 2005,2006 
and 2010. However, the project had been halted halfway.

responsibility relating to each task in accordance with section 5.1.2 of Circular , No. PED/12 dated 02nd June, 

<!-- page 29 -->

respectively as at 31st December of the year under review, whereas the actual cadre had been 522 and 93
