received for publication in the respective weekly Gazette. All notices received out of times specified below 
will not be published. Such notices will be returned to the sender by post for necessary amendment and 
return if publication is desired in a subsequent issue of the Gazette. It will be in the interest of all concerned 
if those desirous of ensuring the timely publication of notices in the Gazette  make it a point to see that 
sufficient time is allowed for postal  transmission of  notices to the Government Press.
The Government Printer does not accept payments of subscription for the Government Gazette.
