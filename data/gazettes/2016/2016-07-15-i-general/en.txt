Report of the university in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act, appear in this report. this report also to

necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due 
to fraud or error.

  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Standards of Supreme Audit institutions 
(iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
  And audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of

as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the 
finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary power to the Auditor General to determine the scope and the extent

audit opinion.
