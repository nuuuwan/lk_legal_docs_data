In terms of paragraph 4.3 of the Public Finance Circular No. PF/423 dated 26 December, 2006, the financial statements of the
Fund should be presented for audit within two months after the close of the financial year. Nevertheless, the financial
statements for the year under review had been presented for audit only on 28 April, 2008, after a delay of two months.
2:2:2 Accounting Deficiencies
The following accounting deficiencies were observed:
(a) The erroneous debit balances as at the end of the year under review amounted to Rs. 4,439,470 and the net debt balance
amounting to Rs. 4,353,647 after set off of erroneous credit balance of Rs. 85,823 as at that dated had been shown under
the current assets in the balance sheet. These erroneous debit and credit balances included balances amounting to Rs.
2,703,686 and Rs. 85,133 respectively order than 05 years. Out of the erroneous debit balances, Rs. 1,876,872 related
to the Ministry of Education and Higher Education while Rs. 1,114,259 related to the Department of Police. Out of the
erroneous credit balances,. Rs. 25,000 related to the Department of Local Government while Rs. 22,444 related to the
Department of Attorney General.
(b) According to the provisions in the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance, a sum equivalent to 1.5times the compulsory
contribution should be credited to the Fund by the Government as the Government bonus. Even though a sum of
Rs. 10,338,708,699 amounting to 1.5 times the sum of Rs. 6,892,472,466 lying in the Compulsory Contribution
Account as at 31 December 2007 should be in the Government Bonus Account, the balance therein amounted to
Rs. 10,355,436,437. Thus, the Government Bonus Account reflected an excess of Rs. 16,727,738.
(c) The accrued interest amounting to Rs. 2,768,757 which should have been adjusted to 03 Treasury Bonds purchased in
the preceding year, had been set off against the interest for the year under review instead of adjusting to the interest
income for that year thus understating the interest income for the year by that amount.
2:2:3 Non-compliance with laws, Rules, Regulations, etc.
In terms of Section 25 of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance(Cap. 621) the Director General of Pensions should ,
after the close of each financial year, inform the contributors, the balance in the members' accounts as at 31 December,
Nevertheless it had not been done.
2:2:4 Irregular Refund of Contributions
In the absence of detailed Abatement Registers, contributions had been refunded on the basis of certified statements of
recoveries forwarded in their place. The test check carried out during the year under review revealed that such payments
amounting to Rs. 2,912,984 had been made in 25 instances.
3. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW
3:1 Financial Review
3:1:1 Financial Results
According to the financial statements presented, the financial result for the year under review had been a surplus of
Rs. 1,086,976,485 before appropriation to the contributors as compared with the corresponding surplus of Rs. 1,049,305.649
thus indicating an increase of Rs. 37,670,836 in the financial year as compared with the preceding year.

3:1:2 Interest Entitlement of Members :
An analysis of the interest percentage credited to the members during the year under review and the preceding 11 years as
given below:
Year 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007
Interest
Percentage 14 13.25 12.5 12 11.75 11.25 10.75 10.5 10.25 9 8.04. 7.1
According to the above analysis a gradual decrease in the annual percentage of interest paid by the Fund to the members is
observed. A comparison of the year 1996 with the year 2007 indicates that the percentage of interest paid for the year 2007,
as compared with the year 1996 had decreased by 49.28 per cent. The Director General of Pensions informed me that the small
increase in the interest is apportioned among a very large number due to the rapid increase in the contributors and due to the
increase in the number of awards made, the investments had also decreased due to the utilization of funds, thereby resulting
in the decrease of the rate of interest appropriated in the year 2007 as compared with that of the year 2006.
3:1:3 Trends in the Increase of Membership and Investments:
A trend analysis of the values as at 31 December each year in respect of the improvement of the membership and investments for
the nearest 06 years ended 31 December 2007 is given in the following table:
2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007
%% % % % %
Improvement of Memberships 0 0 4.22 14.42 5.08 4.75
Improvement of Investments of the Fund 14.03 32.79 19.54 10.64 9.25 11.32
Even though the pace of the improvement in memberships in the year under review as compared with the preceding year had
decreased the pace of improvement in the investments had increased. The pace of the improvement of the investments in the years
2002 and 2003 had been at a higher rate than in the year under review despite there being no improvement in the memberships.
3:2 Operating Review
3:2:1 Performance
The following observations are made.
(a) The expected targets of the activities of the Fund according to the Action Plan for the year 2007 and the progress thereon had
been as follows:-
Activity Expected Target As at 31 December 2007
Financial Physical
Progress Progress
(i) Registration of Contributors 10,000 - 115%
(ii) Collection of Contributions (Rs. Millions) 700 140% -
(iii) Additional Investment of Money (Rs. Millions) 3,000 50% -
(iv) Payment of Benefits to Contributors (Rs. Millions) 60 73% -
A comparison of the expected targets of the activities of the Action Plan of the Fund for the year under review indicated 15
percent and 40percent favourable variances under two activities and 27 per cent and 50 percent adverse variances under two
activities.
(b) According to the Management Analysis of the Fund included in the financial statements for the year under review presented
to audit, the maintenance of the members' amounts in a manner to make it possible to notify the balances in the members'
accounts as at the end of the year had been one of the 04 primary activities aimed at reaching the objectives of the Fund.
Nevertheless, updated individual accounts had not been maintained in a manner to make it possible to notify the balances of
the individual accounts as at the end of the year under review to the members.

3:2:2 Management Weaknesses :
According to Circular No. 1/97 dated 31 July 1997 and 14/2006 dated 30 October 2006 of the Director General of Pensions,
advices relating to the money credited to the Fund each month should be forwarded by the respective institutions to reach the
Secretary of the Fund before the 15th day of the month following. Nevertheless, such advices in respect of the year 2007 had
been forwarded only by 03 institutions. The courses of action taken by the institution to get those advices had not reached the
expected level.
3:2:3 Budgetary Control :
A comparison of the budgeted amounts in the budget for the year under review with the actual amounts shown in the financial
statements revealed favourable variances ranging from 2.46 percent to 100 percent in 09 items of expenditure and adverse
variances ranging from 17.56 per cent to 100 per cent in 02 items, thus indicating that the budget had not been made use of as
an effective instrument of management control.
4.  SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS
    Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control :-
(a) Obtaining Abatement Registers
(b) Obtaining Contributions
(c) Settlement of Erroneous Debit and Credit Balances
(d) Action on Audit Observations
S. S
WARNAJOTHI,
Auditor General.
OBSERV ATIONS OF THE PSPF MANAGEMENT BOARD ON THE REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL
CONCERNING ACCOUNTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDENT FUND FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31.12.2007.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Rendition of Financial Statements
Agree with observation
2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
(a) Though relevant departments and ministries were frequently informed to settle balances for exceeding past 5 years in
erroneous debits and credits, those institutions had not taken any action to settle this situation. Therefore above mentioned
problematical situation could not have rectified.
(b) Reason to this surplus has been set in as the members have been used to request for awards elapsing long period of time after
nullifying membership and on such times awards are made till the date of nullification of membership, the balance caused to
remain in the account. Investing balance money and crediting the interest benefits therein to the government bonus money has
further been caused to have this surplus.
(c) For the past years accumulated interest for treasury bonds could not settled and after pointed out by the auditing in year 200 6
the same was able to settle in year 2007. Therefore interest settlement for past years could not made and as this has been
rectified by year 2007, this recessive situation may not occur in future and interest for relevant year will be settled accurat ely.
2.2.3 Non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations
It is accepted that the balances should make informed and balances till year 1999 have been informed. As no systematic
information is available, building datum has been difficult while process of computerizing accounts having prepared computer
programs have been initiated. However, 27000 reserve police officers were absorbed into regular serviced the matter of delay
to inform these balances having built datum was arisen as the awards to those officers should have make expeditiously.
2.2.4 Refund of Contributions
All payments are being made based on Abatement Records. As the Abatement Record for year 2007 is received on year 2008,
refunds of year 2007 will be made based on a certified revenue report if contributions have been recovered.

<!-- page 17 -->

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 13.11..2009
Considering the inconveniences of contributors, the Board of Control of the Fund havng met on 24.08.2005 and decided to
grant approval to Secretary and Accountant of the fund to exercise the authority to make payment based on certified revenue
reports certified by the relevant institution which not submitted the Abatement Records for the years before 10 to 15.
3. Financial and Operating Review.
3.1.2 Interest percentage owned for members
The interest percentage appropriated in year 2007 has been lessened comparing the year 1996 as a result of enhancement in
receipt of contributions than the receipt of investment revenue from year 1996 to 2007. Reason for that is the investments of
the fund remained primarily on the re-investment and after realization of invested amounts which invested in higher interest
rate in past years had to re-invest in low percentage rate. Though the recovery of general contributions have been developed,
the amount of 8% debited by the departments in central government by account summary the flow of currency has not
occurred. Under these circumstances limited opportunity being received to thav new investments but only make the re-
investmetns. Therefore slight increase in interest rate and vast increase in contribution amounts has been caused to divide the
slight increase between larger numbers of parties pave the way to decrease the appropriated interest rate in year 2007 with
compare to year 1996. Further, as the amount of awards and using funds has been increased the investmetns have been
decreased. Therefore, as a result of increase in members' contributions than income received the interest has been decreased.
3.1.3 Trend of increase in number of members and investments
Slight increase in investmetns could be observed as receipt of cash impress (12) from the treasury in this  year. However it is
informed that investmetns have not been increased as the amount of awards has been increased. Investments have not increased
comparing to climb in the number of members as the contributions received by account summaries by not occurring cash flow.
3.2 Operation review
3.2.1 Performance
Observations on action plan for year 2007 and actual status mentioned below.
(a) Number of new members for registration was expected as 10000 which increased up to 11669 at the date of 31.12.2007.
Predicted recovery amount was Rs. 700 million though actual recovery was Rs. 987. Though we have expected additional
Rs. 3000 million of investment, the total actual invests was Rs. 1470. Opportunity for additional investments was blocked as
money flowing was not occurred though receipt in contributions had been increased. Therefore the growth of additional
investments was 50% . Due to shortcomings in files to make pay benefits, making refunds for all requests could not fulfulled
during this year. Files received in year 2007 were 324 and those files also added to 656 unfinised files tothe date of 31.12.2007.
Awards for files received in month of December could not make in the same month.
(b) Same as 2.2.3
3.2.2 Management weaknesses
In addition to circular 1/97 action was taken to inform all departments and ministries by circulars 14/2006 dated 30.10.2006
to get received notices of all credits to the Fund which the institutions concerned have not taken action to adhere. Up to date
they maintain a procedure of sending a list alone with cheques or a report. Due to these situations the progress of productive
actions which the fund expected for could not achieved.
3.2.3 Budgetary Control.
It is accepted that an adverse variation could observe when comparing actual information with budget. This adversity was
occurred due to increase in salary, increase in cost of living allowance and allowing for overtimes to complete bulk of warkload.
Action will be taken to consider this matter in future budgetary preparation.
