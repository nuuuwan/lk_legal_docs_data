substantive tests of samples of transactions. The scope and the extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an
audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff, other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out  in
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, methods and practices to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial
statements are free of meterial misstatements. The audit included examination of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in financial statements and assessment of accounting principles and significant estimates and judgments made in the preparation
of financial statements, evaluation of their overall presentation and determining whether accounting policies adopted were
appropriate, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. Sub-sections(3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of

So far as appears from my examination and to the best of my information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of
opinion that the Institute of Medicine Affiliated to the University of Colombo had maintained proper books of account for the
year ended 31 December, 2006 and except for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2
of this report, the financial statements which are in agreement with the said books have been prepared and presented in accordance
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and the stated accounting policies as set out in the notes (from 1 to 14) and schedules (from
A to N) to the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Institute of Medicine Affiliated to the
University of Colombo as at 31 December, 2006 and the financial results of its operation and cash flows for the year then ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Inappropriate Disclosures

Book Allowance advance paid to Postgraduate trainees - Rs. 2.3 million
This relating to Book allowance advances paid to postgraduate trainees who went on PGIM scholarships 4-5 years back. Most
of postgraduate trainees were from the Ministry of Health. PGIM had requested them to submit bills/invoices to certify the

of US dollars 700 initially. To obtain the full amount they have to submit the bills/invoices.
Rs. 44,900 nclaimed Tender Deposits
Comments are noted. Steps will be taken to credit back unclaimed tender deposits of Rs. 44,900 to PGIM Revenue
(b) The buying of Petrol/Telecom/CEB etc. from approved service provides is a Continuous Service without the need for

(a) Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
Translation of the annual reports 2004 and 2005 of the PGIM from English to Sinhala and Tamil languages had been extremely
difficult in view of the medical terms which were mentioned in the English version. In some instances, new words had to be
coined in consultation with eminent scholars when translation was done in the two languages. This was unavoidable in view
of the new words that were used when new sub-specialities came into existence in the Western world. Consequently, lot of
time was consumed for completion of the translation of the Sinhala and Tamil versions. In addition, compilation of the book
and obtaining approval etc., also took considerable amount of time these reports had to be finalized and published amidst all
other office work. However, AG’s instructions are noted for action and every possible efforts would be made to comply with
this requirement, in future.
(b) Financial Regulations - 135
Comments are note PGIM is an institution affiliated to University of Colombo and steps will be taken to revise the Financial
authority limits after obtaining revised limits from the Registrar, University of Colombo.

Comments are noted for compliance in future.
(d) Pub. Enterprises Cir. No. PED/25 dated 29.07.2004
The PGIM has adopted policy of investing funds in fixed deposits in the state banks when funds are lying in the current accounts
but are considered an excessive funds at a given point of time. Interest being accrued from the fixed deposits are used to meet
urgent commitments and to avoid requesting additional allocation from the UGC. The PGIM has always sought necessary
approval from the General Treasury. The funds which had been so generated had been used to meet financial requirements for
activities for which funds had not been indentified in the annual budget. Noted to obtain treasury approval in future to invest
in fixed Deposits.
(e) Pub Enterprises Cir. No. PED/27 dated 27/01/2005
The PGIM consists of four branches of which academic & examination branches are heavily over burdened as 84 examinations
were conducted during the year 2006. In addition, meetings of the core groups were also held. The Academic branch was
instrumental in holding of monthly meetings of the nineteen Boards of study plus the Board of Management and enrolment

etc. This institute possesses only limited resource in terms of staff and facilitied. It is admitted that the draft report should have
been submitted within 60 days. However it was not possible to complete draft annual report within the specified period due
to the routing commitments of the saff officers concerned. Auditor General’s comments are noted for action and every possible
efforts would be made to comply with your instructions, in future.

in service. Out of these drivers, one driver is assigned to the Director other two drivers are working relating to following
examination works.

* Distribution of Answer packets to examiners for marking. Further, one post of driver had not been filled yet. All the vehicles
are released to examinations work when the examinations are held in Galle/Peradeniya.
Therefore, PGIM staff had to hire private three wheeler to attend following urgent and important work.
* To get down stores material to PGIM stores and to bring chemicals Glassware, requested for conduct of exams.

3.1.1 Financial Results
Comments are noted.
3.2.1 Performance
PGIM performance has to be judged against needs (Ministry of Health/Universities/Armed forces & private sector) this is done
by a joint committee of PGIM & Ministry of Health.
In service specialities only 1 or 2 trainees per year is needed. In others trainees don’t pass the selections tests. In yet oth ers,
even of trainees pass, the training places are limited. This is beyond the scope of the PGIM to correct.
This therefore is a matter of supply and demand and cannot be a matter that we can give detailed explanations to Audit.
3.2.2 ( a) The University Provident Fund of the particular employees had not been released. Therefore steps will be taken to recover
the outstanding loans amounts from the employees university provident fund balance. This had been noted in the employees
personal files.

3.2.3 Budgetary Control
(a) Financial allocation letter for the year 2006 received from UGC on 21.12.2005 and the programme budget prepared and
submitted to the Finance & Management Committee and the Board of Management approval obtained. But there was an
administrative delay in Ministry of Higher Education/UGC which is beyong our control.
(b) Action plan for the year 2006 of the PGIM had been prepared and forwarded to Treasury with copy to Superintendent
