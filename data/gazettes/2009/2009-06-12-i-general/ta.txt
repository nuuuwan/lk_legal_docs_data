1:3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transacti ons.

obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the

principles used and significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluati ng
