2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of my information and according to the explanations given to me, I am
of opinion that the Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Affiliated to the University of Colombo
had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31 December 2007 and except for the effects on the financial
statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements have been prepared  in accordan ce
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the State of affairs of the Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular
Biology and Biotechnology Affiliated to the University of Colombo as at 31 December 2007 and the financial results of its operation
and cash flows for the year then ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Transactions not Supported by Adequate Authority
The following observations are made.
(a) A sum of Rs. 5,595 had been paid in the year 2007 as allowances for proficiency in the second and third languages
in accordance with the circulars issued by the University Grants Commission contrary to Circular No. 95 dated
14th June, 1994 of the Department of Public Enterprises. Even though the Director General of Public Enterprises
and the Director General of National Budget had informed the University Grants Commisson that the payment
of those allowances is contrary to the laws and rules of the Government, such payments had been made
continuously.
(b) A sum of Rs. 122,427 had been overpaid to the Universities Provident Fund and the Employees’ Trust Fund due
to the erroneous inclusion of the academic allowance paid to the Academic staff of the University to the salaries
for computation of contribution.
