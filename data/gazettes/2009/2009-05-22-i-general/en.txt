Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Significant Accounting Policies
1.1 Reporting Entity :
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Institute’) which is situated at No. 30A,
Malalasekera Mawatha, Colombo 7 was incorporated by Act, of Parliament, No. 23 of 1959.
1.2 Basis of Preparation :
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS) and are based on
historical costs and do not take into account changing money values, except where stated. Cost is based on the fair values of the
consideration given in exchange for assets. The accounting policies are consistent with those used in  the previous year. The
Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Council on 30th March, 2009.
The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lanka Rupees, which is the functional and presentation currency. Figures and phrases
relating to the previous year have been restated where necessary, to conform to the current year’s presentation.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with SLAS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance, the
result of which forms the basis of making the judgements, Actual results may differ from estimates.

TO  THE  COUNCIL  OF  THE  INSTITUTE  OF  CHARTERED  ACCOUNTANTS  OF  SRI  LANKA
I have examined the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, Balance Sheet of F. B. Lander
Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st December, 2008, and the related Statements of Income, Changes in Funds
and the Cash Flow for the year then ended.
Respective Responsibilities of Management and Auditor
The Management of the Institute is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accor dance with
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevan t to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies, and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Basis of Opinion
My resposibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance w ith Sri
Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the fiancial
statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An a udit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.
I have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of my
audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, the Institute maintained proper accounting records for the year ended Dec ember
31, 2008 and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Institute’s state of affairs, the F. B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E.
Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at December 31, 2008 and their operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri
Lanka Accounting Standards.

with no facilities and not suitable for a hostel and possibility of having earth slips had been selected. Therefore, a sum
of Rs.28,221,230 and been spent on extra works of the construction.
(ii) According to the original plan, it had been estimated to  construct a concrete toilet system and it has been changed to
construct the sewerage system using 27 Bio-cells on a direction given by the Vice-chancellor. However, there was no
proper approval for these changes. When filling soil, after placing the Bio-cells valued at Rs.3,960,000, the cells had been
cracked and therefore these had to be removed and the sewerage system had to be constructed again. Accordingly, the
above payment had become a fruitless expenditure.
(iii) According to the Report No J of the works, the Aluminum Frames used for windows were substandard. Therefore, it
could not be satisfied about the durability of the windows not made up to the specifications, though a sum of
Rs.10,850,918 had been spent.

had been used by the University for over a long period,

be revised. But, without taking action accordingly, annual lease rent of Rs.300 had continued to be recovered since 1982,

recovered even as at 31st December 2007 and had been shown in the financial statement as a balance recoverable,
(e) A sum of Rs.486,312 had been paid to a lecturer for preparation of designs for University buildings even though  Engineering
Services and Consultancy Services Centre had been established under the Faculty of Engineering for providing consultancy
services for the University of Peradeniya. However, due to the defects in the above designs, the designing had been entrusted
again to the State Engineering Corporation and a payment of Rs.345,000 had been paid to the Corporation. Therefore, the
payment of Rs.486,312 made to the lecturer had become fruitless,
(f) Although equipment purchased for projects should be handed over to the University, immediate after the completion of
the projects, equipment to the value of Rs.815,154 purchased for 04 projects of which the research activities had been
completed during the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 had not been handed over to the University even as at 31st  December
2007,
(g) Tenders had been called for, the purchase of beds and cupboards for the new hostel and the recommendation of the Technical
Evaluation Committee also had been obtained for the lowest tender submitted. However, the tender had been awarded to
the highest tenderer without producing valid reasons for rejecting the lowest tender. As a result the University had to suffer
a loss of Rs.5,805,035. Further, the beds supplied by the tender had to be improved by spending the provisions of the
University as the beds were defective and could not be used.
