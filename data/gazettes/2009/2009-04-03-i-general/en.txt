Comments :
Borrowers commenced banking with us in December 1998.
Several facilities were granted to the firm in February 1999. The firm
had incurred losses towards the latter part of 2000 mainly due to their
inability to recover proceeds of credit sales (chicken and related
products) made to restaurants in the area.
Position was further aggravated when supply of chicken products
by Maxies was stopped after expiry of the credit guarantee. Sale of
other grocery items did not yield sufficient revenue to service the
bank facilities.
Therefore. facilities were re-scheduled in October 2000. However
they were unable to repay the agreed installments/interest due on
these facilities.
Their grocery shop was closed down due to heavy losses and a
small business involving repairing and servicing of electric appliances
was thereafter started. This too did not generate an income sufficient
to service the facilities.
Since no settlement is forthcoming it is recommended to proceed
to auction the property  mortgaged to the Bank under Section 4 of
the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of
1990.
Two separate resolutions have been prepared pertaining to
facilities granted to the firm and the partners of the firm to be passed
by the Board of Directors.
The approval of the Board of Directors is sought for the sale of
the property at a public auction in order to recover the outstanding
debts in full together with other charges if any.
The Board is requested to fix an upset price according to Section
11 of the said Act below which, the property shall not be sold to any
person other than to the Bank, to which the property is mortgaged.
Therefore, it is recommended to fix the upset price at Rs.4,000,000-
being the Forced Sale Value.
It will also be necessary to adopt the undernoted resolutions :-
