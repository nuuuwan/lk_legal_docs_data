 SRI   LANKA   INSTITUTE   OF  TAXATION
Independent  Auditor’s  Report  to  the  Members  of  Sri  Lanka  Institute  of  Taxation
1. Report on the Financial Statements :
We have audited the accompanying Financial Statements Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation, which comprise the Statement of financial Position as
at 31st March, 2015 and the statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flow for the year then ended, and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
2. Council’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
The Council is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards applicable for SME’s and for such internal control as Council determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
3. Auditor’s Responsibility :
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the
financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
