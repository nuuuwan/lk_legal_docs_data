My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (lSSAI
1000- 1810), Those Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves perfoming procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures·in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal
control relevant to the University’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the University’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial
statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 or 1971 give discretionary powers to the
Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
