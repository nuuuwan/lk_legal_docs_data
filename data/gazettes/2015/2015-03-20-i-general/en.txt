4,000 per hour and a sum of Rs. 2,840,250 has been paid from January
to September, 2012.
Answer :
Post Graduate Course - Payment for visiting lecturers
MSc Programmes regarding Computer Technology Science has been carried out by other Universities and recognized Private
Institutions as well as our Institution. Demand for this course is determined by the quality of the course. Internal as well as external
lectures have been recruited for teaching activities of the course.
Arrival of Lecturers for the Course is determined by the hourly rate paid to them. Every Institute carried out this course on weekends
and lecturers attract to the Institutions which pay higher fee.
This hourly rate has been determined by including all other basic expenditure for preparation of printed material, printing and
other related tasks into lecture fee paid by us. But other Institution pay for those tasks separately. Such as preparation of printed
lecture notes using LMS.
60% of income which is generated from each of these courses has been expend on course activities and remaining 40%, that is
nearly Rs. 10 million is utilized for activities of internal students, development and improvement activities of the institute, as well
as for research activities. From that there is an excellent opportunity for the government to reduce expenses of the internal graduates.
If it is needed to reduce the hourly rate due to some reason it will be difficult to conduct the course succesfully and it will be an
immense loss to both institute and the government.
