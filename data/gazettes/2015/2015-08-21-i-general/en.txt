AUDITOR  GENERAL’S  DEPARTMENT
The Vice Chancellor,
University of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Colombo for the Year ended 31st
December, 2013 in Terms of Sub Section 108 (1) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 .
THE audit of financial statements of the University of Colombo for the year ended 31st December, 2013 comprising the statement of  Financial
position as at 31st December, 2013 and the statement of financial performance statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement and
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article
154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, No.
38 of 1971 and Sub-section 107 (5) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.My comments and observations which I consider should be published
with the Annual Report of the University in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the Universities Act, appear in this report. A detailed report in
terms of Sub-section 108 (2) of the Universities Act was furnished to the Vice Chancellor of the University on 20th November, 2014.
1:2 Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements  :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Public
Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error.
1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with
Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI 1000-1810). Those
Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to  the
University’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of t he
Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and the extent of the audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
1:4 Basis for Qualified Opinion :
My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. Financial Statements  :
2:1 Qualified  Opinion  :
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements give a true and
fair view of the financial position of the University of Colombo as at 31st December, 2013 and its financial performance and cash flows
for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements

though the sums recoverable from those lecturers due to the breach of agreements should be recovered from their Provident
Funds at earliest, action had not been so taken in terms of Section 94 of Universities Act. Instead, recovery from Provident Funds
had been delayed by defining the shortcomings in the Agreement in a manner unfavourable to the institution;

from a lecturer who vacated the post in the Year 2005.
