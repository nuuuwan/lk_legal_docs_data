PQ) (‘OFL’) with
Bartleet Finance PLC (PB/1079/PQ) (‘BFL’)
THE Board of Directors of Orient Finance PLC (‘OFL’) and Bartleet
Finance PLC (‘BFL’) have resolved to amalgamate OFL with BFL
into one single entity in accordance with the provisions in Part VIII
of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 whereby the amalgamated
entity. i.e. the surviving entity will be Bartleet Finance PLC.
The amalgamation is subject to the shareholders of the two
companies approving the said amalgamation at the Extraordinary
General Meetings of the respective Companies to be held on the
25th day of June 2015 in accordance with the provisions contained
in the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007.
The amalgamation will take effect in a manner whereby OFL
will be amalgamated with BFL and absorbed into BFL and
Shareholder of OFL will be paid in the following manner in lieu of
their shareholding in OFL as at the date of the EGM of OFL.
For every One (01) Ordinary V oting Share held in OFL as at that
date Rs. 14.97 (Rupees Fourteen and Cents Ninety Seven) will be
paid by BFL;Provided however if any shareholder of OFL opts to
have shares in BFL issued to him then 1 (one) Ordinary V oting
shares in BFL will be issued for every 9.075 Ordinary shares held
in OFL.
Such new Ordinary V oting Shares will rank equal and paripassu
in all respects with the existing Ordinary V oting shares of BFL with
full voting rights and the right to participate in any dividend that
may be declared after the date of the issue of such shares and the
right to an equal share in the distribution of the surplus assets of
the Company in the event of liquidation.
In the opinion of the Board of Directors of BFL, the above
payment in lieu of the aforementioned shares in the amalgamated
company to the holders of Ordinary Voting Shares in OFL is fair
and reasonable.
In the event of there being any entitlement of a shareholder of
OFL to a fractional allotment of shares in FBL such fraction shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole number
By the terms of this amalgamation, all the shares in OFL will be
cancelled without payment or any other consideration and BFL
will succeed to all assets and liabilities of OFL. The continuing
Company would be BFL whose shares are not cancelled.

amalgamation becomes effective, satisfy the solvency test.
The Amalgamation Proposal is being placed before the
shareholders of the two Companies for approval and if so approved
