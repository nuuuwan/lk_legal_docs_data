THE  REPORT  OF  THE  AUDITOR
TO THE COUNCIL OF THE INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS OF SRI LANKA
Report on the Financial Statements
I, have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accounts of Sri Lanka, (“the Institute”), which
comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2014, and the statement of comprehensive income, statement of funds
and reserves and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information. I have also audited the statements of financial position of F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E.Begbie Memorial
Prize Fund as at 31st December, 2014.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri
Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility,
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the aud it
to obtain a reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fin ancial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to  the
entity’s preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are ap propriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An a udit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the
Council, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion,the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Institute, F B Lander Prize F und and
Cyril E.Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at December 31, 2014, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then
ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 General accounting policies
The financial statements of the institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (LKASs/
SLFRSs) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies
have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements unless otherwise stated.
Accounting for Association of Public Finance Accountants Sri Lanka (APFASL)
The Institute has accounted for the APFASL as the public sector wing (Division) of the Institute with a restricted fund
equivalent to initial contribution by both parties (Institute of Public Finance,  Development Accountancy (IPFDA) and
the Institute) and subsequent surpluses made by APFASL.
2.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
2.2.2 Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except where appropriate disclosures are made
with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
2.2.3 Comparative information
Comparative information including quantitative , narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of the
previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements in order to enhance the understanding of the
financial statements of the current period and to improve comparability.
Where necessary, comparative figures have been re-arranged to conform to the current year’s presentation.  Following
items have been re-classified during the year;
· Note 3 : Direct income has been re-classified based on the nature of the sources of income, instead of the divisional
approach
· Notes 20-22: Scholarship funds, prize funds, specific funds and grants were re-classified in to designated funds,
restricted funds and endowment funds.
· Notes 20-22: Contributions and allocation of interest income to the funds are re-classified and appropriated in the
statement of Comprehensive Income.
· Note 26: Withholding Tax deductions on interest income previously disclosed under interest income has been re-
classified under income tax on the face of the income statement.
2.2.4 Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements are presented in Sri Lanka Rupees, the institute’s functional and presentation currency, which
is the primary economic environment in which the institute operates.
All financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated
otherwise.
2.2.5 Translation of foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lanka Rupees are converted into Sri Lanka Rupees at rates which approximate
the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets (including securities) and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lanka Rupees at the rate of exchange at that date. Non -
monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated at the foreign
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realized and unrealized exchange differences are reported in the statement
of comprehensive income.
2.2.6 Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with LKASs/SLFRSs, requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows.
(a) Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT)
Considering all factors required under SLFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statement” for consolidation of financial
statements, the management determined that there is no requirement for consolidation.
(b) Defined benefit plans
The cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. Such
method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase, retirement age and going
concern of the Institute. Due to the long term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
(c) Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use (VIU).
(d) Economic useful life of the assets
The useful economic value of the asset is determined by the management based on their best estimate and expert
advice is obtained where it is not practicable to do so.
Buildings of the Institute are situated on 2 blocks of land obtained on lease from the Government of Sri Lanka on a
99 year lease ending on 31st December, 2060 and on a 30 year lease ending on 23rd February, 2037. However the
cost of the building is depreciated over a period of 50 years, as the management is confident that the lease will be
renewed after its expiration.
(e) Changes in accounting estimates and judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial
statements.
2.2.7 Materiality and aggregation
Each material class of similar items is presented separately in the financial statements. Items of a dissimilar nature or
function or are presented separately unless they are immaterial.
2.3 Assets and the bases of their valuation
2.3.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Recognition and measurement
(i) Property, plant and equipment
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and
any impairment losses. Significant components of an asset are identified and depreciated separately. When
significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the entity
derecognises the replaced part, and recognises the new part with its own associated useful life and depreciation.
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Depreciation on property plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the Statement
of comprehensive income.The correspondent grant amount is amortized over the useful life of the related
asset.
(ii) Land  on operating lease
Leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and rewards of an asset under the
leased term are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments (excluding cost of service such as insurance and maintenance) paid in advance under operating
leases are recognized as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of lease on a
straight line basis.
(b) Cost
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable
cost of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, excluding the costs of day to day servicing, less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property,
plant and equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of

<!-- page 13 -->

215I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2015'04'24
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Institute recognizes such parts as
individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly.
(c) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure incurred for the purpose of acquiring, extending or improving assets of a permanent
nature in order to carry on or increase the earning capacity of the assets has been treated as capital expenditure.
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for
separately, including major inspection and overhaul expenditure, is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is
capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the
Institute and its cost can be measured reliably.
(d) Depreciation
i. Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment acquired or purchased through restricted funds is charged to
the statement of comprehensive income on the straight line basis in order to write off the cost of such assets
over their estimated useful lives.
Asset category Useful life
Building 5-50 years
Furniture and equipment 5- 10 years
Plant and machinery 5-10 years
Motor vehicles 10 years
Computers 5 years
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is
classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identified and
depreciated.
ii. Library books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight line basis over a period of 3 years.
(e) Restoration costs
Expenditure incurred on repairs or maintenance of property, plant and equipment in order to restore or maintain
the future economic benefits expected from originally assessed standard of performance is recognized as an
expense when incurred.
(f) De-recognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset calculated as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of comprehensive
income in the year the asset is derecognized.
2.3.2 Work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses.These are expenses of a capital nature directly
incurred in the construction of property plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-in-progress would
be transferred to the relevant asset category in property,plant and Equipment, when it is available for use i.e. when it
is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Institute.
2.3.3 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following the initial recognition,
where the cost model is applied, assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method

<!-- page 14 -->

216 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2015'04'24
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial reporting year end. Changes in the
expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are
accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriated and treated as accounting estimates.
The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of comprehensive
income, in the expense category consistent with the nature of the intangible asset. Amortization commences when the
assets are available for use.
Gains and losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income
when the assets are derecognized.
Cost of development of study materials under new syllabus has been capitalised on the basis that the economic
benefits out of which would flow to the Institute during the effective period of the new syllabus.
Intangible assets are amortised on the following bases;
(a) Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on the straight line method.
(b) Cost of development of study materials are amortised over a period of five years on straight line basis from the
effective date of  the new curriculum
2.3.4 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in
the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is
based on weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them
to their existing location and condition.
The inventories of the Institute include Study Pack and Study Material, Publications,Stationery and consumables.
2.3.5 Impairment of non-financial assets
The institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such
indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required the institute makes an estimate of the
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and
its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash in flows that are largely
independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current
market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to
determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case the carrying
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot “exceed” the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior
years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at re-valued
amount, in which case the reversal is treated a revaluation increase.
2.3.6 Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of LKAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,loans
and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Institute determines the classification of its financial assets at
initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of assets not at fair value through profit or
loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
The Institute initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other
financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade
date at which the Institute becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Institute derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expires, or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset is transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets
that is created or retained by the Institute is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when,
and only when, the Institute has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The financial assets of the Institute include cash and short term investments and trade and other receivables.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss(FVTPL)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial
assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified
as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair
value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance expense in the statement of
comprehensive income.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are classified as current assets, with any resultant gains
or losses recognized in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of listed securities is their quoted bid price at the reporting date. Financial income consists
principally of interest and net realized and unrealized gains on changes in fair value. Interest income is
recognized on an accruals basis, taking into account the effective yield of the asset.
The Institute has not designated any financial asset upon initial recognition at fair value though profit or
loss.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated
by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The
losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs.
Initially, loans and receivables are recognised on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets
are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the organisation becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. Loans and receivables are stated at their cost net of an allowance
on outstanding amounts to cover the risk of non-payment.
Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, employee loans, deposits, advances, and other receivables.
(c) Held-to-maturity investments (HTM)
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as
held-to-maturity when the Institute has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After
initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised costusing the Effective Interest
Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of
comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income in financial costs.
Investments in fixed deposits have been classified under HTM investments.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
(d) Available-for-sale financial investments
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale
or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they
are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses are recognised in other
comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in funds and reserves. Interest income on
available-for-sale debt securities is calculated using the effective interest rate method (EIR) and is recognised
in profit or loss. When an investment is derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in funds and reserves
reclassified to profit or loss.
Investments in government securities have been classified under Available-for-sale.
2.3.7 De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is de-
recognized when:
(a) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired
(b) The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay
the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
either
(i) The Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or the Institute has neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the
asset.
(ii) When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the
asset nor transferred control of it, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Institute’s continuing involvement
in it.
In that case, the Institute also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the
Institute could be required to repay.
2.3.8 Impairment of financial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group
of financial assets is impaired and if such impairment has occurred, that amount of  impairment is calculated by taking
the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flow.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of
impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset or assets (an incurred
“loss event”) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group
of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant
financial difficulty or default in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or any
financial reorganization, and when observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in future cash flows,
such as change in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. If any indication exists, the asset’s
recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is then recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss is reversed if there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the asset’s
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or
amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
2.3.9 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through a disposal rather than through continuing use
are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, these assets are re-measured in
accordance with SLFRS 5-‘Non-current assets held for sale’. Thereafter the assets are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and
subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognized in the profit or loss. Gains are not recognized in excess
of any cumulative impairment loss.
2.3.10 Cash and cash equivalents
Institute considers cash in hand, amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayable on demand and form an integral
part of the Institute’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of
the statement of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash
flows, which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
2.4 Liabilities and Provisions
Liabilities classified as current liabilities on the statement of financial position are those which fall due for payment on
demand or within one year from the reporting date. Non-current liabilities are those balances that fall due for payment
after one year from the reporting date. All known liabilities have been accounted for in preparing these financial statements.
2.4.1 Financial liabilities
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are stated at amortized cost with any difference between cost
and redemption value being recognized in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the loan on an
effective interest basis.
Interest-free loans are recorded at fair value on initial recognition, which is the present value of the expected future
cash flows, discounted using a market-related rate. The difference between the cost and the fair value of these loans
on initial recognition has been recognised immediately as interest income while the corresponding unamortised interest
expenditure recognised in statement of financial position has been amortised over the period of the loan.
2.4.2 Provisions
A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when Institute has a legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the obligation, and the
obligation can be measured reliably. For certain operational claims reported as provisions, it is not practical to
disclose detailed information on their corresponding nature and uncertainties. If the effect is material, provisions are
determinedby discounting the expected future cash flow so as to reflect current market assessments of the time value
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
2.4.2.1 Employee benefits
(a) Provision for retiring gratuity
The Institute has adopted the benefit plan as required under the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983
for all eligible employees. The benefit plan is not externally funded. However the surplus funds invested by
the Institute in financial instruments are available and adequate to meet such obligations.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using the interest rates of long term Government bonds or high quality corporate bonds. Past
service costs are recognized immediately in income, unless the changes to the defined benefit plans are
conditional on the employees remaining in services for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this
case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Defined benefit plans estimate the amount of benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.04.2015
The provision for retirement gratuity is determined by a qualified actuary using projected unit credit
method. This item is stated under Non-Current Liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position. Actuarial
gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in other comprehensive income during the financial
year in which it arises.
(b) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment plan under which an entity pays fixed contribution into
a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay a further amount. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive
income as and when they are due.
Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)
The Institute and employees, contribute 15% and 10% respectively, on the salary of each employee to the
approved provident fund.
Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF)
The Institute contributes 3% on the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.
2.4.3 Taxation
(a) Income tax
The surplus and income of the Institute other than surplus and income from dividends or interest is exempt from
income tax under Section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland Revenue Act, No.10 of 2006.
(b) Other taxes
The Institute being an educational service provider, no provision has been made in respect of other taxes.
(c) Deferred taxation
Provision has not been made for deferred tax, as surplus and income of the Institute other than income from
dividends or interest are exempt from income tax under Section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.
2.5 Accounting for the receipt and utilisation of funds, grants and reserves

are designated for a specific purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives of Institute. Allocations
made by the council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted funds in terms of the relevant Donor Agreements
or with the subsequent approval of the Donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income on a cash basis where there are no terms of references.

(iii) Any other income not specified under above categories is recognised on an accrual basis.
(c) Restricted contributions/revenue
Restricted contributions are provided based on agreements, contracts, or other understanding, where the conditions for
receipt of the funds are linked to a performance, of a service or other process. The Institute earns the contribution
through compliance with the conditions that have been laid down and meeting the envisaged obligations. Revenue is
not recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, until there is reasonable assurance that the contribution will
be received, and the conditions stipulated for its receipt have been complied with.Receipt of the funds does not by
itself provide conclusive evidence that the conditions attached to the contribution have been or will be fulfilled. Until
the conditions have been fulfilled, the contribution is regarded as part of Restricted Funds.
Income realised from restricted funds is recognised in the Statements of Comprehensive Income only when there is
certainty that all of the conditions for receipt of the funds have been complied with and the relevant expenditure that it
is expected to compensate has been incurred and charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
On receiving any restricted contributions, the contribution is credited to the restricted fund account in the Statement of
Financial Position and debited to the bank account. Thereafter, on a systematic basis, an amount equivalent to that
which has been spent on agreed “restricted” activities during the period, is taken to income, by debiting the restricted
fund account in the Statement of Financial Position and crediting restricted Income account. Unutilised funds are
carried forward as such in the Statement of Financial Position.
Any surplus remaining in a restricted fund on conclusion of project or planned activities are transferred as unrestricted
revenue unless it is prohibited by a condition attached to it or the obligation exist to revert back to the fund providers:-
(i) Contributions/ donation for specific projects
A contribution/grant for specific projects is not recognised as an incoming resource, until there is reasonable
assurance that the contribution will be received, and where relevant that the institute has or will comply with the
condition(s) attached to it and those funds are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income up to the
extent that the institute has performed the agreed project.
Funds received as donations without any direct request being made or without any defined terms and conditions
being laid down with regard to utilisation, are unrestricted. In such circumstances the fund are recognized as
income when it is received.
(ii) Government grant
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
attached conditions will be complied with.
Grants that compensate the Institute for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the statement of
comprehensive income in the same period in which the expenses are recognised.
(iii). Funds received for specific purpose
Funds are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income up to the extent that the institute disburse the
scholarship for the agreed purpose.

its statement of comprehensive income.
(a) Project expenses
Expenses in carrying out the projects and other activities of the Institute are recognized in the statement of
comprehensive income during the period in which they are incurred and the basis for identifying project expenses
are mainly on locations of the project, staff allocated to the project and projected activities of the project
according to the project proposal.
Expenses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the basis of direct association between the
cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income.
(b) Operational expense
All expenditure incurred in the running of the Institute and in maintaining the capital assets in a state of
efficiency has been charged against revenue in arriving at the surplus for the year.
Expenditure on examinations, seminars, courses, and other educational and members’ activities are recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income on the accruals basis.
(c) Finance expense
Finance expense is recognized on accrual basis when it is paid or creates liabilities.
2.7 Statement of cash flows
