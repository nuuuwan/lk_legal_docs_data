1. General Policies
1.1 Basis of Preparation
The Financial Statements of Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation comprise the Balance Sheet, Income and Expenditure account and
Accounting Policies and Notes to the Financial Statements. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards laid down by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The financial statements referred to are
based on the historical cost convention.
02. Valuation of Assets and Their Bases of Measurement
2.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or fair value less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment in value.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost.
(a) Depreciation
Provision for depreciation is calculated by using the straight line method on the cost or valuation of all property, plant
and equipment in order to write off such amounts over the estimated useful economic lives of such assets. The estimated
useful lives of assets are as follows:-
Type of Asset Years
Office Equipment 05
Equipment 04
Furniture and Fittings 10
Water Dispensers 03
The useful life and residual value of assets are reviewed and adjusted if required, at the end of each financial year.
2.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short term highly liquid investments, readily convertible
to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
2.3 Short-Term Investments
Treasury bills and other interest bearing securities held for resale in the near future to benefit from short-term market movements
are accounted for at cost plus the relevant proportion of the discounts or premiums.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 15.10.2010
3. Liabilities and Provisions
Liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, the settlement of which is
expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Obligations payable at the demand of the suppliers or within
one year of the balance sheet date are treated as current liabilities in the balance sheet. Liabilities payable after one year from the balance
sheet date are treated as non-current liabilities in the balance sheet.
A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the Institute has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits for which a reliable estimate could be made is required to settle the obligation.
3.1 Retirement Benefit Obligations
Defined Contribution Plan - Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
Employee is eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund contributions in line with respective
statutes and regulations.
4. Income Statement
4.1 Income Recognition

associated costs incurred or to be incurred can be reliably measured.
(a) General Income
1. Enrolment fees from members and students, fees for examination, seminars, courses and other educational activities are
recognized as revenue on receipt basis.
(b) Interest Income on Treasury Bills
Gross interest income is recognized on a cash basis.
(c) Other Income
Other income is recognized on a cash basis.
4.2 Expenditure Recognition
1. All expenditure Incurred in the running of the Institute and in maintaining the capital assets in a state of efficiency has been
charged to revenue in arriving at the surplus for the year.
2. All expenditure incurred in the acquisition, extension or improvement of assets of a permanent nature in order to carry on or
increase the earning capacity of the Institute has been treated as capital expenditure.
5. Comparatives
Where it is necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to the changes in presentation in the current year.
6. Events Occurring After the Balance Sheet Date
All material post balance sheet events have been considered, disclosed and adjusted where appropriate.
7. Taxation
Under Section 7 (b) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, profit and income other than from interest or dividend of the Institute
is exempt from income tax. Interest and dividend which are subject to WHT will not form a part of assessable income.
Accordingly, WHT and notional tax aggregating to Rs. 65,409.01 is the final tax on the interest income of the Institute.
