Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the Public Service Provident Fund for the Year ended 31st December,
2008
The audit of financial statements of the Public Service Provident Fund for the year ended 31st December, 2008 was carried out under my direction
in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (3) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with
Section 24 (1) of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance (Cap 621).
1.2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accountng Principles. This responsibility includes; designing, implementing and maintatining internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1.3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff,
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain reasonable
assuarance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination on a test
basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall presentation.
I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose
of my audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that the Public Service Provident Fund had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st December, 2008 and except
for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Public
Service Provident Fund as at 31st December, 2008 and the financial results of its operations for the year then ended.

the compulsory contribution as at 31st December, 2008 amounting to Rs. 7,838,729,200, that is Rs. 11,758,093,800 should
be credited to the Government Bonus Account. Nevertheless, the balance therein amounted to Rs. 11,803,535,288, thus
overstating the balance of the Government Bonus Account by a sum of Rs. 45,441,488.
(c) Provision for audit fees for the year under review had not been made in the financial statements.
(d) A sum of Rs. 3,384,248 relating to the first 06 months of the year under review had been credited to the Fund by the Ministry

3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Review
3.1.1 Financial Results
According to the Financial Statements presented, the financial results for the year under review had been a surplus of
Rs. 1,404,715,787 before appropriation to the contributors as compared with the corresponding surplus of Rs. 1,086,976,485
for the preceding year, thus indicating an increase of Rs. 317,739,302 in the financial results as compared with the preceding year.
3.1.2 Analytical Financial Review
The increase in the income from interest by Rs. 318,071,949 or 29 percent as compared with the preceding year, had affected
the improvement in the surplus.
3.1.3 Interest Entitlement of Members
An analysis of the interest percentage credited to the members during the year under review and the preceding 12 years is given
below :
Year 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008

Percentage 14 13.25 12.5 12 11.75 11.25 10.75 10.5 10.25 9 8.04 7.1 7.95
According to the above analysis a gradual decrease in the annual percentage of interest paid by the Fund to the members from
the year 1996 to 2007 is observed and indicates a small improvement in the year under review. A comparison of the year 1996 wit h the
year 2008 indicates that the percentage of interest paid for the year 2008, as compared with the 1996 had decreased by 43.2 per  cent.

Even though the pace of the improvement in memberships in the year under review as compared with the preceeding year had decreased,
the pace of improvement in the investments had increased. The pace of the improvement of the investments in the years 2002 and 2003
had been at a highter rate than in the year under review despite there being no improvement in the membership.
3.2 Operating Review :
3.2.1 Performance :
The following observations are made –
(a) The expected targets of the activities of the Fund according to the Action Plan for the year 2008 and the actual position
thereon had been as follows.
Activity Expected As at 31st December, 2008
Target
Actual Percentage
Position
(i) Registration of Contributors 10,000 6,896 69%
(ii) Collection of Contributions 600 1,171 195%

(iii) Additional Investment of 1,500 1,879 125%
Money (Rs. Millions)
(iv) Payment of Benefits to 65 262 402%
Contributors (Rs. Millions)
The targets had been unrealistically stated in the preparation of the Action Plan.
(b) The maintenance of the members account in a manner to make it possible to notify the balance of the members’ accounts
as at the end of the year had been one of the activities aimed at reaching the objectives of the Fund. Nevertheless, updated
individual accounts had not been maintained in a manner to make it possible to notify the balances of the individual accounts
to the members as at the end of the year under review.
3.2.2 Management Weaknesses  :-
The following management in efficiencies were observed.
(a) According to Circulars No. 1/97 dated 31st July, 1997 and 14/2006 dated 30th October, 2006 of the Director General of
Pensions, advices relating to the money credited to the Fund in each month should be forwarded by the respective institutions
to reach the Secretary of the Fund before the 15th day of the month following. Nevertheless, such advices in respect of the
year 2008 had been forwarded only by a few institutions. The courses of action taken by the institution to get those advices
had not reached the expected level.
(b) Audit inspections carried out at the Uva, North Western and the Central Provincial Councils revealed instances where the
Provincial Councils had not taken action to grant the membership of the Public Service Provident Fund in terms of provisions
of the Public  Service Provident Fund Ordinance, No. 18 of 1942 and the Public Service Provident Fund (Amendment) Act,
No. 17 of 2003 to the non-pensionable officers of the Provincial Councils and provide them with the benefits thereof.
4. Systems and Controls  :
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control –
(a) Obtaining Abatement Registers,
(b) Collection of Contributions,
(c) Accounting,
(d) Action on Audit Observations.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 30.07.2010
Observations of the PSPF Managment Board on the Report of the Auditor General concerning Accounts of the Public Service
Provident Fund for the year ending 31.12.2008.
Comments on Financial Statements :
2.2.1 Accounting Deficiencies :–
a) Though relevant departments and ministries were frequently informed by letters and over the phone to settle balances for
exceeding past 5 years in erroneous debits and credits, those institutions had not taken any action to settle those balances.
Therefore above mentioned problematical situation could not rectify. However action was taken to correct most of the
erroneous debits and credits of year 2008 within same year.
b) Reason to this surplus has been occurred since the most members are used to request for making awards by elapse of long
period of time after nullifying of membership and since awards at such times are made till the date of nullification of membership,
the balance caused to remain in the account. Investing balance of money and crediting the interest benefits therein to the
government bonus money also has been further caused to have this surplus.
c) The balance of the allocation account to the date 31.12.2008 is Rs. 486, 926. The estimated value for audit fees for years 2005,
2006, 2007 and 2008 are respectively Rs. 93,236, Rs.99,981, Rs. 110,694 and Rs. 176,250. Accordingly the required allocation
is Rs. 480, 167. An allocation for audit fees during the year 2008 was not made since the total allocation to the date of 31.12.2008
in the account was sufficient to pay above bills.
d) We have not yet received any corrected reports for the letters and reminders dated 03.03.2009 and 22.04.2009 stating values
in abatement reports produced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first 6 months of year 2008 are not tallying with
amounts credited by account summaries. It is informed to submit the reports to auditing after receipt of corrected reports.
2.2.2 Non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations  :–
(a) Section 25 of Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance
It is accepted to inform the balance. Balances till the year 1999 had been informed. Unavailability of proper information has
been difficult to make data base. However at present we have undertaken to computerizing accounts having built-up a computer
program. However, since 27000 reserve police officers have been absorbed into regular service, informing balances by making
datum had been delayed due to the awards to them have to make promptly. Further it is informed that in future the facility
will be available to inform the balance under e-pension project.
(b) Section 10 and 1(3)(a) of Public Service Provident Fund Act
The audit fees bill for year 2004 was forwarded on year 2008 and the due fees were paid accordingly. However the bills for
year 2005, 2006, 2007 were not received by us.
(c) Public Finance Circular No. PF423
Paragraph 04.01 :
We have used Treasury Circular 836 dated 16.08.1977 in order to produce public service provident fund accounts and other actions
till year 2007. However, under the audit report draft of 11.07.2008 it was explained to use Public Finance Circular No.423 for the auditing
in year 2007 and accounts were submitted accordingly. The budget of year 2008 could not forward in terms of the circular instruction and
it was certified by the president of management board. However, the budget estimates for year 2009 was duly forwarded to the Hon. Minister
on 05.11.2008 and the Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs was given approve to it. Therefore the shortcomings such
as these will not happen in future.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 30.07.2010
Paragraph 04.03 (f) :
It is informed that the letter to get verification on balances has not received by us from the Department of Public Accounts and
since the accounts should be forwarded before 28.02.2009, the accuracy of the balance of the public service provident fund to the date of
31.12.2008 was get verified by telephoning Director (Account Service). It will be forwarded to the audit after the receipt of letter to certifying
of balance.
(d) Paragraph 03(1) of the Treasury Circular 01/2008
It was noted to act according to this circular in future.
3. Financial and operating review  :
3.1.3 percentage of interest entitled for members :
The average of collecting contribution from year 1996 to 2008 was increased by 85% but the interest to be discharged was
increased only by 70% comparing thereto. Since the increase of collecting phase of contributory money has been higher to the
increasing phase of interest, the percentage of interest to discharge for members have been decreased.  Though the recovery of
general contributions have been developed, the amount of 8% credited by the departments in central government by account
summary the flow of currency has not occurred. Under these circumstances a limited opportunity is received to have new
investments but the investment of the fund is protected only by making re-investments. Since the money invested under higher
interest rates in past years, the realized money of the investment had to re-invest under low interest rate and the receipt of money
was staged in minimum level reasoned to the decrease of interest revenue of investments. Further, not receipt of cash impress
for government bonus during past years had been affected to the investment opportunities.
3.1.4 Trends in the improvement of membership and investments  :
A slight increase in investments could observe due to receipt of cash imprest by the Treasury for government bonus in this
year. However a broad increase was not observed in investments since the awards had to be made more. Investments have not
increased comparing to climb in the number of members as the contributions received by account summaries but not by occurring
cash flow. Further, the employees in PSPF appointments were confirmed and had to make awards in this year comparing to
year 2002, 2003 causing lack of opportunity to invest.
3.4 Operation review :
 3.2.1 Operations :–
(a) Observations on action plan for year 2007 and actual status mentioned below.
Activity Expected Target Actual Position Progress
Registration of Contributors 10000 6896 68.96%
Collection of Contribution (Rs.ML) 600 1171.28 195.2%
Investment of additional amounts (Rs.ML) 1500 1879.04 125.2%
Payment of benefits to contributors (Rs.ML) 65 261.5 402.3%
Registration of number of members could not meet with the expected target since a large number of applications received at the
end of year. Expected financial targets of activities 2,3,4 were achieved.
(b) Same as 2.2.2(a)
3.2.2 Management weaknesses  :–
(a) In addition to circular 1/97 action was taken to inform all departments and ministries even by circulars 14/2006 dated
30.10.2006 to get receive notices of all credits to the Fund though the institutions concerned have not taken action to adhere.
Up to date they maintain a procedure of sending a list alone with cheques or a report. Due to these situations the progress
of productive actions which the fund expected for could not achieved.
