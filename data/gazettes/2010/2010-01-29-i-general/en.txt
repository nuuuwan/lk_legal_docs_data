TERTIARY  AND  VOCATIONAL  EDUCATION
COMMISSION
List of Accredited Courses conducted by Registered
Training Institutes
NATIONAL V ocational Qualification (NVQ) Framework was
introduced to Sri Lanka in 2004. National V ocational Qualifications
are clearly explained in the National Skills / Competency Standards
and these Standards are made up of one or more competency units.
The training institutions, which are registered and obtained
provisional registration status from the TVEC, are eligible to apply
for accreditation to offer NVQ certificates.
The key objective of introducing accreditation of TVET courses
is to uphold high standard of quality and relevance of the programme
conducted by registered training institutions in Sri Lanka.
Accreditation is considered as a quality assurance measure and
a useful management tool for continuous improvement of a training
course or training institution. Therefore, it is considered to be one
of the primary methods for maintaining and improving standards of
education and training. Accreditation is a process whereby a
professional organization or a government agency grants recognition
to an educational institution for demonstrated ability in a special
area of practice or training. Each course seeking accreditation is
evaluated in relation to competency unit specified in the National
Skills / Competency Standards.
Assessment for accreditation is done by panel of assessors
comprised of a trade expert and a representative of the TVEC.
Accreditation certificates are awarded to the institutions when the
panel of assessors recommended to course for accreditation and
after the Commission approval is obtained.
The Technical and V ocational Training courses conducted in
public, private and non governmental training institute which are
accredited by the Tertiary and- V ocational Education Commission
are listed below.
