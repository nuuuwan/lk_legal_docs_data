3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Results
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the University for the year under review had resulted in a deficit of
Rs. 580,080,260 before taking into account the Government grant for recurrent expenditure as compared with the corresponding
deficit of Rs. 569,834,728 for the preceding year. After taking into account the Government grant of Rs. 579,853,000 received for
recurrent expenditure, the deficit for the year under review had been reduced to Rs. 227,260 and the Government grant of Rs.
503,400,000 received for recurrent expenditure for the preceding year had reduced the deficit of that year to Rs. 66,434,728.

The specific  funds granted had not been utilized for the purposes for which they were granted and interest aggregating Rs. 2,323,453
had been transferred to fixed deposit without proper authority.
3:3 Uneconomic Transactions
Following observations are made :

telephone lines had been utilized for internal communication in the University instead of using the internal communication system.

if the Intercom system was in operation in its full capacity.
(b) Grass cutting charges amounting to Rs. 76,640 had been paid in respect of External Examination unit. This Job could have been

at Medical faculty. However, constrcution works had not yet been completed. Further, due to undue delay the cost of
construction had to be increased tremendously and the objective of this building also had not been achieved. In addition, a sum

works, which had not yet been commenced.

3:8 Appointment of the Academic Staff
Following observations are made :
(a) Appointments to the permanent posts of lecturers had been made separetely to each Faculty of the University as a general rule
resulting in engaging several lecturers in the same field of study. In preparing time tables for various Faculties, the availability of
the services of permanent lecturers in other Faculties had not been considered. Whenever the service of lecturers in the
permanent staff were required for another Faculty, separate letters of appointment had been issued to them as visiting lecturers
and additional lecture fees had been paid for such services.
(b) In several instances, temporary lecturers, tutors, demonstrators etc. had been appointed on the request made by the Heads of
Department without following proper recruitment procedure.
(c)  It was the regular feature of the University that the filling of vacant posts of academic staff is in an improper manner, without
giving an opportunity to complete those who have qualifications and expect employment in the University system. Although
this had been pointed out in my reports for the last several years, no action had been taken to rectify this deficiency.
3:9 Courses Conducted and Examinations Held
Following observations are made :
(a) Total number of students registered in 10 courses of the University were 5116. Total recurrent expenditure incurred during the

results of the examinations had not been determined. It was further observed that there were considerable delays in releasing the
results of examinations conducted by certain Faculties during the years 2006 and 2007. According to the University Grants
Commission Circular No. 636 of 14th July, 1995 results should be released within three months after the examination held. But,
release of results had been delayed by periods ranging from 6 to 12 months.
(c) Details regarding the total number of students who appeared for the examinations held during the year under review had not been
furnished to audit.
3:10 Granting Leave with Pay and No Pay for Postgraduate Studies
Following observations are made :
(a) Study leave had been approved for more than one year to the lecturers who had gone abroad for studies without taking into
consideration the instructions mentioned in Section 27.4 of Chapter 10 of the Establishments Code for the University Grants
Commission and the Higher Educaional Institutions.
(b) Instances were observed in approving study leave to lecturers under probationary period before completing one year service.
3:11 Budgerary Control
Significant variations were observed between the budget and the actuals of income and expenditure thus indicating that the budget had
not been made use of as an effective instrument of management control.
4. Systems and Controls
Deficinecies observed during the course of audit were brought to the notice of the Vice Chancellor of the University by my detailed report
issued in terms of Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance Act. Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control.

f) This work was awarded to the Dept. of Buildings (Province) by the University Council in the year 2004. The work had not
been completed so far. The delay may be due to the termination of contract between the Dept. of Buildings and the
contractor in 2006 and prevailing situation at Vavuniya especially in Pampaimadu.
3:8 a) The permanent teaching staff are involved in Faculty as well as interfaculty teaching without any additional remuneration
other than their salary. When the teaching load of a teacher in his/her Departments/Faculty is far in excess of the approved
academic norms of a particular academic position, payment is made by appointing them as visiting lecturers for the lectures
they take out side their academic norms in departments out side the faculty to which they belong to. Only a small number
of such visiting appointments are made under inevitable circumstances.
Cadres are determined by the University Grants Commission based on the needs of each Faculty. Further although the title
of the “Field of Study” may look alike, the scope of the course and the courses contents could be very different. For
example the way Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is taught in a Science Faculty is different from how it is taught in
an Engineering Faculty.
b) The temporary posts in Assistant Lecturer, Tutor, Demonstrator and instructors are regularly advertised before the
commencement of every academic year and recruitment is made by following the proper recruitment procedure.
