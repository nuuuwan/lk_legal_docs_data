Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Peradeniya for the year ended 31st December,
2008 in terms of Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Section 13 (7) ( a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971
The audit of financial statements of the University of Peradeniya for the year ended 31st December, 2008 was carried out under my direction
in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunc tion with
Section 108 (2) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38
of 1971. My comments and observations which I consider should be published with the Annual Report of the University in terms of Section
108 (2) of the Universities Act and Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 appear in this report.
1.2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements.
Management is resposible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes, designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1.3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 29.10.2010
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain
reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination
on test basis of evidence supportiong the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessments of accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall
presentation. I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary
for the purpose of my audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides and reasonable basis for my opinion. Sub-sections (3) and (4)
of section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give descretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent
of the Audit.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Opinion
In view of my comments and observations appearing in this report, I am unable to express an opinion on the financial statements of
the University of Peradeniya for the year ended 31st December, 2008 presented for audit.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2.2.1 Sri Lanka Accounting Standards :
The following observations are made –
(a) The written down value of fixed assets costing Rs. 770,608,883 as at 31st December, 2008 had become zero. But, they
continued to be used and action had not been taken to revalue the assets and to take the value into accounts in terms of Standard
No. 18. The Vice-Chancellor had informed that the basic work regarding revaluation has already been started.
(b) Fixed assets to the value of Rs. 20,500,000 had been purchased from the Treasury Grants as at 31st December, 2008 and the
annual depreciation there of had been written-off against the operating results. Nevertheless, the net value of the Treasury
Grants as at that date had not been shown in the financial statements in terms of Standard No. 24. Further, the policy of the
institute on accounting for Treasury Grants had not been disclosed with the financial statements.
(c) The contingent liabilities with regard to 08 court cases filed against the University had not been estimated and included in the
Note on contingent liabilities submitted with the financial statements in terms of Standard No. 36 and the contingent liabilites
amounting to Rs. 2,940,000 relating to 13 court cases finalized had been included in that Note of contingent liabilities.
2.2.2 Accounting Policies :
Although it had been stated in the financial statements for the year under review that the financial statements were prepared on
accrual basis, the following income and expenditure has not been brought to account on accrual basis.
(i) Rates amounting to Rs. 1,347,281 payable in respect of the years 1995 to 2007 had not been brought to account, whilst the
rates payable for the year under review had not been computed and brought to account.
(ii) Hostel charges, library fees and the fines thereon amounting to Rs. 1,448,457 due from the students from year 2006 to 2008
in respect of holidays had not been brought to account.
2.2.3 Accounting Deficiencies :
The following matters were observed.
(a) Omissions in the Accounts :
(i) A bank acocunt has been maintained in the People’s Bank since 2002 for accounting the income and expenditure of the Arts
Council of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Peradeniya. However the transactions had not been brought to account
from the inception and the balance of this account as at 31st December, 2008 amounted to Rs. 3,336,671.
(ii) A sum of Rs. 606,776 deducted from the salaries of graduate teachers for the Mahapola Scholarships and bursaries and
remitted, had been credited to the Vic-Chancellors Fund, instead of crediting to Mahapola Scholarships and Bursaries
Funds. Further, provision had not been made in the accounts for scholarship aid receivable for the year under review
amounting to Rs. 1,637,850.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 29.10.2010
(b) Overstatements and Understatements in the Accounts
(i) Mahapola and Bursaries amounting to Rs. 2,716,600 paid during the year under review in respect of the preceding year had
been brought to account as expenditure of the year, instead of being adjusted to the Accumulated Fund and provisions had
not been made in the accounts for sum of Rs. 971,500 payable for the year under review.
(ii) The value of 141 items of stocks existed according to the Stocks Verification Reports of the Dental Faculty for the year
2008 has not been computed and brought to account.
(c) Inappropriate Disclosures in the Accounts.
(i) The difference of Rs. 18,102,977 between the stock book balances and the physical balances existed since the year 1995 had
been brought to account under sundry creditors as stock adjustments instead of identifying the difference and settle the
same.
