The vice Chancellor,
University of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Colombo for the year ended 31 December 2009
in terms of section 108(2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and section 13(7)(a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971
THE Audit of financial statements of the University of Colombo for the year ended 31st December, 2009 was carried out under my direction
in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with
sections 108(1) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of  1978 and Sub- sections (3), (4) and (7) of section 13 of the Financ e Act, No.
38 of 1971. This report is issued in terms of Section 108(2) of the Universities Act and section 13(7) ( a)  of the Finance Act, No. 38 of
1971. My comments and observations on the above financial statements appear in this report.
1:2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the prepartion and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes : designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that arefree from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or err or,
selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies, and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1:3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions.
The scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations
of staff, other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards t o
obtain reasonable assurance as to whethre the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the
examination on a test basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting
principles used and  significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluating
their overall presentation. I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belie f
were necessary for the purpose of my audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. Sub-
sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine
the scope and extent of the Audit.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Opinion :
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that the University of Colombo had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st December, 2009 and except for
the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial  statements have been
prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the State of Affairs of the University
