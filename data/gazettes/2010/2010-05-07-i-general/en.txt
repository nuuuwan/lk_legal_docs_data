Report of the Auditor
To the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka
I have examined the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka as at 31st December, 2009, the
Balance Sheets of F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund and the related Statements of Income, Changes in Funds
and the Cash Flow for the year then ended.
Respective Responsibilities of Management and Auditor
These Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Institute’s Management and have been prepared and presented in accordance
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial Statements based on my audit.
Basis of Opinion
I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I plan and perform the audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes exmining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. An audit also includes assessing the accoun ting
principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall Financial Statement presentation. I believe
that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. I have obtained all the information and explanations which to the bes t of my
knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of my audit.
Opinion
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, proper books of account have been maintained by the Institute with respect to
its activities, F B Lander Prize Fund and the Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund, and to the best of my information and according to the
explanations given to me, the Financial Statements which are in agreement with the books of account read together with the notes referred
to therein, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Institute, the F. B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund
