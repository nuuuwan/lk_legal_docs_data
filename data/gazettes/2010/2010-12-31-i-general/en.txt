THE audit of financial statements of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December, 2006 was carried out under
my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lank a read in
conjunction with Sections 108 (1) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13 of the Finance

(7) (a) of the Finance Act was furnished to the Vice Chancellor of the University on 24th August, 2007.
1:2 Scope of Audit :
Audit opinion, comments and findings in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive
tests of samples of transactions. The scope and the extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage
as possible within the limitations of staff, other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri
Lanka Auditing Standards, Methods and Practices to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatements.  The audit included examination of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and assessment of accounting principles and significant estimates and judgements made in the preparation of financial statements,
evaluation of their overall presentation and determining whether the accounting policies adopted were appropriate, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the
Auditor General  to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion :
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of my information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion

except for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in Paragraph 2.2 of this report the financial statements which
are in agreement with the said books have been prepared and presented in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and
the stated accounting policies and notes (No. 1 to 10) to the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of
the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka as at 31st December, 2006 and the financial results of its operation and cash flows for the
year then ended.

3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Performance
3.1.1 Financial Results
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the University for the year ended 31st December, 2006 had
resulted in a deficit of Rs. 259,906,871 before taking into account the Government grant for recurrent expenditure as compared
with the corresponding deficit of Rs. 190,571,444 for the preceding year. After taking into account the Government grant
amounting to Rs. 203,540,590 for recurrent expenditure, the deficit for the year under review was reduced to Rs. 56,366,281
and likewise the Government grant amounting to Rs. 163,537,502 received for recurrent expenditure during the preceding year
had reduced the deficit of that year to Rs. 27,033,942.
3.1.2 Utilization of Research Grants
The following matters were observed at an audit test checks of the activities carried out by the University utilizing the research
grants.
(a) Files relating to each research grant project had been maintained. But, most of the agreement forms had not been signed by the
Vice-Chancellor/Registrar and certain applications had not been signed by the Secretary of the Research Grant Committee.
(b) Obtaining extension of time was a common feature without furnishing research reports within the period approved by the
Research Committee. A sum of Rs. 176,170 had been paid in respect of incomplete research activities while there were instances
of delay in projects for a period of 4 years beyond the due date. In this regard, the Vice Chancellor stated that all these grants
had been settled.
(c) Research and Publication Committee had taken a decision in the meeting (RPC No. 11/2006) held on 06th July, 2006 to give
final extensin to settle the outstanding research grant advance upto 27th August, 2006 and if failed to settle this outstanding
advance, action would be taken to recover the research grant in full from their salary in equal installments from 25th September,
2006 from the respective teachers who obtained the research grant. However, this decision had not been implemented up to
the date of audit inspection on 30th March, 2007.
3.1.3 Uneconomic Transactions
Following observations are made :
(a) Expenditure totalling Rs. 836,100 had been incurred for upgrading 17 computers at an average cost of Rs. 49,000 per
computer. However, it appears that new computers could have been purchased within the amount spent. Further, this
expenditure had not been capitalized.
(b) A sum of Rs. 265,783 had been spent as lawyers’ fees for instituting legal action against third parties, instead of handing over
the cases to the Attorney General’s Department.
3.1.4 Improper Utilization of Funds
Following observations are made :
(a) A cheque for Rs. 7,500,000 drawn in favour of the Buildings Department and accounted under fixed assets had been remitted
to the Buildings Department during the year under review with a delay of 9 months. However, the cheque had been returned
by the Department subsequently. Therefore, the fund for capital expenditure had remained unutilized during the year under
review. Further, this amount had been transferred from capital fund account to recurrent fund account. In this respect the Vice
Chancellor had stated that the work had been awarded to other contractors.
(b) A sum of Rs. 602,803 had been spent on construction of a building out of the University Fund instead of IRQUE fund. The
building was intended to be utilized for the IRQUE project.

reasons. However, these works have been awarded to other contractors subsequently by calling public tenders and are in
progress. (Pl see Annex 02)

Books valued at Rs. 2,082,934 purchased during the year under review had not been handed over to the Library for the use of
students but kept in the respective Faculties and Departments without any use.
3.2:6 Irregularities in Granting and Settlement of Advances
(a) A sum of Rs. 486,000 obtained by the staff of the University as advances had been refunded without utilizing the money after
a delay ranging from 3-12 months, which might lead to temporary misappropriation of cash.
(b) A sum of Rs. 1,690,877 obtained by the staff during the year under review and the previous year had remained unsettled as at
31st December, 2007.
3.2.7 Utilization of V ehicles
The University had 10 vehicles in its fleet. The following observations are made in this regard :-
(a) According to the daily running charts of 10 vehicles of the University, the vehicles had performed  231,275 Km. during the year
under review and consumed 22,511 litres of fuel. However, according to the certificate of fuel consumption of each vehicle
given by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), the vehicles should have consumed Rs. 16,918 litres. Therefore, an excess
consumption of Rs. 5,593 litres costing approximately Rs. 434,273 had been observed.
(b) Bills had been attached to the payment vouchers for the consumption of fuel in excess of the tank capacity of the vehicles
which is not possible.
(c) Although the University had 10 vehicles in its fleet, additional vehicles had been hired from private parties and hire charges
amounting to Rs. 2,931,491 had been paid during the year under review. Economy had not been exercised in the utilization of
vehicles. Trips had not been organized to transport the officers in groups. Instead, individual officers had travelled in single
trips. In this connection, the Vice Chancellor stated that only 4 vehicles available for long distance travels and therefore, private
vehicles were hired.
3.2.8 Procurement of Library Security System
Payments totalling Rs. 7,302,500 had been made during the year under review to purchase security system to the Library. In this
regard, the following deficiencies were observed :-
(a) Specifications had not been determined prior to calling for tender. Instead the decision had been made based on the specifications
given by the tenderer.
(b) Decision for the procurements totalling Rs. 7,350,000 had been made based on only one tender.
(c) According to the contract agreement the installation of this system should have been completed before 07th January, 2007.
However it had not been completed even as at 30th June, 2008. Liquidated damages had not been recovered.
(d) A bar code system for the Library had been purchased during the year 2005/2006 for the same purpose for Rs. 1,192,980.
However, this system had been abandoned without any use. Therefore, the total expenditure incurred had become fruitless.
In this connection the Vice Chancellor stated that the Library security system was procured under public tender and the tender
documents consisted all the requirements including specifications. Therefore, the tenders received were processed. Since the
value of the tender is less than Rs. 20M, this was handled by the University Tender Board.
