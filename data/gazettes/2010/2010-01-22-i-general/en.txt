Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of the S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation which
cpmprise the balance sheet as at 31st December, 2008, and the income statement and Cash Flow statement for the year then ended and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management’ s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsiblility includes: designing, implementing and maintaning internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting an d applying
appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statemens based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a  test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the
purposes of our audit. We therefore believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, so far as appears from our examination, the Foundation maintained proper accounting records for the year ended
December 31, 2008 and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Foundation’s state of affairs as at December, 31, 2008 and
