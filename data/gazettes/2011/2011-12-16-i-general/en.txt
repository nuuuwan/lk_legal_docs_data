summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management’ s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance

An audit includes examining, on a  test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit

financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the
