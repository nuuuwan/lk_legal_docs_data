The audit of financial statements of the Public Service Provident Fund for the year ended 31st December, 2009 was carried out

in conjunction with Section 24 (1) of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance (Chapter 621).

1.2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. This responsibility includes; designing, implementing and maintatining internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1.3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff,
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain reasonable
assuarance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination on a test
basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall presentation.
I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose
of my audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that the Public Service Provident Fund had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st December, 2009 and except
for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Public
Service Provident Fund as at 31st December, 2009 and the financial results of its operations for the year then ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2.2.1 Accounting Deficiencies -
The following accounting deficiencies were observed :-
(a) The erroneous debit balances as at the end of the year under review amounted to Rs. 6,069,020 and the net debit balance
amounting to Rs. 5,983,197 after the set off of erroneous credit balance of Rs. 85,823 as at that date had been shown under
the current assets in the balance sheet. These erroneous debit and credit balances included balances amounting to Rs. 2,779,140
and Rs. 85,823 respectively older than 05 years. Out of the erroneous debit balances, balances amounting to Rs. 1,590,590,
Rs. 531,508, Rs. 205,859 and Rs. 166,608 related to the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the Department of
Police, the Department of Telecommunication and the Ministry of Transport and Highways respectively, while credit
balances amounting to Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 22,443 related to the Department of Local Government and the Department of
Attorney General respectively.
(b) According to the provisions in the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance, a sum equivalent to 1.5 times the balance of
the compulsory contribution should be credited to the Fund as the Governement Bonus.l Therefore 1.5 times the compulsory
contribution of Rs. 9,236,864,908 as at 31st December, 2008 amounting to Rs. 13,855,297,362 should be with the Fund.
Nevertheless, the balance therein amounted to Rs. 13,976,345,711 thus overstating the balance of the Government Bonus
Account by a sum of Rs. 121,048,349.
2.2.2 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations :
Instances of non-compliance with the following laws, rules, regulations, etc. were observed :-
Reference to Laws, Rules  and Non-compliance
Regulations
(a) Section 25 of the Public Service Provident Fund According to the Section referred to, the Director of Pensions should,
Ordinance (Cap. 621) after 31st December, of each year, inform the contributors the balances
lying to the credit of their accounts. Nevertheless, the Director General
of Pensions had not taken action in that connection in the year under
review. The Director General informed that this could be done shortly
through the E-Pensions Project.

The increase in the income from interest by Rs. 987,726,465 or 70 percent as compared with the preceding year, had affected
the improvement in the surplus.
3.3 Interest Entitlement of Members :
An analysis of the interest percentage credited to the members during the year under review and the preceding 13 years are given
below :
Year 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009

According to the above analysis a gradual decrease in the annual percentage of interest paid by the Fund to the members from
the year 1996 to 2007 is observed and indicates an improvement from year 2008. A comparison of the year 1996 with the year 2009 indicates
that the percentage of interest paid for the year 2009, as compared with the year 1996 had decreased by 15.35 percent.
3.4 Trends in the Improvement of Membership and Investments  :

2009 and the trend analysis as at 31st December of each year are given in the following statement:

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 18.11.2011
Even though the pace of the improvement in memberships in the year under review as compared with the preceeding year had decreased,
with an increase with the pace of improvement in the investments. The pace of the improvement of the investments in the years 2002 and
2003 had been at a higher rate than in the year under review despite there being no improvement in the membership.
3.5 Interest Income deprived of to the Fund :
The Government bonus receivable from the Secretary to the Treasury had not been received by the Fund and as such the interest
income that could have been earned by the investment of such money had been deprived of to the Fund. Such interest income deprived
of during the year under review and the 05 preceding years (approximately) is as follows.
Year Amount receivable Potential Profit on Profit deprived of as
from the Treasury as  Investment in a Percentage of Profit
at 31st December Treasury Bonds for the year of
Accounts
Rs. Rs.
2004 90,490,948 13,754,624 1.4
2005 583,873,124 88,748,714 9.2
2006 1,013,381,581 154,034,000 14.6
2007 1,451,131,498 206,060,673 18.8
2008 1,799,238,475 307,669,779 21.8
2009 1,792,715,215 277,870,858 11.6
Even though action had been taken for the Treasury to cause the remittance of the above amounts the efforts had not been successful.
Consequently the profit of the Fund had decreased resulting in the decrease in the interest payable to the members.
3.6 Staff  Utilization :
The membership of the Fund by the year under review indicated an improvement of 34.6 percent as compared with the year 2003.
Nevertheless, there was no change whatoever in the number of officers for the operation of the activities of the Fund and as such
it was observed that the ratio of members per officer had escalated. The positions for the year under review and the 06 preceding
years had been as follows:
Year Number of Members Cadre Number of Members
per Employee
2003 166,000 27 6,148
2004 173,000 27 6,407
2005 197,951 27 7,332
2006 208,012 27 7,704
2007 217,905 27 8,070
2008 221,512 27 8,204
2009 232,779 27 8,621
A delay prevailing in the regular functions of the Fund due to the increase in the ratio of members to employee was observed.
3.7 Payment of Benefits to Members :
Payments in respect of 1957 applications out of the applications received from the Members for benefits in the year 2009 had
not been made by 31st December, 2009 and that represented 31.8 percent of the total number. The position for the year under
review and the 05 preceding years is given below:

3.8 Operating Performance :
The following observations are made.
(a) The expected targets of the activities of the Fund according to the Action Plan for the year 2009 and the actual position are
as follows:
Activity Expected As at 31st December, 2009
Target Actual Percentage
(i) Registration of Contributors 6,600 15,461 257%
(ii) Collection of Contributions (Rs. M) 800 1,731 216%
(iii) Additional Investment of money (Rs. M) 2,200 3,328 147%
(iv) Payment of Benefits to Contributors (Rs. M) 70 275 393%
According to the above data, it was observed that the expected targets had been determined unrealistically in the preparation
of the Action Plan.
(b) According to the Analysis of Funds Management included in the Financial Statements for the year under review presented
for Audit the maintenance of the members accounts in a manner to make it possible to notify the balance of the members’
accounts as at the end of the year had been one of the 04 major activities aimed at reaching the objectives of the Fund.
Nevertheless, updated individual accounts had not been maintained in a manner to make it possible to notify the balances of
the individual accounts to the members as at the end of the year under review.
3.9 Management Weaknesses :
The following management in-efficiencies were observed.
(a) According to Circulars No. 1/97 dated 31st July, 1997 and 14/2006 dated 30th October, 2006 of the Director General of
Pensions, advices relating to the money credited to the Fund in each month should be forwarded by the respective institutions
to reach the Secretary of the Fund before the 15th day of the month following. Nevertheless, such advices in respect of the
year 2009 had been forwarded only by a few institutions. The courses of action taken by the Fund to get those advices had
not reached the expected level. The Director General informed that such position was due to the lack of response from the
instutions concerned.
(b) An inspection carried out with regard to the grant the membership of the Public Service Provident Fund in terms of provisions
of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance No. 18 of 1942 and the Public Service Provident Fund (Amendment) Act,
No. 17 of 2003, to the non-pensionable officers and provide them with the benefits thereof revealed that no remittances to
the Fund had been made under 127 Heads of Expenditure. A course of action had not been in operation to identify those
employed therein and enroll them as members of the Fund and provide the benefits. The Director General of Pensions informed
that due to the absence of a methodology for the identification of employed in such institutions who are entitled to receive
benefits from the Fund, it had not been possible to implement a course of action to collect authorities.

4. Systems and Controls
Matters observed during the course of audit were brought to the notices of the Director General of Pensions from time to time.
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control.
(a) Obtaining Abatement Registers
(b) Collection of Contributions
(c) Settlement of Erroneous Debit and Credit Balances.
(d) Action on Audit Observations
Observations of the PSPF Management Board on the Report of the Auditor General concerning Accounts of the Public Service
Provident Fund for the year ending 31.12.2009.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Accounting Deficiencies
(a) Despite frequent notices by letters and calling over the telephone to relevant departments and ministries to settle the
balances  existed over past 5 years in erroneous debits and credits, the institutions had not taken any action in that regard.
Therefore above mentioned problematical situation could not solve. Nevertheless, most of the erroneous debits and
credits committed in year 2008 were corrected within the same year.
(b) This surplus existed due to most members are used to apply for their awards by elapse of long period of time subsequent
to the nullification of membership. On the other hand the awards granted only to the date of nullification of membership.
Hence the balance cash remained in the account. Investing the balance cash and remitting the interest benefits therein
to the government bonus also has been caused to have this surplus.
2.2.2 Non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations
(a) Section 25 of Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance
It is accepted to inform the balance and accordingly the balance only till year 1999 was informed. Unavailability of proper
information creates difficulties to make date base. At present we have initiated the task of computerizing the accounts
having built-up a computer program. However, noticing the balances by producing datum had been delayed as a result
that issuing awards for 27000 reserve police officers who absorbed into regular service, the casual employees in Postal
Service and all civil employees in Free Armed Forces who confirm in the post had to expedite. I pleased to inform that
in future the facility will be available to inform the balance under e-pension project.
(b) Section 10 and 1 (3) (a) of Public Service Provident Fund Act, No. 18 of 1942
The audit fees payable for auditing P. S. P. Fund during 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 had been allocated. Accordingly,
it is informed that the estimated values for audit fees were adjusted when preparing income and expenditure account.
Adjustments displayed below were done in compliance to the estimates produced by audit officers.
2005 92,236
2006 99,981
2007 110,694
2008 176,250
2009 173,040
However the bills for auditing after year 2004 were not forwarded to this fund and it is informed that all payments till year 2009
can release on receipt of those bills.
(c) Public Finance Circular No. PF/423 dated 22.12.2006
Paragraph 04.01
The budget estimates for year 2009 was duly forwarded to the Hon. Minister on 05.11.2008 and the Hon. Minister
of Public Administration and Home Affairs gave approval thereto. (Herewith attached a copy of the letter).

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 18.11.2011
Paragraph 04.03 (E)
The verification letters on credit balances of the accounts of the fund was regularly delayed to receive. These verification
letters had not received even at the time when the annual accounts of the fund was submitted for the auditing on
24.02.2010. We have already requested a balance verification letter from the Department of Public Accounts and the
accounts will be produced for the auditing after receiving the letter.
(d) Paragraph 03 (IV) of the Treasury Operation Circular 01/2008
The fact that the Treasury Circular 1/2008 should adhere for the purposes of investments got to know by the audit
draft for auditing year 2008. The relevant audit draft was received on 19.05.2009. Fixed deposits investments printed
in audit draft for the auditing in year 2009 were done on 06.04.2009 and 17.05.2009. Accordingly it is informed that
those two investments had done before receiving the audit draft for year 2008 and it is informed that the directions shown
in circular 1/2008 are followed at present and further informed that these shortcomings will not happen in future.
3. Financial and operating review
3.3 Percentage of interest entitled for members
The average contribution collection from year 1996 to 2009 has been increased. The appropriate interest percentage comparing
thereto was decreased as a result that contribution collection was raised in a phase by exceeding the growing phase of the interest
income. Even though the contribution so collected was increased, the actual cash flow could not see since the contributions
were credited by monthly account summaries. Therefore investing opportunities were declined. The preceding interest
percentage had been declined as a result that the reinvestments carried out in a low interest rate when previous investments
were matured. The interest percentage appropriated under these circumstances has been declined.
3.4 Trends in the improvement of membership and investments
A Slight increase in investments could observe due to receipt of cash imprest for government bonus in year 2009 and an increase
in number of members also observed. Opportunities for additional investments were not available comparing the growth of
membership since contributions received by account summaries but not as cash flow. Further, the investment opportunities
had been lessened as a result that employees in PSPF appointments were confirmed and had to make awards for service
concluded employees.
3.5 Interest income deprived from the fund
Letters sent to Secretary to the Treasury by informing that the interest rate would decline since the cash imprest had not received
to settle the balance of the account of Deputy Secretary to the Treasury and for the Government bonus. A discussion in this
regard was held with patronage of the Director General-Treasury Operations. Though a letter in this regard was sent on
16.03.2009 to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, cash not received yet.
It cannot accept the comment that this has happened due to abstain from taking any action to get remit cash from the Treasury
and it is informed that all necessary action had taken to get remit the money.
3.6 Staff Recourse
Applications received in year 2008 and 2009 have increased with comparing the year 2003 and this has caused to ascend the
workload that should cover by single officer. Lack of additional staff to deploy also has been caused to this difficulty.
3.7 Benefit payments for members
Applications received to obtain awards in year 2009 have been 6 times increased comparing the year 2004 and membership
enlistment also boosted by 40%. The available staff to cover all these advancements is the same as in year 2004. Hence, the
benefit payments have been delayed.
3.8 Operational performance
(a) Details in past years were based to formulate expected goals in year 2009. Comparing to year 2008 we could see a progress
in year  2009 at all activities of the division due to approving over-time, getting assistance of computer trainee students,
assigning additional staff for typing and assigning officers in other divisions on the basis of overtime payment. Accordingly
it is informed that the expected outcome was exceeded.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 18.11.2011
(b) Though it is necessary to maintain member accounts, it is informed that the fund had not maintained such accounts for
members instead we have maintained files by getting received abatement records from each institutions. Awards have
been made in accordance with those files. Therefore it is informed that the fund could not overcome this requirement at
once and further it could not expedite as a computer program for the fund was prepared only from year 2008.
3.9 Management weaknesses
(a) In addition to circular 1/97 action was taken to inform all departments and ministries by circular No. 14/2006 dated
30.10.2006 to get receive all credit notices to the Fund though the institutions concerned have not taken action to adhere.
Up to date they maintain a procedure of sending a list alone with cheques or a report. Due to these situations the progress
of productive actions which the fund expected for could not achieve. A public service provident fund instruction manual
was issued in this regard by Circular No. 04/2010 dated 25.05.2010 and the fund will meet with its expected progress.
(b) Only the central government institutions that have no pension entitlement but P. S. P. F. entitlement are crediting monthly
contributions by account summaries. Hence the names of only those institutions are printed in computer generated
treasury abstract. In addition, some central government institutions and provincial council institutions which have the
employees with P. S. P. F. entitlement are crediting contributions by cheques. Therefore, names of those institutions
are not enlisted  in computer generated treasury abstract. Accordingly all heads not printed to the computer generated
treasury abstract. Some institutions that have all expenditure heads as in the estimate may not have the officers with the
entitlement. Due to unavailablity of clear method to decide whether officers with P. S. P. F. entitled officers employed
or not in insitutions, it has been unable to implement a system to collect contributions.
