3.  Financial and Operating review
3.1 Financial Review
Financial Result
According to the financial statement presented the working
of the year ended 31 December 2008 had resulted in a deficit
of  Rs.10,441,719 after taking into account the Government
Grant  of    Rs.108,870,000  received for recurrent expenditure
as against the surplus of Rs.4,066,641 for the preceding
year  after taking into account the Government Grant of
Rs.91,300,000 received for recurrent expenditure for the
year, thus indicating an deterioration of Rs.14,508,360 in
the financial result.
3.2 Budgetary Control
Significant variances were observed between the revised
budget and the actual thus indicating that the budget had not
been made use of as an effective instrument of management
control
3.3 Cost per Student
Year Average per student
2006 1,572,965
2007 923,020
2008 439,321
2009 339,284
3.4 Uneconomic Transaction
The University entered in to a agreement with a private
Company to develop a Computer systems to use for
General Administration of the University in 2006. The
company had not furnished sufficient systems which had
been paid Rs.736,000 and the University had sustained a
loss of Rs.736,000  an action had not been taken to recover
the money from the company.
   3.5 Human Resource Management
According to the approved carder of the University, 36
Vacancies in the Academic staff & 70 Vacancies in Non-
academic staff had not been filled.
Approved Recurrent Budget Allocation was Rs.122,000,000 for the
year 2009. The Treasury released only Rs.108,870,000 for the
period. That is the major reason for the deficit of Rs.10, 441,719 for
the period. The deficit amount was accumulated due to non receipt
of total allocation every year.
As we have exercised effective control over expenditure, it has
resulted in favorable variation. We monitored outsourced services
and contractual expenditure effectively. However it is difficult to
forecast accurate income and expenditure due to development stage
of the University.
Capital expenditure is comparatively high at the initial stage of the
establishment of any University. It is not reasonable to evaluate cost
per student using capital expenditure. However action is being taken
to reduce the cost per student gradually.
The University Council has taken a decision to terminate this
contract after settlement of advance.
Academic Vacancies
Academic vacancies were advertised and we are in the process of
filling the academic vacancies by end of October2010.
Non Academic Vacancies
We have already filled the vacancies of Two Technical Officers,  store
keeper and  shroff. At present the clerical duties are performed by
Operations Assistants on assignment basis. Action has already been
initiated to fill the positions according to the approved cadre on
permanent capacity.

Although two audit and management committee meetings
had been held in the year under review, no action had taken
on the decisions taken regarding observations made in the
audit reports.

Four audit committee meetings were held during the year under
review and necessary action had been taken according to decisions
