My No.: EN/AM/B/SEUSL/FA/2009. 02nd December, 2010.
The Vice-Chancellor,
South Eastern University of Sri Lanka.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statement of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December,
2009 in terms of Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.
The audit of the financial statements of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December, 2009 was carried out
under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read
in conjunction with sections 108 (1) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of section 13 of the
Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. This report is issued in terms of section 108 (2) of the Universities Act. A detailed report in terms of section
13 (7) (a) of Finance Act was issued to the Vice Chancellor of the University on 07th October, 2010.
1.2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting standards. This responsibility includes, designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and
applying appropriate accouunting policies, and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1.3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on review of the financial statement presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and test were such as to enable as wide audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff, other
resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordnance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain reasonable
assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination on a test basis
of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting policies used and significant
estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statement as well as evaluating their overall presentation. I have
obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of my
audit. I therefore, believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance
Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination  and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that, the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st December, 2009 and
except for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements have
been prepared and presented in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the University as at 31st December, 2009 and the financial results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Accounting Policies
The value of the land had not been ascertained and brought to account and as a result the fixed assets had been understated.
2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
The following accounting deficiencies were observed.
(a) Fence to the value of Rs. 326,211 which had been demolished for the construction of parapet wall had not been eliminated
from the Fence Account. Hence, the fence account had been overstated by the same amount.
(b) Provision had not been made for audit fees amounting Rs. 200,000 for the year under review.
