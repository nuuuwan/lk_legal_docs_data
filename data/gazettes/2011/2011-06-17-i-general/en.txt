that the University of Sri Jayawardenepura had maintained proper accounting records for the year 31st December, 2007 and except
for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the University of
Sri Jayawardenepura as at 31st December, 2007 and the financial results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended.
