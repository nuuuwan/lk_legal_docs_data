and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1:3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff,
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auding Standards to obtain reasonable
assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination on a test
basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by the managment in the preparaton of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall presentation.
I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose
of my audit. I therefore, believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of
the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.

3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Review
3.1.1 Financial Results
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the University for the year under review had resulted in a deficit
of Rs. 626,517,307 before taking into account the Government grant for recurrent expenditure as compared with the corresponding
deficit of Rs. 580,089,260 for the preceding year. After taking into account the Government grant of Rs. 601,700,000 received for
recurrent expenditure, the deficit for the year under review had been reduced to Rs. 24,817,307 and the Government grant of
Rs. 579,853,000 received for recurrent expenditure for the preceding year had reduced the deficit of that year to Rs. 227,260.
3.1.2 Utilisation of Specific Funds
The funds had not been utilized for the purposes for which they were granted and transferred to fixed deposit to accrue interest
without proper authority. The balance of the account as at 31st December, 2008 aggregated to Rs. 798,869.
3.1.3 Uneconomic Transactions
Following observations are made :
(a) Seventy-seven numbers of direct telephone lines had been provided for facility and service units in the University and most of
those direct telephone lines had been utilized for internal communication in the University alothough, an internal communication
system was already available in the University. As a result, the payments of Rs. 6,332,930 made for telephone charges could have
been reduced to Rs. 1,386,000 if the Intercom system is in operation in its full capacity.
(b) Landscaping and cleaning charges amounting to Rs. 21,780 had been paid in respect of University premises. These jobs could have
been made by the labourers of the University.

distributed.
(c) A Multi Station Machine (Poly Station Gym) purchased for Rs. 750,000 had been remained unused for three years.

3.1.5 Identified Losses
Losses of fixed assets, stores items and books, to the value of Rs. 461,240 had been written off during the year under review.
3.1.6 Delays in Projects
Following observations are made:-
(a) A sum of Rs. 7,611,885 had been paid to a construction company during 1999 to 2000 for the construction work for an
Auditorium at Medical Faculty. However, construction works had not yet been fully completed. Further due to undue delay the
cost of construction would be increased tremendously and the objective of this building also had not been achieved. In addition
a sum of Rs. 13,000,000 had been paid to the Department of Buildings during the years 2005 and 2006 for the interior decoration
works, which was not yet commenced. As a result students of the Medical Faculty are being affected without this facility.
(b)  A sum of Rs. 2,607,050 had been paid in the year 2005 as an advance to Ceylon Electricity Board for the supply of Bulk
Electricity to the faculty of Agriculture at Kilinochchi. But that project had not yet been commenced.
(c) A sum of Rs. 2,000,000 had been paid to the Department of Buildings as an advance in 1989 for the construction of an overhead
tank for student’s hostel at Thirunelvely which had not yet been completed.
(d) A sum of Rs. 6,589,667 had been paid to purchase a land for the construction of building for the Faculty of Management and
Commerce. The project had not yet been commenced.
(e) A sum of Rs. 1,323,071 had been paid as Value Added Tax to a company in Colombo and another sum of Rs. 8,820,474 had been
paid from SIDA  IT Network Project to that company. However, no progress report of the above project had been made available
for audit. This project was commenced on early part of the year 2005, but it was not completed up to 31st October, 2009. As
a result objective of the project had not been achieved due to the delays in completion.
(f) Three advances amounting to Rs. 3,200,000, Rs. 3,014,000 and Rs. 5,615,000 had been released on 31st December, 2004, 16th
November, 2005 and 10th November, 2006 respectively to the Chief Engineer, Department of Buildings, North East Provincial
Council for the construction of overhead tank and sump for Vavuniya Campus at Pambaimadu.
The construction of sump work had been completed. However, the overhead tank and balance works had not been completed up
to 30th June, 2009 and the contract was terminated by the Department of Buildings. A sum of Rs. 2,439,956 had already been
paid to the contractor up to the termination. A fresh agreement with another contractor had been signed for balance works.
3:2 Appointment to the Academic Staff
Following observations are made :
(a) Appointments to the permanent posts of lecturers had been made separetely to each and every Faculty of the University as a
general rule resulting in engaging several lecturers in the same field of study. In preparing time tables of various Faculties, the
availability of the service of permanent lecturers in other Faculties had not been considered. Whenever the service of lecturers in
the permanent staff were required for another Faculty, separate letters of appointment had been issued to them as visiting
lecturers and additional lecture fees had been paid for such services.
(b) In several instances, temporary lecturers, tutors, demonstrators etc. had been appointed on the request made by the Heads of
Department of the University without following proper recruitment procedures.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 04.11.2011
(c)  The regular feature of the University in filling the vacant posts of academic staff is in an improper manner without giving a n
opportunity to complete those who have qualifications and expected employment in the University system. Although this had
been pointed out in my reports for the last several years, no action had been taken to rectify these deficiencies.
3:3 Courses and Examinations
Following observations are made :
(a) Total numbers of students registered in 10 courses of the University were 6,165. Total recurrent expenditure incurred during the
year under review amounted to Rs. 372,051,361. The average recurrent cost per student for the year was Rs. 60,349.
(b) Dates to hold the examinations for various courses conducted under each faculty of the University and target dates to release
results of the examinations had not been determined. It was further observed that there were considerable delays in releasing the
results of examinations conducted by certain Faculties during the years 2007 and 2008. According to the University Grants
Commission Circular No. 636 of 14th July, 1995 results should be released within three months after the examination. But
results had been delayed by periods ranging from 6 to 12 months.
(c) Total number of students who appeared for the examination held during the year had not been furnished to audit.
3:4 Granting Leave with Pay and No Pay for Postgraduate Studies
Following observations are made :
(a) Study leave had been approved for more than one year to the lecturers who had gone abroad for studies without taking into
consideration of the instructions stipulated in Section 27.4 of Chapter 10 of the Establishments Code for the University Grants
Commission and the Higher Educational Institutions.
(b) There were instances of approving study leave to lecturers under probationary period before completing one year service.
3:5 Budgetary Control
Major variations were observed between the budget and the actuals thus indicating that the budget had not been made use of as an
effective instrument of management control.
4. Systems and Controls
Deficiencies observed during the course of audit were brought to the notice of the Vice Chancellor of the University by my detailed report
issued in terms of Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance Act. Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control:-
(a) Personnel Management,
(b) Budget,
(c) Stores,
(d) Contract Adminstration,
(e) Library Administration,
(f) Fixed Assets.

(iii) Salary Advance of Rs. 16,760 for Displaced Staff. – It had been written off in 2009.
(iv) Building Advance:- Action had been taken to settle the unsettled advance in 2009.
(v ) Staff Loan :- Due to the following reasons the loan had been unrecovered for a long period of time.
1. Staff who left from the service are not submitted the documents related to the refund of UPF in time. Therefore, the loan
dues cannot be recovered.
2. Academic staff who had been granted paid leave for their higher studies converted their leave as no pay leave. This is due
to non recovery of the loan installment. The loan recovery will be recommended on resume of duties. In the meantime
action is being taken to inform them to pay monthly installment during their no pay leave.
(b) Most of the receivable amounts represent the balance of loans/advances paid to the Employees and the payable account
represents the students deposit and staff security deposit. Therefore, no confirmation is needed.

2:2:3 Due to non submission of details of the sum of Rs. 1,650,137,533 by the Audit we are unable to make any comments on this
observation.
2:2:4 University complies with the provisions in the Universities Act, E. Code and Circulars etc. as far as possible and practicable.
3:1:3 (a) Action has been taken to resume the Swedish International Development agent funded Networking, system at University.
Once this is finished the additional charges are expected to be reduced.
(b) Our Carder of un-skilled laborers was increased only by three numbers for more than 25 years. Whereas the land and Building
maintained rapidly (more than 4 fold). Further nearly 1/3 of the vacancies at Maintenance Branch remain unfilled. We have
no other alternative than outsourcing. These were outsourced when the in house staff were engaged/occupied with more
important, urgent works please.
3:1:4 (a) Since the Purchasing Officer is appointed. The scooter in Jaffna and in Colombo could be used.
(b) Since most of these books are research publications there is no big demand from the public. However action has been taken
to dispose with a price reduction.
(c) Multi Station Machine (Roly Station Gym) was purchased in July, 2006 and was in use for a short period. Due to the
disturbed situation in Jaffna from August, 2006 the students could not make use this machine. However the Instructors are
using this machine.

(g) The University is unable to introduce the time recording machine due to objection of the Employees.
(h) Due to the situation prevailed in the peninsula the expected student have not arrived to the Hostels and other rented houses
arranged by the University of Jaffna. The Beds will be given to the Hostel of the Medical students on completion of
constructions.
3:1:6 (a) The Balance work of Auditorium was entrusted to the Dept. of Buildings (Central) and Rs. 13,000,000.00 has already been
released. We have requested the Dept. of Buildings to Complete the work early.
(b) This work was not executed due to unsettled conditions which gradually started in December, 2005 and complete standstill
after August, 2006. We have requested the CEB to refund the money.
(c) The Department of Buildings initiating action to recommence the work and submitted a revised estimate. Action is being
taken to release the fund.
(d) Consultancy Service with supervision has already been awarded to the Dept. of Buildings and the Dept. of Bulding has
commenced designing.
(e) IT networking project had been undertaken by the University of Colombo School of Computing under the SIDA IT
Networking Project. According to the terms and conditions the University of Jaffna had to meet the payment of V AT.
Accordingly the University paid Rs. 1,323,071.10 as V AT to the Enterprise Technology (Pvt) Ltd. who is the Contractor
assigned the contract by the University of Colombo School of Computing. Further University of Jaffna had not paid
Rs. 8,820,474 to the University of Colombo School Computing. This amount was paid by the University of Colombo School
of Computing to the contractor. The audit can obtain the project report from the University of Colombo School of
Computing.
(f) This work was awarded to the Dept. of Buildings (Province) by the University Council in the year 2004. The work had not
been completed so far. The delay may be due to the termination of contrat between the Dept. of Buildings and the contractor
in 2006 and prevailing situation at Vavuniya especially in Pampaimadu.
3:2 ( a) The permanent teaching staff are involved in Faculty as well as interfaculy teaching without any additional remuneration
other than their salary. When the teaching load of a teacher in his/her departments/Faculty is far in excess of the approved
academic norms of a particular academic position, payment is made by appointing them as visiting lecturers for the lectures
they take out side their academic norms in departments out side the faculty to which they belong to. Only a small number
of such visiting appointments are made under inevitable circumstances.
Cadres are determined by the University Grants Commission based on the needs of each Faculty. Further although the title
of the “Field of Study” may look alike, the scope of the course and the courses contents could be very different. For
example the way Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is taught in a Science Faculty is different from how it is taught in
an Engineering Faculty.
(b) The temporary posts in Assistant Lecturer, Tutor, Demonstarator and instructors are regularly advertised before the
commencement of every academic year and recruitment is made by following the proper recruitment procedure.
However when an appointed person resigns or leaves the service during an academic year and when there is no adequate
time to fill the vacancy by advertisement, appointments are made on the request of the Head and the Dean in a very few
occasions, so as to carry out the academic programme within the Scheduled academic calendar. Such appointments (a few)
are made only for the balance period of the appointments of the person resinged.
(c) Other than getting the services of a few senior academics on work assignment (or contract) basis, no other appointments
were made without giving opportunity to those who have the qualification to complete. All vacant positions are advertised
regularly and all eligible applicants in terms of the scheme of recruitment are called for interviews and they are evaluated by
legally constituted selection boards. Appointments are made based on the recommendations of selection committees,
thereby giving opportunities to all the eligible applicants.
3:3 ( b) In some Faculties examinations are conducted at the end of the academic year. In some at the end of each semester. However
the results of the examinations conducted at the end of the first semester are released along with the result of the second
semester. This is the examinations regulations. This is because of the results are released for each semester, there is a
possibility of students skipping two out of five course units in the second semester. However the structures of the Degree

for publication in the respective weekly Gazette. All notices received out of times specified below will not be
published. Such notices will be returned to the sender by post for necessary amendment and return if publication
is desired in a subsequent issue of the Gazette. It will be in the interest of all concerned if those desirous of ensuring
the timely publication of notices in the Gazette  make it a point to see that sufficient time is allowed for postal
transmission of  notices to the Government Press.
The Government Printer does not accept payments of subscription for the Government Gazette.
Payments should be made direct to the
