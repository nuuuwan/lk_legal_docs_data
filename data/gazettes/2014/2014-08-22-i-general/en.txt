2.2 Financial Instruments
2.2.1 Non-derivative Financial Assets
The Fund recognises financial assets or financial liabilities in its statement of financial position when the funds
becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributab le
to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability(other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair val ue
through profit or loss) are added or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or liability, as appropriate, on
initial recognition. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented when, and only when the Fund has a legal
right to offset the amount and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
The Fund has following non-derivative financial assets: held to maturity financial assets, loans and available for sale
financial assets.
2.2..1.1 Held to Maturity Financial Assets
A non-derivative financial asset with fixed or determinable payments with fixed maturity where Fund intends to
hold to maturity is classified under this category.
Held to maturity financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Held to maturity financial assets comprise to T Bills and T Bonds.
2.2.1.2 Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables comprise of staff loans and trade and other receivables.
2.2.1.3. Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are recognised as available or sale or not
classified in any previous categories. Available for sale financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus
any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses,
are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity.When an
investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or
loss.
Available for sales financial assets comprise of equity investments.
2.2.1.4. Derecognition of Financial Assets
The Fund derecognises a financial assets when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or
when it transfers the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially at the risks and rewards of ownership
of the financial assets are transferred or in which fund neither transfers nor substantially all risk and rewards of
ownership and it does not retain control of the financial assets.
Transactions in which the fund neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
a financial assets and it retains control over the assets,the Fund continues to recognise the assets to the extent of
its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the
transferred asset.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.08.2014
On recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the assets (or the carrying
amount allocated to the portion of the assets transferred), and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including
any new assets obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been
recognised in order comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss.
The Fund derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.
2.2.2. Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities
The Fund initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated.
All other liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Company becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
The Fund classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into other financial liabilities category. Such financial liabilities
are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition,
these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities comprise interest bearing borrowings, banks, overdraft and trade and other payables.
Bank overdraft that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Fund’s cash management are included as
a component of cash and cash equivalents for the statement of cash flows.
2.2.2.1 De-recognition of Financial Liability
The Fund derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when
and only when, the Fund has a legal right to offset the amounts and either to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset or settle the liability simultaneously.
2.2.3 Amortised Cost Measurement
The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at
initial recognition, minus principal repayments and any impairment and plus/minus the cumulative amortisation using
the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus
any reduction for impairment.
2.2.4. Fair Value Measurement
Fair Value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing
parties in an arm’s length transaction on the measurement date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in an active market at each reporting date is determined by
reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation
techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions: reference to the current fair
value of another instrument that is substantially the same, a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
2.2.5. Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Fund’s non financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.If any such indication exists, the
assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs
to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a per tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset or cash
generating unit. In determining fair value less costs to sell on appropriate valuation made is used.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated
recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit and loss. An impairment loss is reserved if there has
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.08.2014
2.2.5.1 Impairment of Non-derivative Financial Assets
Financial assets other than those measured at fair value are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each
reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that as a result of
one or more event that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial assets, the estimated future cash from
the asset have been affected.
The Fund assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial assets or a group
financial assets is impaired. A financial assets or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only
if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset and that loss event have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset
or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
a. Impairment Losses on Financial Assets carried at Amortised Cost
Impairment losses on assets carried at amortised cost are measured as the difference between the carrying amount
of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original
effective interest rate.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account against loans and advances.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is
reversed through profit or loss.
b. Impairment Losses on Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
Impairment Losses on Available-for-Sale investment securities are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss
that has been recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. The
cumulative loss that is reclassified from other comprehensive income to Profit or loss is the difference between the
acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value,less any impairment
loss previously recognised in profit or loss. Changes in impairment provisions attributable to time value are
reflected as a component of interest income.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impairment available-for-sale debt security increases and the increase
can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the
impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of reversal recognised in profit or loss. However, any subsequent
recovery in the fair value of an impaired available-for-Sale equity security is recognised in other comprehensive
income.
2.3. Inventories
No physical verification was carried out at end of the Financial Year and Inventories are valued by management.
2.4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments, readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and deposits in banks net of
outstanding bank overdrafts.
2.5. Liabilities and Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a pest event, the Fund has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be
measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised
as finance cost.
Capital Commitments and Contingencies
Capital Commitments and Contingent liabilities of the Fund are disclosed in the respective notes to the Financial
Statements.
2.6. Employees Benefit

and the Employees’ Trust Fund,respectively and is recognised as an expense in profit and loss in the periods during
which services are rendered by employees.
2.6.3. Short-Term Benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus if the
Fund has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past services provided by the
employee and the obligation can be measured reliably.
2.7. Provisions
Provision for legal claims are recognized when the Fund has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
estimated reliably.

reflecting the current assessment of the time value of money and specific risks relevant for the obligation. The increase in
provision due to time passage is recognized as an interest expense.
