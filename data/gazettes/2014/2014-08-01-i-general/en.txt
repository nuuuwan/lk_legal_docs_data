PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 01.08.2014
1:2 Management’ s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error.
1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal contr ol
relevant to the University’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3
and 4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope
and the extent of the audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit opini on.
1:4 Basis for Qualified Opinion:
My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Qualified  Opinion :
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements give a  true
and fair view of the financial position of the University of Colombo as at 31st December, 2012 and its financial performance an d
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard.
