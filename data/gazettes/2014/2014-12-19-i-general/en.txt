into account During December to April in the above Building Engineers and workers who work under SIDA project for the It
network project stayed there and completed and finalized all the work. University has signed the agreement with SIDA in which
it was agreed to provide accommodation and electricity and other amenities free for those who were engaged by way of SIDA

higher electricity charges during that period. Further, CEB has reported connection wiring malfunctions during the period in the
line supplying electricity to the said building and losses have been reported to be occurred to faulty earthing in the surroundings.
This fact could be verified from the CEB as it has rectified it later after informing the University. Only the basic electrical

Faculty of Law, University of Colombo are prepared to take Lectures for the 4th year students in Colombo Center

department, Ramanathan Academy of Fine Arts and Unit of Siddha Medicine to confirm the arrival and departure. Administrative

1124 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2014'12'19
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.12.2014
As per the above detail, no staff had been recruited excessively as at 31.12.2012. However, during the year 2012, 146
temporary academic staff had been appointed whereas 66 temporary staff bad resigned their position or been terminated
from the services. Further, six advertisements were made to fill the academic positions in the year 2012 and another two
advertisements were made in the month of December 2011 to fill such vacancies. The University had made following
numbers of permanent recruitment to the academic grades in the year 2011, 2012 and 2013 to date.
2011 - 30
2012 - 29
2013 to date - 22
The above details clearly reveal that the University of Jaffna has taken all efforts to fill its existing academic vacant
positions promptly. Even though the efforts taken by the administration as described above to fill vacancies, the
University was unable to fill the 33 positions of Professor Chair as there was no application received with required
qualifications despite of repeated advertisements. Such situation is prevailed even for the position of Senior Lecturer/
Lecturer in some disciplines in the Faculty of Medicine. In such circumstances the University filled these vacant
positions by Temporary Lecturers, Temporary Instructors or by Temporary Demonstrators in order to carry out the
academic programmes without interruption.
(ii) Out of forum approved academic cadre of the Sports Science Unit, three were filled and action is being taken to fill
other vacant position. It is compulsory to the existing two Lecturers (prob.) to acquire necessary postgraduate
qualification within the maximum. probationary period of eight years; otherwise, they will be terminated from the’
services in terms of section 72 of Universities Act, No.16 of 1978 amended by Universities Act, No.7 of 1985 and 1 of
1995. Further both of them were awarded HETC schoIarship and NCAS funding for postgraduate studies in the year
2011 and their eights probationary period will expire in June 2014. Having considered the above and the fact that there
was another Senior Lecturer in services, the University Council granted study leave to these Probationary Lecturers to
complete their Ph.D. programme within June 2014. But, unfortunately the Senior Lecturer in Sports Science went on
maternity leave with pay and then on No pay maternity leave. Therefore, the University was forced to carry out the
academic programme of Sports Science Unit with Temporary and Visiting appointments.
(b) Academic Staff in the University system do not generally sign in the Attendance Register. However this matter was brought to
the notice at its 372th Meeting of the Council dated 29.09.2012 and it was pointed out at the meeting that nowhere in the world
academic staff are expected to sign in the Attendance Register and no action should be taken in this regard. Deans of Faculties
endorsed this view. A decision is awaited to implement the finger scanner to record attendance of all other staff. Moreover,
Executive officers, staff recruited on temporary/contract/casual/assignment basis and trainees have now been using the finger
scanner machine to record their attendance and it is emphasized to extend this to other non-academic Staff as well who will be
appointed in near future.
3.2.5
(a) The AppointmentlReinstatement of the two staff that was made in concurrence with the decision of the UGC by its Letter
No. UGC/HR/3/UJF dated 27.02.2013.
(b) Members are appointed in accordance with the regulations in respect of the posts for which the oral tests were conducted. As
such, depending on the posts and level of competencies that each post requires the composition of members may differ, but
were constituted in consistence with the scheme of recruitment.
No specific constitution for members for selection boards was in the universities Act or Regulations. Panel for the
members for conformation of services is appointed by the head of the institution (Vice Chancellor) if there is no specific
scheme given in the scheme of Recruitment in terms of provisions in scheme of recruitment and UGC guidelines where it is
stated on the composition of the selection Boards that:
For the Administration Officers the Chairman is the Vice Chancellor
For other Non-Academic staff Registrar is the Chairman.
Two permanent staff are as other members.
3.2.6
