b. Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except where appropriate disclosures are made with
regard to fair value under relevant notes.
c. Comparative information
Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of the previous
period for all amounts reported in the financial statements in order to enhance the understanding of the financial statements
of the current period and to improve the  inter- period comparability.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements,
unless otherwise indicated.
When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements have been amended, comparative amounts have
also been reclassified to conform with the current year in order to provide a better presentation.
During the reporting period the following reclassifications have been made.
• Loss on disposal of fixed assets amounting to Rs.82,000/- which had been classified under other operating
income has been reclassified under other expenses.
• Certain branch expenses amounting to Rs.168,000/-which had been classified under direct expenditure on students’
& members’ activities have been reclassified under communication expenses.

Institute.
All financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise.
e. Use of key estimates and critical judgements
The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with SLFRS/LKAS requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 25.04.2014
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the notes 1.3.1, 8.1,
and 8.2 to the financial statements.
1.2 ASSETS AND THE BASES OF THEIR VALUATION
1.2.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or at fair value less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses.
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses. Significant components of an asset are identified and depreciated separately. When significant parts of property,
plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the entity derecognises the replaced part, and recognises the
new part with its own associated useful life and depreciation. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the
income statement as incurred.
(b) Cost
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing the
asset to working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent expenditure incurred for the purpose of acquiring, extending or improving assets of a permanent nature in order
to carry on or increase the earning capacity of the assets has been treated as capital expenditure.
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately,
including major inspection and overhaul expenditure, is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is
probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Institute and its cost can be measured
reliably.
(c) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on the straight line basis at the following rates per
annum in order to write off the cost of such assets over their estimated useful lives.
Generator 10%
Furniture and Equipment 10%
Air- Conditioning Equipment 10%
Audio Visual Equipment 20%
Motor Vehicles 10%
Computers 20%
Canteen Equipment 10%
Head Office Refurbishment 10%
Elevator 10%
Building on lease hold land has been depreciated over 50 years based on the estimated useful life time of the building.
Though the lease period expires on 23
rd February 2037 and it is virtually certain that it will be renewed for another
30 years.
Branch refurbishment expenses are written off over the lease period of the buildings (5 years).
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified  as
held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Significant items of property plant and equipment with different useful lives were separately identified and depreciated.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 25.04.2014
(d) De-recognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected
from its use. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the assets is included in the statement of comprehensive income in the
year the asset is derecognised.
1.2.2 Work-in-Progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of
buildings awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property,
plant and equipment when it is available for use i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by Institute. Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, including borrowing costs,
less any accumulated impairment losses.
1.2.3 Educational material - IRQUE project
Assets acquired under this project are depreciated on the following bases:
(a) Cost of library books are written off on the straight line method over a period of 3 years.
(b) Cost of Multimedia English Learning Centre (MELC) software is written off on the straight line method over a period
of 4 years.
1.2.4 Intangible assets
An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will
flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard
LKAS 38 – Intangible Assets. Accordingly, these assets are stated in the statement of financial position at cost less
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on the straight line method.
Curriculum development cost is written off on the straight line method over a period of 5 years.
1.2.5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in th e
ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on
weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their
existing location and condition.
Other inventory items are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
1.2.6 Impairmentof assets
The carrying amounts of the assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised
if the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed if
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
1.2.7 Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of LKAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,loans and
receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments
in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Institute determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recogniti on.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of assets not at fair value through profit or los s,
directly attributable transaction costs.

313I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2014'04'25
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 25.04.2014
The Institute initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial
assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which t he
Institute becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Institute derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expires, or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all t he
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset is transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is
created or retained by the Institute is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Institute has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The financial assets of the Institute include cash and short term investments and trade and other receivables.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated
upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are
acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with
changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
The Institute has not designated any financial asset upon initial recognition at fair value though profit or loss.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance
income in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income in finance costs.
Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, employee loans, deposits, advances, other receivables and cash and cash
equivalents.
(c) Held-to-maturity investments (HTM)
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held-to-maturity
when the Institute has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After initial measurement, held-to-
maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less impairment. The
EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in financial costs.
Investments in government securities and fixed deposits have been classified under HTM investments.
(d) Available-for-sale financial investments
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not
classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair val ue
and changes therein, other than impairment losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair
value reserved in funds and reserves. Interest income on available-for-sale debt securities is calculated using the effective
interest rate method (EIR) and is recognised in profit or loss. When an investment is derecognised, the gain or loss
accumulated in funds and reserves reclassified to profit or loss.
The Institute has not designated any financial asset upon initial recognition as available-for-sale investment.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 25.04.2014
1.2.7.1 Impairment of financial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired and if such impairment has occurred, that amount of  impairment is calculated by taking the
difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flow.
1.2.8 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows,
which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
1.3      LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS
Liabilities classified as current liabilities on the statement of financial position are those which fall due for payment on
demand or within one year from the reporting date. Non-current liabilities are those balances that fall due for payment after
one year from the reporting date.
All known liabilities have been accounted for in preparing these financial statements. Provisions and liabilities are recognise d
when the Institute has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
1.3.1Employee benefits
(a) Provision for retiring gratuity
The Institute has adopted the benefit plan as required under the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 for all eligible
employees. The benefit plan is not externally funded. Provision for gratuity is computed by the Institute taking into
account the recommendations of an independent qualified actuaries firm, Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private)
Limited. The actuarial valuation was done for the first time in 2010.
Defined benefit plans estimate the amount of benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on
one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The cost of retirement gratuity are determined by a qualified actuary using projected unit credit method. This item is
stated under Non-current liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as
income or expense in other comprehensive income during the financial year in which it arise.
The key assumptions used by Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited include the following:
Rate of discount 10% per annum
Rate of Salary Increase 5% - 10%
Retirement Age 55 years
That the Institute will continue as a going concern
Sensitivity Analysis to salary escalation rate
Present value of defined benefit obligation Rs.
One percentage point increase 22,544,747
One percentage point decrease 23,519,116
Sensitivity Analysis to discount rate
One percentage point increase 23,561,273
One percentage point decrease 22,497,260

(b) Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment plan under which an entity pays fixed contribution into a separate
entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay a further amount. Obligations for contributions to defined
contribution plan are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as and when they are due.

SLFRS 9 replaces LKAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as
defined in LKAS 39. The mandatory effective date of this standard has been deferred. The adoption of the first phase of
SLFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Institute’s financial assets, but will potentially
have no impact on classification and measurement of financial liabilities. The Institute will quantify the effect in conjunctio n
with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
b. SLFRS 13-Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under SLFRS for all fair value measurements. SLFRS 13 does not state
when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under SLFRS when
fair value is required or permitted. The Institute is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the
financial position and performance. This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January
2014.

1.8 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through a disposal rather than through continuing use are
classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, these assets are re-measured in accordance
with the Institute’s accounting policies. Thereafter the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losses on re-
measurement are recognised in the profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.

* Rectification of cost of the buildings - Note 30
8.1  Buildings are situated on 2 blocks of land obtained on lease from the Government of Sri Lanka on a 99-year lease ending on  31st December, 2060 and the 30-year lease
ending on 23rd February, 2037. However the cost of the building is depreciated over a period of 50 years, as it is virtually ce rtain that it will be renewed for another 30
years.
8.2 Depreciation method was changed during the year from reducing balance method to straight line method which resulted in addi tional depreciation of Rs.15.1mn and the
corresponding grant amortisation amounted to Rs.5.3mn. Impact to the bottom line is Rs.9.7mn.
8.3 Non current assets held for sale represent the assets abandoned and replaced under alterations and additions to the existing tw o storeyed building and auditorium.
