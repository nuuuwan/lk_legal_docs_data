PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 25.07.2014
2.1 (d)
During the year Rs. 244,581 worth office equipments and library books amounting Rs. 3,609,853,43 were received to the University
from the Higher Education for Twenty First Century Project. As the ownership of the assets are not yet transferred to the
University, the cost of the Assets were not shown as University Assets.
2.2 Inventories
The First in First Out method (FIFO) is adopted to value cost of inventories. Inventories were physically verified and valued
at cost to ascertain the current value as at the Balance Sheet date.
2.3 Loans and Advances to Staff :
Actual Loan Balance to be recovered from staff members is considered as receivable.
3. Provisions for Gratuity

6. Accounting for Grants
Recurrent grants are recognized in the Income and Expenditure Statement on cash basis. Cost of rehabilitation of Fixed Assets and Capital
Grants for construction and new work recognized either as work in progress or Capital Assets where necessary.
7. Income Recognition
7.1 Government Grants for Recurrent Expenditure, Student Bursaries and Mahapola were recognized on cash basis.
7.2 Revenue is recognized over the period of instruction to match with the relevant expenditure of the respective course.
8. Prior year adjustment
During the year 2000 part of the roof of the library building was collapsed. The University incurred Rs. 9,176,071 in 2006 to bring
the library building to the original condition. In preparing 2006 financial statements this subsequent expenditure was capitalized as
part of the cost of the library building. This expenditure did not resulting the originally assessed level of performance of the building.
The LKAS 14 does not permit capitalization of this subsequent expenditure since it did not resulting increasing originally assessed
level of performance. This error had now been rectified by deducting Rs. 9,176,071 from the building and adjusting it to the general
reserve since this amount relate to previous financial period.
9. Accounting for Government Grant for Capital Expenditure
Government Grant for the capital expenditure has presented in the financial statements in accordance with the LKAS 20. According
to the accounting standard capital grant has recognized as deferred income in the statement of financial position and amortized over
the useful life of the asset. Capital grant relevant for previous years are also adjusted accordingly and Rs. 1,313,826,100 has adjusted
to the general reserve since that amount relate to previous financial period.
2.1 Qualified Opinion
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the financial position of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura as at 31st December, 2012 and its financial
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
