Students (some of them are two years duration and some are conducted in two different centers). The main reason for the
delay is getting the scripts marked by second examiners, most of whom are from outside the University. In addition to this
there has been considerable delay due to the situation that prevailed in and around the University. Now we are taking every
effort to complete these courses within the stipulated time.
The courses conducted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies are very popular and useful to the students in their career
development and to render their services to the society in a most effective manner. Further these courses provide an
opportunity for the University to achieve one of its prime objectives, which is the mission of the University.
The Faculty of Graduate Studies is conducting classes only during the week ends and after working hours. This arrangement
does not in any way disturb the normal functioning of the University.
(b) In spite of several attempts made by the University through newspaper advertisements etc the University did not receive
applications to recruit staff for senior positions with the required qualifications. To keep the academic programmes going

PART   I :  SEC .  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.10.2007
on it became necessary to employ the retired dons. Although Cabinet memoranda were sent through the University Grant
Commission to get approval for re-employment as recommended by the University Council no response was received. To
carry out the academic programmes the services of Prof. V. Tharmaratnam was obtained on assignment basis. Later the UGC
gave the approval to get the services of Prof. V. Tharmaratnam on assignment basis taking into consideration the lack of Senior
staff in Mathematics.
The three teachers referred to in Section 3.1.3(a) of the report were employed in the previous years and not in 2005.
When there is a dearth of qualified teachers in some disciplines, and when no applications are received to fill the cadre vacancies,
there is no alternative other than to employ retired staff, if they are available. Some of the departments have more that 50%
of the senior cadre positions unfilled. In  those Departments it is not adequate to employ outsiders or retired university teachers
as Visiting Lecturers. In addition to taking Lecturers, Senior hands are required to assist, guide and supervise the students
in their projects, assignments, continues assessments etc. Teachers (on contract) are appointed only to a few departments
which are very much in dearth of qualified senior staff in the Faculties of Medicine and Science.
When teachers are appointed on assignment basis their fixed salary is determined as that of the basic salary of the position
he/she held at the time of retirement. If these appointees are entitled to receive gratuity, ETF and UPF according to the Laws
of the country, the payment of benefits shall not be considered as liability but as legal obligation.
Although economical, the needs of certain very poorly staffed departments cannot be fulfilled by visiting appointments as
has been explained above.
(c) The University has provided official telephones only to a limited number  of officers who are entitled for the same.
The existing intercom telephone system (PABX system) which was installed about 25 years ago is now outdated and not
functioning. The University made attempts to repair the system but did not succeed. Technical Officers from the Sri Lanka
Telecom, Jaffna have also inspected the system and reported that the system cannot be repaired.
During the year 2003 tenders were  invited to obtain consultancy service for the Supply, installation, testing and
commissioning of a PABX system to University of Jaffna. The University Council at its 277th Meeting held on 26.07.2003
decided to with hold the memo submitted to obtain the Consultancy Service from a private Company in order to get information
from other Universities regarding the network system including the intercom facilities.
Further the network system to connect all the departments and branches for inter-communication is being installed under
the SIDA Projet by the Faculty of Science. Hence once the installation of network system is completed, the telephone charges
can be reduced.
(d) Due to the situation prevailing in our country there was a frequent disruption in transport and communication. The staff
who wants to go abroad had to make their travel arrangements within a short period. Cosidering the difficulties faced by the
staff payments were made to the Air Lines before the visa was issued. However the University has decided to make payments
after confirming that the visa had been issued.
3.1.5 (a) No work for which agreements were signed before 1989 remain incomplete. But Arts Faculty Complex and Ramanathan
Academy of Fine Arts started before 1989 remain incomplete. As these were very big projects works were entrusted to the
Department  of Buildings in stages, and the completed stages(Buildings) are being used. Please note that from 1990-1996
there was total ban on transport of construction materials to the north and there were restrictions and free transport was
not possible until A-09 highway was opened in April, 2002.
(b) The Rs. 7,611,885 paid was for the balance work of stage 1 which did not include finishes, decoration, sheeting etc. After
completing the documentation for interior decoration work tenders were called thrice. But on each occasion the University
Tender Board could not recommend a successful bidder. Later the University Council awarded this part of the work to the
Department of Buildings who needed an advance in full to start work.
(c) There is neither a Maintenance stores  nor a Store Keeper at the Maintenance Branch. The store items received from the Finance
Branch are recorded in a register and issued for work. Once issued for work the balance is considered as nil. Since the
Maintenance Branch was not closed during the year end and as there was continuous work there are chances of few items
of job in progress available in the workshop. Some of the works continue for several days.

The amount of Rs. 2,116,555 as indicated by the Auditor General is for the minor repairs of buildings/Structure/Services and
not for the day to day upkeep.
(d) Construction of Faculty of Agriculture under NECORD funding has commenced in September 2005 at Ponnagar, Kilinochchi
but behired schedule as at present.
(e) This work was suspended by the Department of Buildings in 1990 due to war like situation in Jaffna. Subsequently two number
wells and pump house were completed in1999. We have written and reminded the Department of Buildings to complete the
work on  the water tank.
(f) These allocations were made for the approved cadre of the Engineering Faculty of the University of Jaffna. No allocation has
been made by the University Grants Commission for Buildings. Also the Government has not issued the required Gazette
notification to establish a Faculty of Engineering.
(g) Action has already been taken to issue Guide books to students by the respective Faculties. Many Faculties have published
students hand books.
3:2:1 (a) The permanent teaching staff are involved in faculty as well as interfaculty teaching without any additional remuneration other
than their salary. When the teaching load of a teacher in his/her departments/Faculty is far in excess of the approved academic
norms of a particular academic position, payment is made by appointing them as visiting lecturers for the lectures they take
out side their academic norms in departments out side the faculty to which they belong to. Only a small number of such visiting
appointments are made under inevitable circumstances.
Cadres are determined by the University Grants Commission based on the needs of each faculty. Further although the title
of the “Field of Study” may look alike, the scope of the course and the courses contents could be very different. For example
the way physics, chemistry and mathematics is taught in a science faculty is different from how it is taught in an engineering
faculty.
(b) The temporary posts in Assistant Lecturer, Tutor, Demonstrator and instructors are regularly advertised before the
commencement of every academic year and recruitment is made by following the proper recruitment procedure.
However when an appointed person resigns or leaves the service during an academic year and when there is no adequate time
to fill the vacancy by advertisement, appointments are made on the request of the Head and the Dean in a very few occasions,
so as to carry out the academic programme within the scheduled academic calendar. Such appointments (a few) are made only
for the balance period of the appointments of the person resigned.
(c) Other than getting the services of a few senior academics on work assignment (or contract) basis, no other appointments were
made without giving opportunity to those who have the qualification to compete. All vacant positions are advertised regularly
and all eligible applicants in terms of the scheme of recruitment are called for interviews and they are evaluated by legally
constituted selection  boards. Appointments are made based on the recommendations of selection committees, thereby giving
opportunities to all the elegible applicants.
(d) Both staff were reinstated as per the related Public Administration Circular No. 11/1993 of 04/06/1993 adopted by the UGC
Establishment Circular letter No. 13/1993 of 14/07/1993.
3:2:2 The requested information shall be furnished in the future.
3:2:3 (b) In some Faculties examinations are conducted at the end of the academic year. In some at the end of each semester. However
the results of the examinations conducted at the end of the first semester are released along with the result of the second semester.
This is their examinations regulations. This is because if the results are released for each semester, there is a possibility of
students skipping two out of five course units in the second semester. However, the structure of the Degreee Programme are
changed now and for the new batches of students results are released within threee months.
3:2:4 (a&b) The sections of the Establishment Code of the University Grants Commission and the Higher Educational Institutions referred
to in these paragraphs were amended by the University Grants Commission Circular No. 429 of 02/03/1990 by which the
authority is delegated to the Councils of Universities to use their discretions for the timing of granting study leave to teachers.
3:3 The following steps have been taken with regard to Budgetary Control.
