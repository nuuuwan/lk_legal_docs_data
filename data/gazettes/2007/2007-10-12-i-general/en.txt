Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Significant Accounting Policies
1.1 Reporting Entity
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (hereafter referred to  as the ‘Institute’) was incorporated by an Act of
Parliament No. 23 of 1959. The Head Office is situated at No. 30A, Malalasekera Mawatha, Colombo 7.

<!-- page 7 -->

851I ï¤å·Ì :  (I) ïﬂ…˘  - ˚òØ ¨â¤å Àò°å”å¾à”òŁ¤ Ì˜å°Éå…ß °¾˙°ï˘à “æÌ À”ò˘ - 2007.10.12
PART   I :  SEC .  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 12.10.2007
1.2 Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS) and are based on
historical costs and do not take into account changing money values, except where stated. Cost is based on the fair values of the
consideration given in exchange for assets. The accounting policies are consistent with those used in the previous year. The financial
statements were authorised for issue by the Council on 23rd May, 2007.
The financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the functional and presentation currency. Figures and phrases
relating to the previous year have been restated where necessary, to conform to the current year’s presentation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with SLAS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance, the
result of which form the basis of making the judgements. Actual results may differ from estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only for that period, or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
1.3 Assets and the Basis of their Valuation
1.3.1Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation is charges to the Income Statement on the written down
values at the following rates per annum in order to write off the cost of such assets over their estimated useful lives, except in the
case of Buildings on Leasehold Land. Buildings on Leasehold Land have been depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
their estimated useful lives.
Generator 20%
Furniture and Equipment 10%
Air-Conditioning Equipment 20%
Audio-Visual Equipment 10%
Motor Vehicles 20%
Computers 20%
Canteen Equipment 10%
As per SLAS 18 (Revised) - Property, Plant and Equipment, depreciation should commence when an item of Property, Plant and
Equipment is available to use. As the previous policy, depreciation was not charged on assets in the year of purchase whereas a
full year’s depreciation was charged in the year of disposal. In accordance with the new SLAS, additions during the year are
depreciated from the month the asset is available for use and ceases in the month of disposal. The change resulted in an increase
in depreciation charged during the year by Rs. 302,542.
1.3.2Educational Material - IRQUE Project
Library books purchased under the IRQUE project is capitalised and charged to the Income Statement over a period of 3 years.
Work Based Learning Programme being a software purchased from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
(ICAEW) is charged to the Income Statement over a period of 4 years.
Syllabus development cost is capitalised and charged to the Income Statement over a period of 3 years.
1.3.3Inventories
Inventories held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and slow
moving items. Cost is arrived at on a weighted average basis.

1.3.4Receivables
Receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
1.3.5Short-Term Investments
Treasury Bills are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Other short-term investments are valued at the lower of cost or market value.
1.3.6Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits at Bank. Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and
cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows.
1.3.7Cash Flow Statement
Cash Flow Statement has been prepared using the ‘Indirect method’.
1.4 Accounting for Grants
Grants that compensate the institute for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the Income Statement on a systematic basis
in the same period in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Institute for the cost of an asset are recognised
in the Income Statement on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related asset.
1.5 Employee Benefits
1.5.1Provision for Retiring Gratuity
Provision has been made for the retiring gratuity payable from the initial year of service to all employees in conformity with SLAS
16 - Retirement Benefit Costs. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983, the liability to an employee arises
only on completion of 5 years of continued service.
The liability is not externally funded nor is it actuarially valued.
1.5.2Defined Contribution Plans
Obligations for contributions to Provident and Trust Funds are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
1.6 Current Liabilities
1.6.1Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are those, which fall due for payment on demand or within one year from the Balance Sheet date. Non-Current
Liabilities will fall due for payment one year or more after the Balance Sheet date.
1.6.2Taxation
The Institute is exempt from Income Tax under Section 7(b)(ii) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.
1.7 Events occurring after the Balance Sheet date
The materiality of events occuring after the Balance Sheet date has been considered and appropriate adjustments, wherever
necessary, have been made in the accounts.
1.8 Income and Expenditure
1.8.1Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to ICASL and that it can be reliably
measured.

The Report of the Auditor
To the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka
I have examined the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka as at 31st December 2006,
the Balance Sheets of F. B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund and the related Statements of Income, Changes in
Funds and the Cash Flow for the year then ended.
Respective Responsibilities of Management and Auditor
These Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Institute's Management appointed by the Council and have been prepared
and presented in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standerds. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial Statements
based on my audit.
Basis of Opinion
I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free of material misstatements. An autdit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall.
Financial Statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. I have obtained all the
information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of my audit.
Opinion
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, proper books of account have been maintained by the Institute with respect
to its activities, F. B. Lander Prize Fund and the Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund, and to the best of my information and according to
the explanations given to me, the Financial Statements which are in agreement with the books of account read together with the notes referred
to therein, give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Institure, the F. B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril Begbie Memorial Prize Fund
as at 31st December 2006 and of the results of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended.
