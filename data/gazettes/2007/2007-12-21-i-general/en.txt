substantive tests of samples of transactions. The scope and the extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as
wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff, other resources and time available to me. The audit was
carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, methods and practices to obtain reasonable assurance as to
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The audit included. examination of evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting principles and significant estmates and
judgements made in the preparation of financial statements, evaluation of their overall presentation and determining whether
accounting policies adopted were appropriate, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. Sub-sections(3) and (4) of
Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and
extent of the audit.

stated accounting policies as set out in the Notes (from Note No. A to F) to the financial statements and give a true and fair

3.3 Contract Administration :
The following matters were observed.
(a) According to the agreements relating to 36 contracts costing Rs. 94,696,119 on repairs and constructions of buildings of the
University, those works should have been completed between the years 2000 to 2004. Nevertheless, the works had been
abandoned even as at 31 December 2004 without carrying out work costing Rs. 45,124,289. Appropriate steps had not
been taken even during the year 2005 to carry out such works while action had not been taken against the contractors for
the failure to complete the works or defects in the works carried out.
(b)  A physical examination of 06 works relating to the renovation of the lavatory system of the hostels revealed that despite
the payments ranging from 16 per cent to 95 per cent of the contracts amounts being paid, repairs to the drainage system
which formed the basic purpose of repairs, had not been repaired properly.
(c)  According to the agreements relating to 13 works estimated at a cost of Rs. 57,662,341 and commenced during the period
of 31 August 2004 to 28 April 2005 should have been completed on 05th, November, 2005. Nevertheless, the work
certified and paid for in that connection as at that date amounted to Rs. 26,182,612.
(d)  A sum of Rs. 207,147 had been paid without proper authority for work carried out in excess of the estimated quantities
under 05 items in the contract for repairs to 06 lavatories of the Sanghamitta Hall.
(e)  An agreement had been entered into with a contractor on 10th August 2004 for the computerization through software the
bibliographical information in the index cards of the Library Network of the University. The following observations are
made in this connection.
I. The tenderer who quoted the lowest price had not been awarded the tender due to the failure to forward the Bid Bond with
the tender despite satisfying all other conditions. The loss sustained by the University due to the award of the tender to
the second lowest price amounted to Rs. 249,901.
II. The non-inclusion of the editing of the errors in information already available in the software at the time of the award
was questionable. Another party had been deployed outside the tender procedure for editing on the payment of
Rs. 241,523. The basis of that payment was not explained.
III. Attention had not been paid for carrying out the computerization and editing of data through the University Staff and to
obtain the assistance of the Officers/Lecturers of the University having specialized knowledge in Computing.
IV . A sum of Rs. 1,147,541 had been spent on the computerization and editing of data. Nevertheless, the correct information
had not been obtained even up to 14 February, 2006.
3.4 Management Inefficiencies :
The following matters were observed.
(a) Money had been donated to the University by external parties for granting scholarships to students with economic
hardships. The Board of Governors had decided to invest such money and utilize 80 per cent of the interest earned thereon
for such purpose. A proper scheme had not been formulated for the proper implementation of the objective and only 33 per
cent of the interest received in the preceding year had been utilized for that purpose.
(b) Forty four donations amounting to Rs. 11,974,374 made for specific activities had not been utilized for the respective
activities even up to December 2005. In certain instances, such money had been utilized for purposes other than those
specified by the donors.
(c) The following observations were made in connection with the expenditure met out of the Revolving Fund of the Faculty of
Agriculture.
i. Advances amounting to Rs. 320,000 had been granted on 06 occasions up to 24 August 2005 without obtaining estimates
of expenditure. Further, advances had been granted before the settlement of the advances granted previously.
ii. In certain instances, materials required for production puposes had been puchased without following the tender procedure.

PART   I :  SEC .  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 20.12.2007
iii.Even though a standard cost had been computed for yoghurt and meat based foods, which form the main productions
under the Fund, the variance between the actual production and the actual input had not been computed. Even information
needed for such purpose had not been recorded.
(d) Even though 19 lecturers who had proceeded abroad and breached the agreements and bonds had requested the money
recoverable from them to be recovered from the Provident Fund money due to them such amounts had not been recovered
up to date. Steps also had not been taken to institute to legal action to recover the value of bonds amounting to
Rs. 88,028,128 which exceeded the balance lying to their credit in the Provident Fund.
(e) Even though a sum of Rs. 38,555 had been paid in the years 2003 and 2004 for the procurement of periodicals for the
libraries of the University, the periodicals concerned had not been received by the libraries even up to 31 December, 2005.
Action had also not been taken for the recovery of the money.
(f) The procedure specified by the Director General of the Department of Public Enterprises had not been taken to identify the
balances of advances, debtors, creditors and deposits amounting to Rs. 10,106,077 written off from the accounts for the
year under review.
3.5 Identified Losses :
The follwing losses were observed ;
(a)  A compensation of Rs. 25,000 had been paid to a person who applied for the post of Parks Attendant but not recruited,
in accordance with a case filed by him.

despite the order for the same magazines for the years 2004 and 2005 already made by the Librarian of the Faculty of
Engineering.
(c) The recovery of Rs. 7,573,673 on the bonds of 38 Lecturers had been irrecoverable due to misplacing of their files.
3.6 Idle and Underutilized Assets :
The following idle and underutilized assets were observed ;
(a)  Twelve motor vehicles had been lying deteriorating in the University premises exposed to the elements.
(b)  A Jeep provided to the Parks Division and another Jeep of the Department of Soil Science of the Faculty of Agriculture
had been idling since the year 2002 and from December, 2004 to September 2005, respectively.
(c)  A portion of the dental equipment out of those made available as JICA aid in the year 2001 had been lying idel in rooms
without being properly recorded in the registers even up to the end of the year 2005.
(d)  Stocks valued at Rs. 113,898 had been lying unused over several years as at 08 November, 2005.
3.7  Exceptional Items :
The following deficiencies were observed ;
(a)  The legal ownership to the lands at Polgolla, Dodangolla and Mahailuppallama used by the University over a long period,
had not been obtained.
(b)  The engine of the motor vehicle received as foreign aid had been replaced by a diesel engine of another motor vehicle
without the approval of the Board of Governors or the recomendation of a competent officer. Action had also not been
taken to revise the registration of that motor vehicle.

The following observations were made ;

(a)  A sum of Rs. 20,000,000 out of the provisions made for the old Medical Building and a sum of Rs. 4,438,450 out of the
provisions made for buildings, had been transferred to without authority to the Capital Assets Rehabilitation Account and
spent.
(b)  Expenditure amounting to Rs. 280,569,104 had been incurred in excess of the estimated provision made under 23 items of
expenditure, thus indicating that the budget had not been made use of as an effective instrument of management control.

A reconciliation of the cost per student relating to the year under review with that of the preceding year disclosed an
increase of Rs. 34,588.
