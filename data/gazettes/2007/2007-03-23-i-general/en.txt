According to Section 3.1.3 of the Treasury Circular No. 01/2004 dated 24th February 2004, the accounts of the Fund of the
year 2003 should be furnished to the Auditor General  before 15th April 2004. However, the accounts for the year 2003 had
been furnished to audit only on 14th July 2005.
2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
The Following accounting deficiencies  were observed.
(a) A reconciliation of the receipts of compulsory contributions, investments, realization  of investment in the receipts
and payments account with the books and records furnished revealed  overstatements amounting to  Rs.251,747
Rs. 500,251,747 and Rs.500,000,000 respectively. The said  deficiencies had reflected in the cash flow statement too.
(b) The government bonus accumulated accounts and the government bonus accounts receivable  had been overstated by
Rs.377,620 due to overstatement of compulsory contributions as shown above and the computation of government
contributions receivable in proportion to the said value.
(c) Expenditure of the Fund amounting to Rs.238,216 and Rs.3,329,215 respectively  for the year 2003 that should be
credited to the government  revenue had been shown in the balance sheet under current liabilities as audit fees and
establishment and administration expenses payable. Administration expenses amounting to Rs.3,063,162 relating to
the year 2002 had been credited to income on 31st December 2003 and this amount too had not tallied with the
balances of the preceding year. the reasons for this had not been explained.
(d) The balance after setting off erroneous  debits and credits  amounted to an erroneous credit of Rs.2,794,066 as at 01st
January 1990. According to the final accounts presented from 1990 to 2003, a sum of Rs.52,444,446,560 and
Rs. 52,439,028,397 respectively had been shown separately as erroneous debits and credits. A register had not been
maintained on this and an age analysis also had not been furnished to audit. the balances had been shown in the
accounts as erroneous debit balance of Rs.2,624,097 as at 31st December 2003 after setting off erroneous debit and
credit balances.
2.2.3 Rendition of Payment Vouchers
A sum of Rs. 59,524,066 had been paid as refund of contributions of the Public Service Provident Fund from January to
October 2003. Of this payment vouchers relating to Rs. 1,740,809 had not been obtained from the respective institution by
the Public Service Provident Fund Unit even as at 31st May 2004.
2.2.4 Obtaining Debit and Credit Notices
According to Section 04 of the Public Service Provident Fund Circular No. 1/97 dated 31st July 1997 of the Department of
Pensions, the respective institutions should send advices  relating to debits and credits to the Fund each month to the
Secretary to the Fund before the 15th day of the suceeding month. However,  only two institutions had sent these advices

230
for the year under review. Similar to previous years, an efficient and effective action had not been taken even during the year
under review too to obtain these advices.
2.2.5 Payment of Contributions
Instances were observed where contributions had been paid based on recovery records certified and sent at times, whilst the
detailed abatement registers had not been submitted to the Fund.Therefore, the correctness of these payments could not be
satisfied in audit.
2.2.6 Settlement of Erroneous Debit and Credit Balances
It was observed that effective action had not been taken to settle the erroneous debit and credit balances.
2.2.7 Lack of  Evidence for Audit
Although there are about 289 institutions under the Provincial Councils, only 36 files had been furnished  to audit for
examination of contributions received relating  to the year 2003. Records had not been maintained to identify separately the
institutions by names and the number of institutions  that should send the contributions. Files had been maintained only in
respect of the institutions that send the contributions. Therefore, the contributions receivable and the bonus thereon cound
not be ascertained in audit.
2.2.8 Interest Paid in making Payment of Contributions
It was observed at the examination of accounts that there had been delays often in making payment of contributions and
bonus by the institutions under Provincial Councils. But, while making refunds, interest is calculated treating that the
contributions has been received promptly without taking into consideration the actual date of receipt. Therefore, it was
observed that interest are paid out of the Fund for contributions that had not been received.
3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Results
According to the accounts presented, the financial results for the year under review was a surplus of Rs.1,219,923 as compared
withe the corresponding surplus of Rs. 1,454,533 for the preceding year, thus indicating a deterioration in financial results by
Rs.234,610. This had occurred as a result of the erroneous credit of interest income on investments amounting to Rs.10,000,000
made during the preceding year. When this is adjusted the actual financial results for the year will show an improvment by
Rs. 9,765,390.
3.2 Informing the Balances of the Members Accounts to the Contributors
According to Section 25 of the Public Service Provident Fund Act, the Director of Pensions should inform the contributors after the
close of the financial year, the balances of the members accounts prevailed as at 31st December. Although the total number of
members of the Fund as at 31st December   2003, was 166,036, it was itimated to me that balances as at 31st December, 1999 had
been prepared only in respect of 35,000 Reserve Police Officers. Action had not been taken to inform the year end balances to the
members for over 4 years due to non - receipt of abatement registers and non-maintenance of updated accounts separately for each
contributor. In this connection, the Director of Pensions had informed me that there were only a total of 50,000 members as at 31st
December 2003. However, updated registers of members had not been maintained to identify separetely the active members and
in -active members.
3.3 Budgetary Control
The budget for the year 2003 furnished to audit on 12th March 2003 had not been prepared in terms of Paragraph 4 of the Treasury
Circular No. 836 of 16th August 1977.
4. Systems and Controls
Special attention is needed in respect of obtaining abatement registers in time, obtaining contributions, maintenance of registers and books
and records and settlement of erroneous debit and credit balances.

PART   I :  SEC .  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 23.03.2007
Observations of the PSPF Management Board on the Report of the Auditor General on the Accounts of the Public  Service
Provident Fund for the year ended 31.12.2003
2.2.1  Rendition of Accounts
   (a) Agree with the observations.
2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
 (a)Disagree with the observations.
I. Investment of Rs. 251, 747 in Treasury Bills on 04.04.2003 which has been overstated as a payment in the cash book
of the Bank of Ceylon was corrected  in the same month by stating  as a receipt. However, it was rectified in Journal
Record no. 03 of year 2003 by stating as a compulsory receipt of contribution.
ii. The cheque value of Rs.500 million was received to this office on 06.01.2004 having credited (accounted) to the
account 8098 by Deputy Secretary to the Treasury on 31.12.2003.
(c)  Agree with the observations
The amount of Rs.377,620.10 which over-stated has been adjusted by the accounts of year 2004 of Journal No. 1 to the
Accumulated Government Bonus Account and Government Bonus Receivable Account.
(d) Disagree with the observations
i. All expenditure that are audit fees and administration expenditures of the reviewed year are credited to the Government
income on following year. This has been a procedure  practiced for  a period of time.
ii. Expenditure to be debited to Government income for year 2002 should be calculated subsequent to the deduction of
audit fees and depreciations. This  difference has been accourred as a result  of not adding water and  electricity charges
when crediting administrative charges to the Government income. If this was pointed out when auditing accounts of
years 2002 this would have been rectified in year 2003. However all expenses to be credited to Government income
for year 2004 has been credited and corrected.
(e) Disagree with the observations.
All analysis on erroneous credits and debits was forwarded to you when preparing  year 2002 accounts. Though a record on
this regard has not been maintained, all items have been stated accurately in cash book and ledger by monthly. If this has been
pointed out at a previous auditing  (as you have been provided details from 1990 to up to date) a separate report would have
been submitted.
Further, indicating as a total balance in accounts by having set off erroneous credits and debits was a   procedure which
practiced for long period of time. It has been observed as that erroneous credits should be as Rs.2,799,367.65 and  erroenous
debits as Rs. 85,132.91 when re-analizing  the erroneous credits and debits. Action will be taken to submit detailed report in
this regard for your easy references as soon as possible.
2.2.3 Rendition of Paying  V ouchers
Agree with the observations
Arrears vouchers valid of Rs. 747,122.14 have been received. The Institutions which has not sent  vouchers or voucher copies
having issued the awards during 01.01.2003 to 30.04.2003 has been caused to the existence of arrears vouchers. Letters have been
sent to these Institutions to send us true or certified copies of the vouchers which were paid to the Institution. (Copies of the letters
may be submitted if necessary.)
As a solution to these issues step has been taken to make the payments of awards from May 2003 by cheques without sending
awards through these Institutions. Accordingly, issue on arrears vouchers will be resolved in future.

232
A complete explanation in this regard has been provided to the Government Audit Division of this Department at a previous audit
query.
2.2.4 Obtating Credit and Debit Notices
Agree with the observations
We are not in a position to taking actions on Institutions that are not responding to the notices made by circulars and numerous
correspondences stating to send debit notices. (credit notices if only credits) Therefore action has been taken to inform in this regard
by dispatching the officers.
As a solution, it is proposed to inform the officers by the Government Audit Units which undertake  auditing in respective
Institutions. Accordingly all debit notices may be get received.
2.2.5 Payment of Contributions
Disagree with the observations
All payments are made based on the abetment register. No payments are made for Institutions that abetment register has not been
submitted. However, if the contribution was recovered,  payments shall be made by obtaining recovery notes at the time of
payment being paid. (As abetment register send annually)
If we are provided with cases that payment has been made based on the recovery notes without receipt of abetment register we will
be able to overview such incidents. As those cases are causing  problems to you regarding the accuracy of the payments action will
be taken to discontinue these payments.
2.2.6 Settlement of Erroneous Credits and Debits
Disagree with the observations
All Institutions are being informed by correspondences and circulars to send debit notices. please refer the observations in 2.2.4.
2.2.7 Lack of evidence for Audit
Disagree with the observations
No Local Authorities are sending money to the fund. Institutions which send money by cheques to the fund are Provincial Councils
and Projects which cannot be accounted based on the Account Summaries. All files that presently maintained can be furnished for
the auditing. This type of inconveniences  may not be arisen as if the files have been  requested while making the audit queries. As
files on Provincial Councils are necessary  for daily purposes of the Fund it would be convenience  if inspections on files are being
made of not disturbed to the daily routines of the Fund.
Though a single report on all receipts has not maintained, it is need to be informed that separate  files are being maintained for the
receipts of contributions of each Institution in all Provincial Councils. Subject clerks for this purpose have been appointed and
correspondence  is updated by having sent reminders when receipt of contributions is getting delayed.
In terms of the PSPF Act the Government bonus should be sent by the Treasury. Such money is received to us monthly. 12% share
is recovered from Institutions of foreign projects except from the institutions pay salaries by the Consolidated Fund. Amount
collected in 2003 as such is Rs.607,780 . This is 0.25% to total bonus money receipts.
Receipt of bonus money for year 2003 was duly accounted. If there was any uncertainties that should have been pointed out to the
officers concerned while making the audit queries.
Further, please be informed that 12% of all bonus amounts of all projects except of the Treasury  has been recovered and duly
accounted.
2.2.8 Interest for the Payment of Contributions
Disagree with the observations.

Accordingly, interets may not be paid by the fund in respect of the money that has not recived to the fund.
