  Statement of cash flow
  Statement of cash flow has been prepared using the indirect method.
 (i) Impairment
  the carrying amounts of the foundation’s non-financial assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. if any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated.
  An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
impairment losses are recognised in statement of income and expenditure.
 (j) Liabilities and provisions
  Liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position when there is a present obligation as a result of 
past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. 
Obligations payable at the demand of the creditors or within one year of the reporting date are treated as current 
liabilities in the statement of financial position. Liabilities payable after one year from the reporting date are treated 
as non-current liabilities in the statement of financial position.
 
  A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the foundation has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation.

position until such time as they are required.
