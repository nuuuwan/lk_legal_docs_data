 (i) According to the information made available to audit, annual board of survey on library books, valued at  
Rs. 53,184,556, had not been carried out by the management of the university for more than 30 years. 
As a result, the management was unable to identify the losses from non-receiving of library books timely. 
According to the audit tests conducted in 2011 on library books, it was observed a loss of Rs. 1,572,452 and 
however, that loss had not been settled and remained under suspense account.
 (ii) A sum of Rs. 5,480,177 had been paid as overtime to the employees, without confirming their working hours 
through the finger print attendance in accordance with the Establishments Circular No. 10/2017 of 10th july, 
2017 of the university Grants Commission.
  i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial 
Statements Section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.
 1.3 Responsibilities of management and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
 
  Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as management determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
  in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the university’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the university or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
  those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the university’s financial reporting process.
  As per Section 16 (1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the university is required to maintain proper books 
and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to 
be prepared of the university.
 1.4 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also,
  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control.

  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
  Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the university’s ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that a material uncertainty exists, i am 
required to draw attention in my report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
my auditors’ report. However, furture events or conditions may cause the university to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
  i communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that i identify during my audit.

action will take to destroy those inventory items immediately.
 (3) Other Observations
 ( a) As per the Circular the Loans recovery period is five years as sixty installments from the month of Loan 
granted. As a policy, the loan installments are not recovered from the salary of April and December month of 
every year. Only, the interest on the loans are recovered in the months of April and December every year. Due 
to the non-recovery of installments during the months of April and December, the loan recovery period exceeds 
5 years.
  in addition to that certain loans exceeded more than 5 years due to no pay leave, vacation of post, termination 
of service, retirement from the service etc. However, we have a clear control and procedure to recover it from 
the employee uPf when releasing the uPf fund.
 ( b) We have taken a clear mechanism to return the refundable deposit to the respective students immediately. if 
relevant student did not claim the refundable deposit within 5 years from the course completed period, we 
have taken action to transfer it to the university development fund. Vavuniya Campus too has taken action to 
transfer this amount to university development fund.
 ( c) Advances
  following action has been taken to recover the unsettled advances immediately. Moreover, we have already 
strengthen our internal control system to closely monitor unsettled outside advances which are currently under

 ( d) the university of jaffna is receiving funds for various purposes from different well-wishers. When we receive 
the amounts those were credited to the respective ledger accounts and such funds are kept in fixed Deposits 
on short term investment basis. the interest earned from the respective investment is taken into account and 
utilized for the particular purposes indicated by the donors when such event occurs. this fund of Rs. 1,990,474 
was still not used for any specific purpose since the donor did not instruct any special tasks. As soon as we 
receive the instruction form the donor we will take action to use the fund immediately.
 ( e) this was a case filed in District court in 1998 by a former Assistant Registrar against the university for his 
Acting Salary. the judgment for the case has given only on 2017 and, based on the judgment and approval of 
the council the settlement was made for the former Assistant. Registrar in 2018.

in this regard had been prepared codifying all the procedures to scrutinize the legal requirements to minimize 
the obligation in future.
 ( h) Currently university is having only 53 security staffs and out of this 50 staffs are employed in unversity of 
jaffna and the remaining 3 are employed in Kilinochchi premises. this carder capacity of the security staff is 
not enough catering the entire university. therefore, it is being important for the university security staffs to 
work over time. the security staff service is required for all 30 days of the month. ireespective of Saturday, 
Sunday or holiday’s security service is unavoidable and it has to be delivered without any break, resulting in 
increasing the security staff over time payment.
  However, management has already taken action to increase the carder requirement for the university and 
action taken to fill the balance carders immediately.
 ( i) Most of the Exam results have been released based on the recommendation of Pre result Board, and the final 
result will be released along with second semester/yearly basis. Action has been taken to reduce the delays 
in releasing the exam results by sending reminders to the Deans of the faculties and submitting the monthly 
reports on “the status of releasing the results” to the Senate.
 ( j) Control mechanism has been already accelerated to control subsequent journal payments. Action already taken 
to deduct the journal value from the subsequent journal payment if the supplier fails to supply the periodicals 
within the two years’ period. Current outstanding journal issues had been bought down to uSD 9,328.
 ( k) following are the main reasons for the unused hours. However, it was ensured that unused hours did not affect 
the university student’s education and standards of the course.
  Sociology
  the attendance was not taken when conducting field visit to fulfull the practical components of the course 
units. Also while conducting tutorial classes for some courses the attendance were not taken. Some lectures 
were not covered due to the situation in relation on holidays and unexpected students’ unrests. Action will be 
taken to maintain attendance property in future.
  fine Arts
  Some lectures have not been covered due to the situation in relation on holidays and unexpected students’ 
unrests. Some lectures were cancelled due student’s activities and university meetings. Lectures were not 
covered for public holidays.
  Tamil
  Due to lack of staff, unable to cover up lapsed lectures. Some lectures were not covered due to the situation in 
relation on holidays and unexpected  students’ unrests. Some lectures were cancelled due student’s activities 
and university meetings. Lectures were not covered for public holidays.
  Accounting, financial managment, Commerce and human Resource managment 
  the approved calendar of dates usually does not consider special holidays, strikes of students and staffs, 
student’s educational tours & special events organized by students. further if we have consecutive holidays in 
a week students failed to attend the lectures, specially the students who are coming from southern part of the 
Sri Lanka. therefore, we are compelled to cancel the lectures due to poor attendance.

  During the month of the December 2018 there was a natural disaster of the flood in Vanni region and our 
students engaged in relief activities, due to this some of the lecture works were cancelled by students.
  Students conduct the management studies/commerce week (MASCO week). Most of the cultural and sports 
programs were conducted in the evening. Due to these some of the evening lecture were cancelled for one 
week.
  Occasionally the staff has presentation session for students in their respective subjects for 2 to 3 hours 
continously. However, the attendance was signed by the students only for one hour. therefore, this hour was 
not taken in to account.
  However, entire syllabus contents were covered with in the lecture hours conducted and in future we will have 
well defined and proper contingent mechanism to avoid those lapses. Each staff should maintain complete 
records of student’s attendance in the future. Reason for missed lecture hours and alternative arrangements 
to cover missed lecture hours from the forth coming academic year has been already planned well ahead. 
therefore, in future we able to regularize the syllabus and maintain detail records for the lecture program.
 ( l) As maintained the university of jaffna was at the rank 7 in the year 2017 howevr it stepped down to rank 8 
in the year 2018 and again holding the position of 7 in year 2019. the drop of the Ranking in the year 2018 
is mainly due to incomplete uploading or updating the e-repository of the university, which is used in the 
Webometrics to rank the university.
  this matter was discussed at the Senate, Council and the then Vice-chancellor agreed to take initiatives to 
accelerate the uploading of the research papers however the uploading was not completed as expected since all 
the articles were not submitted to the Library in PDf forms.
  this matter was discussed with the Librarian of the university of jaffna and she said that mechanism is 
developed in the Library under section of e-resources to upload all the research articles in the e-repository. An 
Assistant Librarian is now given the task to upload the research papers and a staff is assigned to assist her in 
this task.
  this was already discussed with the Competent Authority and planned to have coordinators in each faculty/
unit to collect all the research articles either abstaracts/full articles and send to the Library every month. this 
process will be monitored by the internal Quality Assurance unit (iQAu) and internal Quality Assurance 
Cells (iQAC) of the faculties and units. further e-repository is now included in the agenda of the iQAu 
monthly meetings and the progress will be reported to the university Community, Senate and Council. further 
respective Deans and Heads of units are also informed to include this as an agenda in their faculty boards/
Board of Management/Department meetings. this will also be monitored by the iQAu monthly through the 
minutes of the faculty board summited to the Senate.
  At last, every step will be taken to update the research articles in to the e-repository to bring the universities 
ranking above.
 ( m) Action would be taken to include the provision of medium of instructions in the Degree statement with the 
approval of he Senate. However, at present, the medium of the instructions is indicated in the Academic 
transcript which is issued to the Graduates at the end of the course. 
 ( n) All payments were made with the recommendation of the university Research Committee (uRC) based on 
the justification given by the grantee. further, uRC has also decided that new applications under university 
Research Grant (uRG) will not be entertained, if final report of the previous grants had not been received. 
Action is also being taken to obtain the final reports of the researchers. the following table shows the current 
position of progress reports and final reports received upto now.

  When uRC approving new grants and payments for prior grants, it is considered the present position of the 
prior grants and the unutilized amount of the particular grantee for the previous year and requested him/her to 
complete the prior research within the stipulated grant period. in addition to the above, uRC has also decided 
to request grantees, to submit the progress report and final reports of the previous grants, before awarding the 
new grant. Reminders for requesting progress reports and final reports are promptly sent. However, there are 
few instances grantees did not comply. Action has been taken to freeze the unutilized amount after the grant

submitted by the researchers.
 2018 Eight nos. of researchers have submitted their final reports, up to now and 13 nos. of researchers have

unversity Grant Commission allocates Research Block Grant, to universities every year to finance their ongoing 
researches and new research projects. At the university level, university Research Committee is monitoring the 
university Research Grants and the research activities under the above grants. for the above monitoring purposes, 
the uRC usually urges the grantees to submit the progress reports and final reports of the research projects, time to 
time, in order to monitor the financial and physical progress/performance of the funds allocated for each and every 
research activities.
further, the uRC at its 34th meeting held on 4th December, 2018 has taken decision to compile the details of research 
outputs (Abstracts, papers, equipment etc) of each grantees at the respective Departments, faculties and Academic 
Affairs and Publication Branch in order to utilize the outputs/benefits of the researches for further continues researches 
and literature survey. furthermore, uRC allocates funds through the programme budget, for presenting papers at 
the National/international conferences and publication purposes in order to utilizing the outcomes or findings of 
the above researches. this will ensure not only efficient and effective utilization of the research funds but also 
utilizing the outcomes/findings of the researches in a manner to achieve desired outcomes towards social economic 
developments.
in the years of 2017 and 2018 more than 60% of final reports or progress reports on researches had not been submitted 
to the university by researches. further, without obtaining the final reports, more than 50% of payments to researches 
had been made by the university in 2017, thus indicated management inefficiency.

Final report of the researches for the year 2017 and 2018 are being submitted now, and this details is being reported 
regularly to the uRC for monitoring purposes. All progress reports, final reports and other related documents are 
available at the Academic Branch for verification, and action is being taken to freeze the unutilized fund, within the 
time frame. furthermore, when granting funds for new applications, it is considered the submission of final report 
of the previous grant by the uRC.
initially, the fund is being released for the purchase of necessary equipment’s and goods, which are essentially 
needed to start the preliminary works and it depends on the type of research. further, the researcher has to disburse 
the fund and complete the research within the budget period, and to follow all financial rules ad regulations and 
purchasing procedures, when they purchase equipment’s and goods for research and it will take much time to 
proceed the precedures for purchase. therefore, on submission of certified bills and other related documents, on the 
recommendation of the uRC, funds are released, in order to avoid considerable delays in payments, and to speed up 
the researches.
 ( o) Most of these Non Academic vacancies are minor grade employees. these vacancies are filled based on the list 
given by the Ministry of Higher Education. Last period there were 2 list received from the ministry and both 
the list were cancelled due to the changes of Ministers.
  Now we have received the new Ministry list and based on that we have planned to fill 210 vacancies which 
was going to be filled within 2 months as the interview date has already been scheduled.
  university has taken all the efforts to fill the existing cadre vacancies promptly. the university was unable to 
fill the 43 positions of Professor Chair except four which are in process as there was no application received 
with required qualifications despite of repeated advertisements. Such situation  is prevailed even for the position 
of Senior Lecturers/Lecturers in some disciplines in all faculties. in such circumstances the university filled 
these vacant positions by temporary Lectures, temporary instructors or by temporary Demonstrators in order 
to carry out the academic programs without interruption.
  We have received the Ministry list to fill the Non Academic minor grade staffs and action already had been 
taken to fill the Non-academic staff in Vavuniya Campus.
  Academic Staffs, we were unable to find suitable candidates with the expected qualifications and experience. in 
such circumstances the Vavuniya Campus has filled these vacant positions by temporary Lectures, temporary 
instructors or by temporary Demonstrators in order to carry out the academic programs without interruption.
 ( p) the following action has been taken to overcome this problem.
  All support staff are requested to balance the inventory register, keep and maintain other relevant document for 
assets moving.
  Remove the auctioned items which were approved by the council before the next Board survey. it will create 
the not verified items or shortage. Action will be taken to remove those items from the list immediately.
 ( q) We have now taken effective action from August 2018 to maintain log books for vehicles properly.
 ( r) Activities of the Career Guidance unit and the Staff Development Centre were not included in the Strategic 
and Annual Action plan of the university in the past. Now activities of the Career Guidance unit and Staff 
Development Center will be included in the Strategic and Annual Action Plan in the future.
 ( s) We have been without the internal Auditor during the last quarter of the year and human resources were 
not sufficient enough to cover all the chapters in the year of 2018. Only from june 2018 onwards the Audit 
Assistants were appointed to internal Audit Division and still Deputy internal Auditor vacant dispute constant 
follow up.

 ( t) this was beyond the control of the university. there had been a system error in the fixed Assets register which 
was introduced in the previous year. the error was unable to be rectified by the system providers for more than 
2 months. Due to this the submission of the financial Statement got delayed. However, we have corrected the 
error successfully and finished the report end of May, 2019 and placed it to the Audit committee. We have taken 
precautions and corrective action to avoid these types of errors in the future and action already had been taken 
to submit the financial Statements on time in the future.
 ( u) the Administration has taken action to have regular monitoring of variances at the finance Committee on 
monthly basis and at Audit Committee on a Quarterly basis. Action has already been taken in this regard and 
all possible precautions are taken to minimize the variances.
