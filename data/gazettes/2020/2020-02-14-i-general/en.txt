Vice-chancellor,

Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements and other Legal and Regulatory Requirements of the 
Eastern university, Sri Lanka for the year ended 31 December 2018 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, 
No. 19 of 2018.
1. financial Statements
 1.1  Qualified Opinion
  thE audit of the financial statements of the Eastern university , Sri Lanka (‘university’) for the year ended 31 
December 2018 comprising the statement of financial positions as at 31 December 2018 and the statement of 
financial performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under my 
direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of 
Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 and finance Act, No. 38 
of 1971. My report to Parliament in pursuance,  of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled 
in due course. 
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my 
report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university 
as at 31 December 2018, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
 ( a) in terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard-07, Land and buildings should be accounted for 
separately, even though when they were acquired together. however, the value of land and buildings of the 
university as at 31 December 2018 amounting to Rs. 2,712,073, 167 had been shown together without showing 
the value of land separately.
 ( b) the maintenance of an institution becomes doubtful without the sufficient assistance of the treasury and the 
Government as the net assets thereof had significantly eroded following the continuous deficit sustained by 
the institution. Adverse General reserve have been observed continuously in the financial statements of the 
university.

 ( c) Eleven numbers of Lands, total extent of 210.3 hectares and buildings there of belongs to the university had not 
been valued and brought to the financial Statements.
