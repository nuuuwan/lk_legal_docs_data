the estimated useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment items from the date that they were made

        Description          Estimated useful life period
 Buildings                                                20 years
 Water treatment plant 20 years

Depreciation is provided in full in the year of purchase and no depreciation is charged in the year of disposal. this method 
of depreciation is adopted in using the rates in the uGC circular 649 from the financial year 2006 and hope to continue 
in future. Also this method of calculation of depreciation was approved by our Council at its 117th meeting held on 
20.01.2007. 
this method has not applied in the year 2018 for the commencement the faculty of technology & faculty of Medicine. 
We received grants from Ministry of Higher Education and the university Grant Commission as mention in the Note 
No. 1.3.3. the assets which we purchased and constructed and received under these grants are not depreciated and not 
amortised in the year 2018 since the faculty takes their first intake in January 2019.
the insurance receivable for SGKE 9206 motor car received full in 2017.
in 2018 the water treatment plant, land & Building located at Pambahinna junction acquired by the water Supply and 
Drainage Board without any consideration to the university. the net book value of those assets as at 01.01.2018 is as 
follows.

the land received in 2006 as a grant. Hence, this land value reduced from the land grant and the disposal 
loss of the building Rs. 315,000.00 charged to the statement of financial performances in 2018.
e)  Capital Works in Progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. these are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the 
construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-in-progress would be 
transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is available for use i.e., 
when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended 
by the university.
1.2.2 Intangible Assets
 An intangible asset is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the 
expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the university.
 
 intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. following initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increase the future economic 
benefits embodied in the assets. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
 All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life and amortized using straight line method to 
write down the cost of intangible asset to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows.
a. Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight-line basis.
b. Cost of development of new curriculum is amortised over a period of 5 years on Straight-line basis from 
the effective date of the new curriculum.
 intangible assets represent the software purchased under the HEtC grant on their written down value and 
software purchased by the entity. 
   
1.2.3  Curriculum Revision
the university revises the curriculum for all degree programs in every five years and amendments are not 
making within that period. Hence, the expenditure incurred on capital funds are amortize over the five years 
period on the basis that the economic benefits would flow to the university during the effective period of 
the new syllabus .Since the faculty of Management Studies and faculty of Geomatics have implemented 
the revised curriculum w.e.f. 2015, the expenditure incurred on that are amortizes w.e.f. 2015. Also since 
the faculty of Agricultural Sciences and the faculty of Applied Sciences have implemented the revised 
curriculum w.e.f. 2016, the expenditure incurred on that are amortizes w.e.f. 2016. further the university 
will start to amortise the expenditure incurred for faculty of technology once the courses of technology 
faculty started.
1.2.4	 knowledge Enhancement  
the expenditure incurred to enhance the knowledge of the employees is treated as capital expenditure and 
amortize over 5 year period.
