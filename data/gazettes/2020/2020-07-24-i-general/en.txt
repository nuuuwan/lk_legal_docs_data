Director,

statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, 
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under 
my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of 
Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 and finance Act, No. 38 of 
1971. My report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due 
course. 
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my report, 
the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university as at 31st 
December 2018, and of its financial performance and its cash flows or the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion

financial position as at 31st December, 2018 and cash out flow from investing activities for the PPE of the cash 
flow statment for the year ended 31st December, 2018, revealed a difference of Rs. 13,000.
 ( b) Lack of Evidence for Audit

 Item of Accounts Value evidence not made available
  Rs.
Building and improvement 530,139,729 
furniture fittings and Office Equipment 62,094,152  Register of fixed Assets, Detailed Schedules and 
Machinery 31,850,145 Report of the Board of Survey
Sports Goods 1,876,481

 i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements section of 
my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
qualified opinion.
 1.3 Responsibilities of management and those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.07.2020
635
  in preparing the financial statements,  management is responsible for assessing the university ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing. as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intend to liquidate the university or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  
those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the university financial reporting process. 
  As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the university is required to maintain proper books 
and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to 
be prepared of the university. 
 1.4  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain rensonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also:
 * identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
 * Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal 
control.
 
 * Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management. 
 * Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the university ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that a material uncertainty exists, i am 
required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the university to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
 * Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
  i communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that l identify during my audit.
2. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
  National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 includes specific provisions for following requirements.
 • Except for the eflect of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, 1 have obtained all the 
information and explanation that required for the audit and as far as appears from my examination, proper accounting

contribution to the national economy too. it was observed that 46 Academic staff are eligible to do research and

mainly attributed to the inverse effect on improvement of education and economic.
