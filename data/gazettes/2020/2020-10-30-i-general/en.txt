 2. basis for Opinion
  We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs).
  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Organization in accordance with the ethical 
requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
 3. Responsibilities of Council's and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
  The Council is responsible for the preparation of Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Statement of Recommended Practice for Not-for-Profit Organisation, and for such internal control as Council 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
  in preparing the Financial Statements, Council is responsible for assessing the Organization's ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless Council either intends to liquidate the Organization or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
  Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the institution's financial reporting process.
 4. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is an assurance of high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
  A further description of the Auditor’s responsibility for the audit of Financial Statements is located at Sri Lanka 
Accounting and Auditing website at: www.slaasc.com/auditingstandards/auditorsresponsibility. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.

of 2000. We have obtained all the information and explanations that we required for the audit and as far as appears
