location.
(ii)  in case of any doubt regarding your entry for a paper or eligibility 
to sit a paper you should bring it to the notice of the Supervisor and get 
your doubts cleared. Failure to do so may result in your candidature for the 
subject being cancelled.

to be cancelled. in case a candidate forgets to bring such documents into

question leave one or several blank lines. do not crowd in your work. 
 (vii)  the left-hand margin of the answer sheet is set apart for you to enter 
the number of the question you answer. the right hand margin is reserved

calculations and any roughwork, in their serial order as part of the working

accurate and sufficiently large. In an  answer running into serveral pages if

a peon or an attendant.

invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise your 
hand.
