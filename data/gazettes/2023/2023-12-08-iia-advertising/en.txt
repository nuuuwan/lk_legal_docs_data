location.

your doubts cleared. failure to do so may result in your candidature for the 
subject being cancelled.

question leave one or several blank lines. do not crowd in your work. 
 (vii)  the left-hand margin of the answer sheet is set apart for you to enter

invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise your 
hand.
