University of Jaffna Council approval this Land has been given to Provincial Department of Agriculture of 
the Northern Province on long term lease of 30 years free of charge from 2018 to establish the traditional and 
nutritive food preparation and sales centre call “Ammachchi” in order to develop the traditional food habit 
among the University students and community.
 3.9 adaption of Revaluation policy for Property, Plant and Equipment
  It was highlighted that University of Jaffna has not carried out any revaluation for its property plant and 
equipment after 2014. The fact remains that, 
  01. - The fair value of the assets differs from the carrying value of the assets
  02. - The review of useful life of the assets is not carried out as per the standard
  03. - Fully depreciated assets are being used by the University continuously than useful life.
  Also it has been pointed out that there are assets which have been fully depreciated and showing with zero 
value in the books of account without any revaluation. The University of Jaffna has done one-time revaluation 
of its assets in 2014 in order to computerise its fixed assets register. This revaluation exercise has costed more 
than 5 million and taken more than 3 years to complete. Since we have charged depreciation on straight line 
method as per the UGC circular without reviewing the useful life annually, some assets ended up with zero 
value.
  As a large Government institution University of Jaffna has 10 categories of assets and 2.5 million individual 
items in those categories. The expenditure and time associate to determine the fair value and regular review 
of useful life of large value assets are exorbitantly high and not practical. Also, revaluation of these assets 
will not bring any significant impact on the financial statement of the University. However, the General 
Audit has highlighted this matter in the report as noncompliance with SLPSAS. Therefore, this matter has 
been discussed in detail at the Audit Committee taking into account of cost and benefit in purview of Auditor 
General and suggested the following adoptions.
  As per the University of Jaffna at its 472nd Council meeting held on 31st December, 2022, approved the 
revaluation policy for the property plant and equipment as follows.
 01.  Consider carrying value of the assets as at 31st December, 2022 as deemed cost and depreciate them on 
reducing balance method except for “0” value assets adopting the cost method.
 02. “0” value assets to be revalued at nominal value to be recommended by Council appointed revaluation 
committee and depreciate them too at the reducing balance method.
  The adoption of the above policy with adequate disclosure resolve the revaluation problems of the 
property plant and equipment of the University of Jaffna. The above policy document has been sent to

My no. : nPCG/jf/D/uoj/1/2022  31st May, 2023.
Vice Chancellor,
University of Jaffna.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements and Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements of the University 
of Jaffna for the year ended 31st December, 2022 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. 
 1. financial statements
   1.1  Qualified Opinion
    The audit of the financial statement of the University of Jaffna “University” for the year ended 31st 
December, 2022 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2022 and the 
statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year 
then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accouting policies, 
was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the 
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act, 
No. 19 of 2018 and Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. My report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in 
Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course.
    In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of 
my report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
University as at 31st December, 2022, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then 
ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
   1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
 (a) Donations amounted to Rs. 1,280,240 received during the year under review had not been identified 
and measured in the financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting 
Standard II.
 (b) The useful life time of the non-current assets should be reviewed annually in terms of Paragraph 65 
of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standared 07. However the Property, Plant and Equipment 
amounting Rs. 48,516,123 which had been fully depreciated but still being used by the end of the year 
under reveiw, had not been reviewed and action had not been taken to revise the said estimated error 
in the financial statements in terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 03.
 (c) The income amounting to Rs. 2,374,180 received by auctioning the Fixed Assets in the year under 
review had been identified as an income without adjusting through an Assets Disposal Account in 
terms of Paragraph 80 and 81 of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 7. Moreover, action 
had not been taken to remove the cost and the accumulated depreciation of the auctioned assets.
  I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements  Section of my report. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.
   1.3   other information included in the university’s 2021 annual Report
    The other information comprise the information included in the University’s 2022 Annual Report but does 
not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon, which I have obtained prior to the 
date of this auditor’s report. Management is responsi ble for the other information.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.09.2023
2111
    My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
    In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsiblity is to read the other information 
identified above and in doing so, consider whether the othre information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
  
    If based on the work I have performed on the other information that I have obtained prior to the date of this 
auditor.s report, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to 
report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.
   1.4  Responsiblities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the financial statements
    Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as 
management determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
    In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the University’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the University or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
    Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.
    As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the University is required to maintain 
proper books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic 
financial statements to be prepared of the University.  
   1.5  auditor.s Responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
    My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements.
    As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also, 
 
² Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a materila misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
 
² Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the University’s internal control.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 22.09.2023
2112
² Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
² Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the University’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists. I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor.s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the University to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
² Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 
² I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my 
audit.

observation of the Governing authority in respect of the issues highlighted in the report.
 1. financial statements
 
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
 (a)  As per the SLPSAS 07, an asset is recognized in the financial statements when it is probable that the 
future economic benefits associated with the assets will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. The Ammachi food preparation and sales center had been designed by the team 
headed by Provincial Director and Deputy director of Department of Irrigation of the Northern Province 
and the project was implemented by District Secretariat office of the Kilinochchi. Finally the building 
was handed over to operate according to the Ammachi concept by the Department of Agriculture, 
Northern Province to Faculty of Engineering. Those assets will be used to prepare and sell the foods by 
the staff employed in the Ammachi by the Department of Agriculture, Northern Province. The donations 
of those assets were placed in the finance committee and action has been taken to add these assets as 
soon as the building has been taken to the donation in the University books of accounts.
 (b)  This matter was discussed in detail at the Audit Committee meetings held on 25th April, 2022 and 15th 
July, 2022. The audit committee noted the following matters relating to the property plant and equipment 
of the University of Jaffna.
 1- University of Jaffna has 10 categories of assets and more than 2.5 million individual assets items 
under these categories.
 2- The University has carried out one-time revaluation for the first time in 2014 by a firm of Chartered 
Accountants for the purpose of computerization of fixed assets register at a cost of over five million 
taking more than five years to update the fixed assets register.
 3-  Reviewing the useful life of the assets, residual value annually and revaluating the assets for every 
three or five years for the purpose of depreciation will not be practical as it is a time consuming 
and costly exercise. Also, this exercise is not expected to bring significant impact on the financial 
statements of the University of Jaffna.
  Considering the above aspect, audit committee at its 70th meeting held on 22nd April, 2022 and 
special audit committee meeting held on 25th April, 2022 recommended to the council to changes 
the policy to adopt the cost model taking into account of the book value as deemed cost and to 
depreciate the assets using reducing balance method with the approval of the UGC and the CASL. 
Accordingly, the council approved has been obtained for this change at the 472nd meeting held on 
31st December, 2022 and forwarded to UGC for the approval to implement the policy form 01st 
January, 2023 onwards.
  University of Jaffna is waiting for the approval from UGC to implement the policy for property plant 
and equipment. The action will be taken as stated in the policy one the approval received from UCG. 
The policy note is attached as a attachment in the annexure.
 (c) The whole sales proceeds received in the action has been considered as surplus and recognized as 
income in the financial statements as the carrying value of the disposed assets are zero and are fully 
depreciated. The disposed assets are being derecognized from the asset register and remove it from the 
system once the council approval received.
 2.  Report on other Legal and Regulatory 
  Requirements Reference to Rules and Regulation
  (a) financial Regulation of the Democratic socialist Republic of sri Lanka
 i-  All the advances have been made as per the financial regulations 371 (2)(b), public administration 
Circular No. 3/2015 and UGC Circular No. 05/2015. Due to the Economic cirsis and fuel problem 
most of the institution had shut down their operations continuously. University of Jaffna also

2115
completely closed for certain period continously for one to one and half months. Due to this most 
of the officers who were taken the advances for certain purposes were unable to commence and 
complete their program as they planned. Due to this the advance settlements had been delayed. 
However, we have ensured that all advances taken during the period of 2022 had been settled 
2022 itself.
  Also, we have taken proper control mechanism to monitor the advances and ensure the settlement 
of the advances as soon as the event is completed. Strict action has been taken and internal 
circulars had been issued to all the staff to educate them to settle their advances on time.
 ii.  All the advances have been made according to the financial regulations 371(2)(b), public 
administrative Circular No. 3/2015 and UGC Circular No. 05/2015. All the advances had been 
made with the maximum limit of Rs. 100,000.00 Cheque and there were no breach of the circulars 
under any circumstances. However action already taken from 01.05.2023 to stop facilities for 
staff grade officers.
 (b)  section 03 (X) national Budget Circular no. 03/2022
  According to the 3rd paragraph of National Budget Circular No. 03/2022 in relation to the above matter, 
controlling expenditure should be followed when incurring expenditure and implementing the projects 
that using domestic funds, it was requested to suspend the loan facilities granted to the staff grade 
officers under Public Officers Advance Accounts until the end of the year. The loan disbursements 
given by the University to the officers mentioned are the disbursements made from the capital amount 
recovered while recovering the installment capital of the loans already given to the employess and the 
University has not used any treasury funds for this loan disbursement from 01.05.2022 to 31.12.2022. 
Therefore, it clear that the said distress loan payment was done entirely through the internal funds of 
the University and the University did not use the treasury funds for this payment in any case and the 
National Budget circular 03/2022 was not violated in any case.
 (c)  section 3 of Chapter XX of the Establishment Code of the university Grants Commission and 
higher Educational institutions.
 (i) This matter has been repeatedly explained in our previous replies. Academic staff in the Sri Lankan 
University systems do not generally sign in the Attendance Register and this matter was satisfactorily 
explained at COPE meeting held on 11.11.2017. However, the heads of the departments monitor them 
and confirm their presence.
 (ii) Due to Corona outbreak and Economic crises the finger print scan was not used. However, attendance 
registers had been properly maintained and certification was done based on such records and overtime 
& Holiday payments have been made according to the certified and authorized attendance register.
 (d)  Circular no. 15/2015 on 17th november, 2015 of university Grants Commission Establishment.
  We have taken very strict follow up action on the release of results. Monthly reports regarding release of 
examination results with the details of examinations, date of examinations held, details of subjects for 
which results not released and period of delay are submitted to the Senate. In addition, Internal Circular 
issued by the Competent Authority on 04.03.2020 and reported to Council indicating the procedures, 
guidelines and rules to expedite the process of releasing results. Action had been taken to closely monitor 
this process and there has been a significant improvement on releasing the results in comparison with 
previous year. Timeline for releasing the results have been included in the Examination by laws which 
are to be approved by the Council.
 3. other Matters
 (a) Whenever staff is getting retired the outstanding loan amount will be recovered from their UPF balance. 
However below shown staffs have failed to submit their UPF request forms. However, they have 
sufficient UPF balance in their account. Soon after we received their UPF request action will be taken 
to recover loan amount. University is taken possible action to contact these staffs and get their UPF 
request.
