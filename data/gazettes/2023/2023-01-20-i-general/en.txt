university, Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December, 2021 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of

financial performance, statement of changes in net  assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under my 
direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of 
Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sub-section 107(5) and Section 108 of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and 
provisions of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. My comments and observations which i consider should be 
published with the Annual Report of the university in terms of Section 108 (1) of the university Act, appear in this 
report. My report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in 
due course.
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my 
report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university as 
at 31st December, 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 ( a)  According to the paragraph 99 of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 1, all income should be 
included in the surplus or deficit, but the interest income from short term investment of Rs. 24,700,208 earned 
during the year under review had been credited to the restricted fund without recognizing as revenue. As a 
result, the deficit for the year under review and restricted fund had been overstated by that similar amount in 
the financial statements.
 ( b) the cost of other assets of Rs. 105,634,056 had been shown under property plant and equipment without 
grouping of assets of a similar nature or function in an entity’s operations according to Paragraph 50 of the Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 7.
 ( c) the useful lifetime of fixed assets had not been reviewed annually in terms of paragraph 65 of the Sri Lanka 
Public Sector Accounting Standard 7. Property, Plant and Equipment costing Rs. 609,026,512 had been fully 
depreciated but still being used by the end of the year under review. No action had been taken to rectify the 
above estimated error in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 3.
 ( d) Capital grants received for the acquisition of non-current assets from treasury during the period from 1986 to 
2017 had not been amortized. furthermore, capital grants of Rs. 1,087,500,000 received for the acquisition of 
non-current assets from treasury during the period from 2018 to 2021 had not been recognized as revenue in 
terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 11.
 ( e) A sports goods depreciation policy had not been identified and the sports goods in the university’s main 
center and trincomalee campus had been depreciated by 10 percent and 20 percent respectively. therefore, the 
accuracy of the accumulated depreciation of the sport goods amounting to Rs. 16,159,548 could not be verified 
satisfactorily.
 ( f) the land around 241.2 hectares at 15 locations of the university had not been valued and brought to the 
accounts.
 ( g) Even though, 275 items of Non-Current Assets costing of Rs. 23,055,912 had been handed over to the 
university by Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development Project during the period from 
2019 to 2021, value of those assets had not been brought to the accounts based on the instruction given by that 
project.
 ( h) the Pathology Laboratory constructed in 2008 at a cost of Rs. 3,666,316 had been depreciated by Rs. 280,116 
instead of Rs. 2,566,312 by 31st December, 2021. As a result, the accumulated depreciation had been understand 
by Rs. 2,286,196 in the financial statements.

88
 ( i) Bond violations aggregating to Rs. 34,042,950 due from 09 lecturers who currently serve at the university had 
not been brought to the accounts as receivable. As a result, the current assets and the bond obligation reserve 
had been understated by that similar amount in the financial statements.
 ( j) the gratuity of Rs. 23,334,060 paid during the year under reveiw had been debited to the gratuity expenditure 
account instead of debiting the provision for gratuity account. As a result, the deficit for the year under review 
and the provision for gratuity account had been overstated by that similar amount in the financial statements.
 ( k) three storied building complex for English Language teaching unit had been completed at a cost of  
Rs. 224,269,514 and handed over to the university on 27th August, 2020, but it had not been capitalized even 
by 31st December, 2021. As a result, the accumulaed depreciation as at 31st December, 2021 and the deficit for 
the year under review had been understated by Rs. 14,913,923 and Rs. 11,213,476 respectively.
 ( l) Direct debits in 03 bank accounts aggregating Rs. 4,060,132 had been shown as unidentified debits in the bank 
reconciliation without being identified as expenditure since 12 years.
  i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements 
Section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for my qualified opinion.
