Contingent Liabilities
Actions (Case No. DMR-05959/09 and DmR-0572/08) were filed in the District Court to recover monies, being the value 
of the bonds executed in favour of the university by former teachers who had violated the terms of the agreement entered 
into by them with the university.
the Council decided at its 415th meeting held on 10.06.2014 to accept the proposed settlement of Dr. D.P.W. Jayawardene 
on payment of the Rs.1,000,000/- out of Rs.1,113,600/- which was due in case No. DMR 05959/09.
the amount of Rs. 322,289.72 out of the Rs. 900,377.39 was paid on 26.12.2013 and balance of Rs.578,087.97 is to be 
recovered from the university provident fund as a matter of settlement. Accordingly the steps are being taken to recover 
the same.
Actions (Case No. 1538/L and 1225/L) were filed by third parties against the university claiming ownership to the lands, 
belonging to the university and the said actions are pending. As it is uncertain with regard to payment of compensation, the 
liability, if any, for the university cannot be decided reliably.
