vice Chancellor,
university of Jaffna.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements of the university of Jaffna for the year ended 
31st December, 2016  in terms of Section 108 (1) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
thE audit of financial Statements of the university of Jaffna (“the university”)for the year ended 31st December, 2016 
comprising the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2016 and the statement of financial performance, 
statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 
(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 107 (5) of the 
universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the Annual 
Report of the university in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act, appear in this report. A detailed report in 
terms of Sub-section 108(ii) of the universities Act was issued to the vice Chancellor of the university on 14th July, 2017.
 1:2 m anagement’s Responsibility for the financial Statements :
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
 1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility :
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Standards of Supreme Audit institutions 
(iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
  And audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. 
  i  believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion :
  
 
 My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. financial Statements :
 2:1 Qualified Opinion :
  i n my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university of Jaffna as at 31st December, 2016 and its financial 
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting 
Standards.

had resulted in a deficit of Rs. 197,158,693 as compared with the corresponding deficit of Rs. 141,526,367 for the 
preceding year, thus indicating a further deterioration of 55,632,326 in the financial results. Significant increases in 
personal emoluments, maintenance expenses, contractual services and other operating expenses as compared with 
the previous year was the main reason attributed for this deterioration.
  Even though the operations of the university during the year under review had resulted in a deficit of  
Rs. 197,158,693, the value addition of the university for the year under review after taking into account the personal 
emoluments, taxes paid to the Government and depreciation was Rs. 1,846,352,464. further, value addition for the 
year under review had increased by Rs. 342,592,161 or 23 per cent as compared with previous year.

rectified and improved. in this report the actions taken and by the Audit Committee which meets regularly measures 
introduced to improve the financial management are given.
 2.2.1 Comply with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards (SLPSAS)

exercise and a huge task. Despite, several attempts made by the administration. this matters remain since it is a 
huge task. however, the Audit Committee, finance Committee and Council are very much concerned about the 
situation. Action has already been initiated to deploy some rational methods of verification with help of computer 
data base system. A report will be submitted within a year on the progress made in building a comprehensive asset 
maintenance system of Library.

 * Advance are outstanding in respect of Books and Periodicals on account of various reasons such as delay in 
publications, late printing periodicals, delay in transit, abandonment of publications etc. this has been a common 
problem to all university. however, this is being followed and appropriate measures taken to receive them though

of Departments for their observation and necessary action. further, the shortages and losses are to be rectified 
while implementing the project for the preparation of fixed Asset Register.
 (b)  t he situation has now been improved. fuel test for all vehicles has already been done as per the requirement 
and reports are available.
3. financial Review
 
 3.1 f inancial Results
  
 
 t he deviation pointed out in the financial operation given the current system and context of operations are reasonable 
and it is mainly due to increase in depreciation and amortization for which no budgetary allocation are made.
4. Operating Review
 4.1 Performance
  t he observation of the audit in the paragraph has been duly notified to the Council and Senate. Effective measures are 
being contemplated in order to improve the situation.
 4.2 Operating Weaknesses
 4.2.1 Library Administration
  t o the value of uS $ 1,922 settled during the period and action for non-issued periodicals by the supplier will be taken 
to claim the subscription. this issues are common to all Libraries due to late publications. the matter was discussed 
in the Audit Committee Meeting. the direction was given to the Librarian to monitor the issue and bring the notice to 
the Library Committee.
 4.3 m anagement Weaknesses
 (a) Settlement of the bond obligation had been in a very bad situation during the past. On the direction of the 
Council various measures have been introduced to improve the situation such as appointing the Committee 
on obligations of Bond and Agreements. As a result, the number defaulters and amount outstanding has been 
reduced to a great extent. At present only 74 numbers of obligators have to settle the total outstanding amount 
of bond obligation amounting to Rs. 71 million. 
the meeting of Committee on obligations of Bond and 
Agreements is continously reviewing them. A policy paper in this regard had been drafted codifying all the 
procedures to scrutinize the legal requirements to minimize the obligation in future.
 (b) t his service contract had been deviated as additional features were considered and incorporated into the scope 
of work based on the request of the university. further Establishment of new faculties and changes in the 
locations of the Departments and faculty too have changed the requirements. this took extra period of time 
for the exercise and the volume of work to be carried out has tremendously increased.

2638
  Based on the justification given by the contrator, the contract period has been extended from time to time. the 
progress meeting is conducted continually twice a month to review the progress. the process of preparing the 
computerized fixed Asset Register is nearing completion. Since the contract period was extended no penalty 
closed was imposed.
 (c) i tems required for maintenance were purchased during the war situation a bulk due to the difficulty in the 
transport prevailed at that time. Some of these items now have been obsolete. Action is being taken to explore 
the possibility for using the material in alternate ways or dispose them on auction. System is now placed to 
prevent imprudent procurements.
 (d) t he several attempts made to furnish the contact details of the student who are passed out from the university. 
Action has been taken for the students to furnish the Bank Account to deposit the cheque in future.
 (e) Preventive measures have already been adopted in this connection. the control on release of advance up to 
75% of the estimated value related to goods, works and services. unsettled advances were discussed at the 
Audit Committee meetings and finance Committee meetings. the advance form was modified by including 
remedial action for those who have failed to settle in due course with approval of the Council based on the

 4.5 u nresolved matters pointed out in the previous Audit Reports
 (a) Most of the staffs have been using the finger Scanner to report their arrival and departure. But we noted some 
of staffs are recording their attendance manually in the Attendance Register instead of using finger Scanner. 
therefore, the circular will be sent to all the staff to follow the procedure on recording their arrival and 
departure through finger Scanner as per the circulars and Directive of COPE.
 (b) t he Council at its 418th Meeting held on 27.05.2017 decided to surcharge the value of the lost item from the 
officer in charge at the time of loss.
 (c) Preliminary investigation report had been submitted to the Council and the technical information regarding the

 4.7.1 Idle Assets
 (a) At present, the action had been taken to use the building Block “C” by conducting lectures related to the 
Department of Education as per the time Schedule in order to overcome from the non-availability of lecture 
rooms to the Department of Education in stipulated lecture time.
  h owever, it is noted that the construction of other 2 buildings are going on the same and limited premises. it is 
difficult to provide the fulltime access to students. further, the movement of students within the premises will also  
be on risk. therefore, the action is being taken to use the building time to time for purpose teaching.
 (b) i tems were purchased during the war situation a bulk due to the difficulty in the transport prevailed at that time. 
Some of these items now have been obsolete. Action is being taken to explore the possibility for using the 
material in alternate ways or dispose them on auction. And also, the new orders represented current requirements 
according to the purchase requisition.
