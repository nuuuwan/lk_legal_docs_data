the Vice Chancellor,
university of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements of the university of Colombo for the year ended 31st 
December, 2016 in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
the audit of financial statements of the university of Colombo for the year ended 31st December, 2016 comprising the 
statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2016 and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes 
in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution 
of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 13 (1) of the finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 
and Sub-section 107 (5) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should 
be published with the Annual Report of the university in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act appear in this 
report.
 
 1.2 Management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error.
 1.3 Auditor’s Responsibility
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Auditing Standards of Supreme Audit 
institutions (iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.

  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgments, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of financial statements. Section 111 of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 gives discretionary 
powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
  i believe that the  audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. financial Statements
2.1 Qualified Opinion
in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university of Colombo as at 31st December, 2016 and 
its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector 
Accounting Standards.
2.2 Comments on financial Statements
2.2.1 Consolidated financial Statements
 A limited by Guarantee Company named Colombo Science and technology Cell had been registered 
under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 in the year 2013 on the recommendation of the university 
Grants Commission and the Minister of Higher Education without the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers 
contrary to the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.
 As 09 Lecturers including the Dean of the faculty of Science of the university of Colombo holds the 
membership of the Board of Directors of this Company Limited, it was evident that the Subsidy Company 
is under complete control of the university. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Colombo Science 
and technology Cell Company should be consolidated with the financial statements of the university of 
Colombo and presented to the Auditor General. Nevertheless, the Consolidated financial Statements for 
the year ended 31st December, 2016 had not been presented.
 the Head Office of this Company had been housed in a building belonging to the faculty of Science of the 
university of Colombo and the other physical and human resources including computer and accessories 
of the university had been utilized, whereas an agreement had not been entered into on the utilization of 
the property of the university. A sum of Rs. 191,839 only had been paid to the university in lieu of the 
utilization of the resources of the university during the year under review.
2.2.2 Lack of Evidence for Audit
 the title Deeds for the confirmation of legal ownership of lands valued at Rs. 35,296,230,000 shown in 
the statement of financial position had not been obtained even by the end of the year under review and the 
Vice Chancellor had informed me on 17th August, 2017 that the process of transfers was in progress.
2.3  Accounts Receivable
 the following observation s are made.

3.1 financial Results
 According to the financial statements presented, the financial result for the year under review had resulted in a 
surplus of Rs. 176,157,091 as compared with the corresponding surplus of Rs. 326,038,151 for the preceding 
year, thus indicting a deterioration of Rs. 149,881,060 in the financial results during the year under review as 
compared with the preceding year. Although the Government Grants had increased by Rs. 338,034,192, the 
increase in the expenditure on employees remuneration by Rs. 444,958,302 and other overhead expenditure by 
Rs. 343,767,748 had been the main reason for the above deterioration.
 According to an analysis of the financial results for the year under review and the 4 preceding years, the 
surplus had increased from the year 2012 up to the year 2016 with fluctuations. However, when taking into 
consideration the employees’ remuneration, tax paid to the Government and the depreciation for the non-current 
assets adjusted again, the contribution of the university had continuously increased from the year 2012 up to  
Rs. 2,968,791,856 by the year 2016.

conduct of public workshops, publication of books by the academic staff, proceeding abroad by the academic  
staff of the university under Exchange Programmes, presentation of Research Papers by the Post Graduates 
students and representation in international competitions by students had been at a weak level representing 
a range between 8 per cent and 50 per cent. Attention was needed further in respect of the steady progress of

respectively. thus, the number of students enrolled in excess during the 03 years had been 377. the number 
of students to be enrolled for the university had been decided several years ago and failure to pay attention 
to revise that number in timely manner by the Management had been the main reason for this situation.

experience of providing security for universities should be completed, 03 bids out of the bids received 
had been rejected. the second lowest bid of Rs. 41,288,400 included therein was rejected and thus, the 
contract for procurement had to be awarded to the institution which submitted the fifth lowest bid of  
Rs. 44,454,896. As such, a sum of Rs. 7,332,992 had to be overpaid for the period from March, 2016 up

of Section 5.4.8 of the Procurement Guidelines should be recovered by the university before the expiry, 
action had not been taken to recover it.

of remaining work valued at Rs. 11,197,072 by following the procurement process, the remaining 
construction work of 5 storeys had been assigned separately to 5 contractors registered in the institution
