2. Council’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
the Council is responsible for the preparation of these financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Statement of recommended Practice for Not-for-Profit Organisations (SLSORP-NOPS). this responsibility 
includes: designing, implementing and maintaining of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of 
financial statments that are applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable 
in the circumstances.
3. Scope of Audit and basis of Opinion
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accor-
dance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance whether the financial statments are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An 
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by Council, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for 
the purposes of our audit. We therefore, believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
4. Opinion
in our opinion, the Council has maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st March, 2018 and the financial 
statments give a true and fair view of the institute’s state of affairs as at 31st March, 2018 and its financial performance and 
changes in the fund balance for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Statement of recommended Practice for 
Not-for-Profit organisations (SLSORP-NOPS).
