TO ThE bOARD Of  mANAGEmENT Of   S W R D  bANDARANAIkE  NATIONAL  mEmORIAL  fOuNDATION
Report on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the S W R D Bandaranaike National Memorial 
foundation (“the foundation”), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016, and the 
statements of income and expenditure, changes in funds and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s responsibility for the financial statements
the Board of management (“the Board”) is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give 
a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (“SLfRS for 
SMEs”), and for such internal control as the Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. the procedures selected depend on auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Board, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion.
Opinion
in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the foundation as at 31 
December 2016, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the period then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Accounting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (“SLfRS for SMEs”).
