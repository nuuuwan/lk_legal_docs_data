1.2 Management’ s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error.
1.3 Auditor’ s Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgements, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant
to the institution’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the institution’s internal control. An
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the
Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and the extent of the audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit opini on.
1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
My Opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. Financial statements
2.1 Qualified Opinion
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements give a  true
and fair view of the financial position of the University of Colombo School of Computing as at 31st December, 2011 and its
financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.
2.2 Comments and Financial Statements
The financial statement of the University of Colombo School of Computing affiliated to the University of Colombo for the year
under review had been presented for audit on 28th February, 2012. The draft report was furnished on 06th June, 2012 after carrying
out the audit of the accounts. Accounting deficiencies amounting to Rs. 49,129,601 were pointed out in the draft report and the
amended financial statements prepared by rectifying all those accounting deficiencies had been presented on 06th June, 2012. The
possibility of such further deficiencies outside the sample selected cannot be ruled out in audit.
2.2.1 Sri Lanka Accounting Standards
According to Sri Lanka Accounting Standard 18 (14) if the useful life of fully depreciated assets further exists, such assets should
be revalued. Nevertheless, the fully depreciated Motor Van costing Rs. 2,775,000 had not been so revalued.
2.2.2 Non- compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions
Reference to Laws, Rules, Regulations Non-compliance
and Management Decisions

3. Financial Review –
3.1 Financial Results :
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the institution for the year ended 31st December, 2011, before
taking in to account in Government Grant for recurrent expenditure, had resulted in a deficit of Rs. 9,569,004 as compared with the
corresponding deficit of Rs. 23,870,170 for the preceding year. The deficit for the year under review had been converted to a
surplus of Rs. 73,533,724 due to the Government Grant of Rs. 83,102,728 received for recurrent expenditure and the deficit for the
preceding year had been converted to a surplus of Rs. 41,511,405 due to the Government Grant of Rs. 65,381,575 received for the
recurrent expenditure of that year. The increase of Rs. 17,721,153 in the Government Grant for recurrent expenditure had specially
affected the improvement of Rs. 32,022,319 in the year under review.
4. Operating Review –
Underutilizations of Funds :

exceeding three years.

6. System and Controls –

University of Colombo–School of Computing
UCSC COMMENTS ON AUDITOR GENERAL’S REPORT — 2011
2.2 Comments on Financial Statement :
Auditors pointed out that certain account balances contained accounting deficiencies that had not been properly reconciled with
ledger accounts.
2.2.1 Sri Lanka Accounting Standard :
Instead of revaluating each asset with useful life according to SLAS 18, the entire class of such asset had been fully deprecia ted.
However, even if we revalue these assets, the only result is increase the reserve and compared with the cost involved in this process
there is not much benefit for the institute.
2.2.2 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions :
(a) As per F. R. 756 a physical verification started in 2011, but it was incomplete. However a fresh verification started in 2012
it is being carried out;
(b) Loans obtained by the officers not reporting to work could not be recovered. However action has been taken to recover these
loans from their UPF balances;
(c) Other than the EPF loans the distress loan is the only loan scheme available for University employees. According to the
Government Circular, up to a maximum of Rs. 250,000 is granted from treasury funds while the balance amount is granted
from generated funds. On granting the approval from generated funds the views of the Board of Management having
considered the activities carried by the UCSC was that as a motivation factor it is necessary to retain these experts and
professionals within the UCSC and to continue to provide the full loan amount;
(d) Administration and financial activities of foreign funded Research Project is carried out by the permanent staff members.
They ary paid a monthly allowance at very cost effective manner on approval of the Board of Management. If these
activities were carried out by employees recruited from outside the cost would have been very much higher.
2.2.3 Transaction not supported by Adequate Authority :
2nd and 3rd language proficiency allowance paid in accordance with the Establishment Circular No. 06/2003 issued by the
University Grant Commission.
4. Under Utilization of Funds –
Action has already been taken to utilize balance unspent IT grant in 2012.
5. Tabling Annual Reports –
Audited Financial Statement and Auditor General’s report are main documents in the Annual report. Since these documents were
not ready at that time a draft annual report could not be submitted with these documents. However, subsequently on 13.07.2012
we submitted the same to the Auditor General.
6. System and Controls –
Special attention will be given to the sections mentioned.
Thank for your Audit queries.
