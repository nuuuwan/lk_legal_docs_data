The Vice Chancellor,
University of Jaffna.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Jaffna for the Year ended 31st December, 2011 in
terms of Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.
The audit of Financial Statements of the University of Jaffna for the year ended 31st December, 2011 comprising the balance sheet

summary of significant accounting policies and other eplanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions
in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sections 108 (1) and 111
of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Sub sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. My comments

1:3 Auditor’ s Responsibility :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with
Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to  the
University’s preparaton and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to desing audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the
Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit opinion.

2.2.5 We have noted and we will comply in future :
3.1.2 cating a further deterioration of Rs. 222,636,014 in the operating financial results of the University.
(a) Due to prevailing normalcy in the area, the academic and administrative activities of the University have expanded and increased
providing latest communication facilities which cause for this increase in the usage. Due to the development activities, widening
of road network caused frequent disconnection of power supply during the whole office hours leads to the compulsory usage of
direct lines.
(b) University has received three vehicles (two van & one pick up) under the Finance leasing method and these vehicles are used for
the long distance journey and officers are invited for the several meetings frequently to Colombo and it is essential to use hired
vehicles as the existing vehicles are needed for the local travelling.
(c) It is to be pointed out that electricity charges for the nine months aggregating to Rs. 26,253.26 has an average monthly sum o f
Rs. 2,917.029 and the average charge for this should have been much lower than this if the first three months are not taken into
account During April in 2011 Building Engineers and workers who work under SIDA project for the IT network project stayed
there and finalized all the work. University has signed the agreement with SIDA in which it was agreed to provide accommodation
and electricity and other amenities free for those who were engaged by way of SIDA agreement to facilitate completion of the said
project. They used electrical equipment during the stay and it was the reason for the higher electricity charges during that period.
Further, CEB has reported connection wire malfunctions during the period in the line supplying electricity to the said building and
losses have been reported to be occurred to faulty earthling in the surroundings. This fact could be verified from the CEB as it has
rectified it later after informing the University. Only the basic electrical maintenance charges are to be expected from the Guest
House and no special/extraneous expenses were related to it. The Registrar by virtue of his post is entitled for quarters and was
accommodated in the above said premises with the approval of the Vice Chancellor.
(d) We experience difficulties in finding accommodation for guests who come for visiting lecturers/selection board etc. The Guest
House with good facilities is a long felt need. The facilities such as AC, toilets etc. in the Guest House are not adequate and
satisfactory for the many guests who come on our request to attend important meetings and official functions. They specially
insisted on the above facilities and therefore lodging had to be obtained outside.
3.1.3 We are in the process of outsourcing these activities.
3.1.4
(a) The excess money in the current account has been invested in fixed deposit with the permission of the Council. The excess funds
exposed due to under ependiture of capital projects approved and also suddenly release of funds for new projects. Every effort
is made to encash and utilizes this money including running self financing courses.
(b) Whatever interest earned from investment out of the endowment fund or similar donation would be utilized for the intended
purpose of the donor.
3.1.5(i) & (ii) With the commencement of the Faculty of Agriculture at Kilinochchi, the Land master is being used. Other vehicles are
used by the University. The items in the stores are being classified into serviceable and obsolete items. Action is being
taken in the year 2013 for all obsolete items.
(iii) Already finger scanner machines were installed and in use according to the latest Circular. Time recording machine will be
taken as condemned and unserviceable items.
(iv) Some beds have been already issued to the newly rented houses. The balance will be transferred to the hostel of
Agriculture and Engineering which are needful to accommodate the newcomers.
(v) With the commencement of the E-lab of the Faculty of Commerce and Management Studies, computers are being used.
All these are coming under the Faculty of Commerce and Management Studies.
3.1.6

advertisement for our faculty will help to run this programme with additional work which involves additional payment. All
SME’s and experts are members of the Faculty. The observation of the audit has no relevance in this matter.
The Board of study for BBM Online degree programme decided the payment formula based on the other Universities like
University of Peradeniya for the BBM Online degree programme. The Finance Committee and the Council give the final approval
for the budget submitted by the Board of study of the BBM online degree programme with the said provisions.
i. It is not mandatory that one lecturer should be appointed to one subject; all depends on the quality and relevancy of the
lecturer considering qualification and experience.
ii. There is no subject as Principles of Economics in our Curriculum for first year second semester. Mr. S. Ramesh appointed
as SME and Mr. B. Pragalathan appointed as reviewer for the subject BBM 1201 Economics for Enterprises in the first
year second semester.
iii. It is expected that a standard on par with our internal degree programmes should be maintained. The lecturers involve in
the internal degree programmes will maintain the same standard for the BBM Online degree programme.
3.2.5
i. University has followed proper system and necessary format according to the Procurement Manual. Action will be taken
to follow the Procurement Manual properly in future. Due to the non-availability of Ministry nominee to the Procurement
Committee during non-office hours, we are compelled to have the meetings during office hours. Further payments have
not been claimed by the members.
ii. Valuation report was not obtained at that time. The lease has been terminated on 28.02.2013. The lapse is noted and it will
not be repeated.

of the Public Enterprise Circular No. PED/12 of 02nd June, 2003. It will be reviewed periodically. Action Plan for 2013 is being
prepared now.
4.3 The subject of ( a), (b), (c), (d) have been included in the Internal Audit Programme and plan for the year 2013. The subjects such
as capital work projects and contract administration, procurements, loans and advances had been included in the Internal Audit
Programme and Plan - 2011 and had been done the audit works.
 In the past years, the Internal Audit Unit was unable to observe the activities of Vavuniya Campus of University of Jaffna due
to following reasons.
* Shortage of staff.
*No appointment for the head of Internal Audit Division for a long time. Only the division was run by two Senior Staff Assistants.
*Difficulties in travelling due to prevailing situation at that time such as War and Exodus.
4.4 Most of the audit queries have been replied except two. Every effort is made to finalize a reply for those two queries, fail ing an
interim reply will be given.
4.5 Separate accounts are being maintained for income and expenditure in the ledgers for extension programmes and shown in the trial
balance also separately and furnished to audit.
4.6 The Annual Reports 2011 had been submitted to the Ministry of Higher Education excluding Auditor General’s report on the Final
Accounts 2011.
4.7 The University has adhered to the UGC guidelines. V ariations have been informed to the Faculties to take action to minimize.
5.0 Proper systems and controls are there in design. Heads of Divisions have been reminded of the requirement to strictly follow the
control systems by monitoring the performance of staff. These details are dealt in the induction programme for the probationary
