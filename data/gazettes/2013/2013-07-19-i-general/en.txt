2. Council’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
Council is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards applicable for SME’s. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant  to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that the free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
3. In common with many organizations of similar size and organization, the Institute’s system of control is dependent upon the
close involvement of the Council Members. Therefore, where independent confirmation on the completeness of accounting was not available,
we have accepted assurances from the Council Members that all the Institute’s transactions have been reflected in the books of accounts.
4. Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. These Standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurances whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit

the overall financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes
of our audit.
We, therefore, believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
5. Opinion :
In our opinion, so far as  appears from our examination, the Institute maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st
March, 2013, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Institute as at 31st March, 2013, and its
financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards applicable for SME’s.
