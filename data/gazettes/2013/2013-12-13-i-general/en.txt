My No. : PY/F/PSPF/2011/2012/04. 06th July, 2012.
The Director General of Pensions,

December, 2011
THE audit of financial statements of the Public Service Provident Fund for the year ended 31st December, 2011 comprising the balance sheet

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 13.12.2013
An audit involves procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgements, including the assessment of risks of material misstatements of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Fund’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made by managment, as well as evaluating
the overall presentaion of financial statements.
I believe that audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.
1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
My opinon is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Qualified Opinion
In my opinion except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements give a true and
fair view of the financial position of the Public Service Provident Fund as at 31st December, 2011 and its financial performance and
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements
2:2:1 Accounting Deficiencies
(a) According to the provisions in Section 7 (1) of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance, a sum equivalent to 1.5 times of
the Compulsory Contribution should be credited to the Fund by the Government as the Government Bonus. Even though the
sum of Rs. 17,571,473,225 equivalent to the 1.5 times of the compulsory contribution balance amounting to Rs. 11,714,315,483
as at 31st December, 2011 should be available with Fund as the Government bonus that balance amounted to Rs. 17,888,009,781.
As such the Government Bonus Account had been overstated by a sum of Rs. 316,536,556.
(b) The sum of Rs. 39,780,214 shown in the books of the Fund as at the beginning of the year under review as prepayments to the
Consolidated Fund, had been shown in the balance sheet as current assets without being adjusted to the payments made to the
Consolidated Fund in the year under review. As such Government bonus had been understated by that amount while the
appropriation of profits to the Government Bonus Account in the year under review had been understated by a sum of
Rs. 303,324
2:2:2 Suspense Accounts
The balance of the Suspense Account shown as the Adjustment Account in the balance sheet as at the end of the year under
review amounted to Rs. 18,326,537. This balance brought forward over a long period had not been settled even by 30th April,
2012.
2:2:3 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
The Following non-compliances were observed.

and a deterioration of a Rs. 167,281,910 was indicated. The decrease of the interest income by a sum of Rs. 165,647,939 or 6.4 per
cent due to the decrease of the rate of interest in the year under review as compared with preceding year had been the main reason for
the decrease is the surplus.

(b) According to the Management Analysis of the Fund appearing in the financial statements furnished to audit for the year under review
the maintenance of the accounts in a manner to enable the balances as at the end of the year to be furnished to the contributors had been
shown as one of the 04 main activities directed towards the objectives of the Fund. Nevertheless, the individual Accounts had not been
maintained in the updated manner to enable the individual account balances as at end of the year to be informed to the contributors.
4:2 Interest Percentage Entitlement to Members

Nevertheless there was not appreciable change in the cadre available for carrying out the functions of the Fund and as such the number
of members attended to by each officer had increased. The position relating to the year under review and preceding 08 years is given
below.

According to Circular No. 1/97/of 31st July, 1997 and No. 14/2006 of 30th October, 2006 of the Director General of Pensions, an
advice on the money credited to the Fund in each month, should be furnished to the Secretary of the Fund by the institutions
concerned before 15th day of the month following. Nevertheless, a few institutions only had furnished the advices. The progress of
the procedure of the Fund to get down the advices had not reached the expected level.
5. Systems and Controls
Deficiencies in system and controls observed during course of audit were brought to the notice of the Director General of Pensions
from time to time. Special attention is needed in respect of the following arrears of control:-
(a) Accounting;
(b) Member’s Contributions;
(c) Follow up action on Audit Observations.

AMARAWEERA,
Auditor General.
Observations of the Management Board of Public Service Provident Fund regarding the report of the Auditor General concerning
the accounts of Public Service Provident Fund for the year ending 31.12.2011.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2:2:1 Accounting Deficiencies
(a) This surplus remained for a long period and generally an amount equal to 15 times of the compulsory contribution should be
credited to the government bonus money. Reason for this surplus had been the delay of applying for the awards by members
after the termination of membership. However, since these awards are made only to the date on which the membership
terminated, the balance money usually remained in the account. Since the interests received by re-investing these money is also
credited to the government bonus caused to the increase of this surplus. Further the money remained in the account of
membership terminated persons is also invested until they receive the awards. The interest received by these investments is
also credited to the member’s accounts which caused to the surplus.
(b) The difference can be corrected by adjusting with the Treasury books and these adjustments have been done by the monthly
account summary of month of February, 2012. The transfer sheets are forwarded herewith.
2:2:2 Receivable and payable accounts
(a) Even though the Departments and Ministries that maintained erroneous debits for over 5 years are regularly notified in written
and by telephone to settle the balance, those institutions have not taken any positive action to settle the same. Therefore it has
been difficult to settle these balances. However the action has been taken to correct most erroneous debits of year 2010 and
2011 within the year concerned.
No unsettled erroneous debits for year 2008, 2009, 2010 are available and it was already informed the authorities by letters and
telephone to settle the erroneous debits remained for over 4 years. It is regret to inform that these institutions have been
abstained from providing past information.

2:2:3 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
(A) Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance (Ordinance 621)
(i) (2) Section (2) 2
It has been difficult to make immediate corrections to these errors due to unavailability of proper maintenance of single
accounts from the beginning of the fund. However the steps have been taken to maintain single accounts under the
e-pensions project. Therefore it is believed that these matters would be settled under the e-pensions project since the
financial provisions have not allocated to any other programme.
(ii) Section 25
We are hopeful that this issue will be solved as the facility to inform balances to the members is available under the
e-pension project which already completed the pilot program.
3. II (3) (b)
Agree. Noted to follow this during the forthcoming financial year.
(B) Para. 04.03 (e) of Public Finance Circular PF/423 dated 22nd December, 2006 relevant letter is attached herewith.
The Treasury has not issued a separated letter noticing to inform the balances but when inquired the Treasury we have not
received any reply in that regard. The quarterly submitted reconciliation report has been submitted on 05.04.2012 and it is

4.1 Interest percentage of the members
As a result of decline of interest rates (Year 2011), the appropriated interest percentage also have been dropped-down.
4.2 The lost interest revenue of the Fund
Letters have been sent to the Secretary to the Treasury informing the decrease in appropriated interest percentage due to irregularity
of receiving imprest for Government bonus and to settle the account balance of the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury and a discussion
in this regard also have been held with the patronage of Director General of Treasury Operations. This was informed also to the
Secretary to the Finance Ministry by letter dated 16.03.2009 but the money not received yet. However this situation can still
prevailed due to not receipt of money to settle the account balance of Deputy Secretary to the Treasury.
4.3 Staff resource
Comparing to previous years we were able to reduce the delays by 62% as a result of recruitment of additional 08 officers and utility
of existing resources with maximum efficiency.
4.4 Benefit payments for members
A considerable number of increases in the applications to draw benefits could observe during Year 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 though
there was no increase in the number of staff comparing the workload ultimately caused to delay in the process. To overcome this

difficulty and expedite the payments, we introduced a special project by attaching 8 officers temporarily. Accordingly we were able
to reduce the 39.9% unpaid applications of year 2009 up to 15.3%.
4.5 Performance
(a) Though we expected 8000 registrations in the fund, the membership enrolment could be done on the basis of receipt of
applications only. Therefore it is difficult to achieve the expected targets as the membership registrations done on the basis of
applications received.
The success of collecting contributions has been 74% only and the irregularity of receiving government bonus has been caused
to this. The additional fund investment has been 101.4% and it is a reach to the expected targets. The benefit payments to the
contributors have been dramatically increased as 262.8% due to payment of benefits to the reserve police officers and other P.
S. P. F. benefitted officers since they were received permanent posts on government policy decisions. The expected target of
issuing awards has been increased as a result of the method used to expedite the award payments.
(b) We believe that the already initiated e-pension project would make solutions for these issues.
4.6 Management weaknesses
Even though the all departments and ministries were educated to submit credit notices by the circular 14/2006 dated 30.10.2006
in addition to the circular 1/97, the institutions concerned have maintained a procedure of sending a list with cheques or different
manner without sending credit notices. As a result of these irresponsive conducts of the institutions, the fund could not meet with
the expected targets of its productive implements. Having identified these issues the Public Service Provident Fund has introduced
an instruction manual along with Circular 04/2010 dated 25.05.2010 and it is expected the fund would be achieved the progress
predicted. As the success of all these actions depends on the reactions of other instituions it has been difficult to achieve t he
expected goals at some times.
