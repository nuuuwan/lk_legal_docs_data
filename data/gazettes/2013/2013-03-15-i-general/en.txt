PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 15.03.2013
18 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, Sections 108 (1) and 111 of the Universities Act and Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13
of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. This report is issued in terms of Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act and Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance
Act, No. 38 of 1971. My comments and observations appear in this report.
1:2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;
selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable  in the circumstances.
1.3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff,
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain reasonable
assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination on a test basis
of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessments of accounting Policies used and significant
estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall presentation. I have
obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of my
audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance
Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that the University of Colombo School of Computing had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st December,
2010 and except for the effects on the financial statements of  matters referred to in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the University
of Colombo School of Computing as at 31st December, 2010 and the financial results of its operation and  cash flows for the year then
ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2.2.1 Presentation of Financial Statements :
An observation report including the matters revealed at the audit test check carried out on the financial statments presented was
forwarded to the Director of the Institution. The relevant corrections and explanations had been submitted to audit.

Although educational allowances should not be taken into consideration in the computation of gratuity to the educational staff
recruited to the service after 01st April, 2005 in accordance with the University Grants Commission Circular No. UGC/HR/3/
9/8 dated 21st April, 2005, a sum of Rs. 25,729 had been excessively allocated due to the educational allowances paid to seven
members of the staff during the year under review had been taken into consideration in the computation of gratuity.
2.2.3 Accounts Receivable and Payable :
The following observations are made.

(b) On the instruction given by the coordinator (a senior lecturer) of both LTRL and PAN project had transferred the deficit of
Rs. 527,845 to PAN project.
2.2.5 Non compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions
(a) We have already vacated from female hostel at Borella. The rental agreement period of Kirilapona hostel were amended for
three (3) years.
(b)
Lecturer Appoint on Appoint on Date of
Department for Casual Basis Temporary PhD
H. D. R. N. Dayarathna 03.02.2003 19.09.2003 20.08.2004
M. C. Jayawardena 01.11.2002 01.07.2003 20.08.2004
Sida Phd programme had allocated funds for this programme. If these two students were not participated for the programme
the said two PhD opportunity could have been lost to the country. Also they have already finished their degrees and attached
to the permanent teaching staff these two lecturers had served for the University for several years under various capacities
on casual basis.
(c) Dr. Ajanatha Atukorala had been selected as Sri Lanka representative to be participated to the 29th APAN conference. The
total cost of the tour was born by the SIDA programme. When calling quotation from three air lines including people’s travels
the Jetwing Travel had quoted at Rs. 93,000 which is Rs. 16,750 less than the quoted by People’s travels. Hence we purchased
air ticket from Jetwing Travels at a lowest price.
(d) We have already submitted the approval received from Ministry of Finance on investments with a detail reply to the Audit.
Further more details are mentioned below.
Year Amount Invested Date of approval
Received from Ministry
2004 Rs. 41.69m 10.05.2004
2006 Rs. 58.4m 22.06.2006
USD 0.2m
2010 Rs. 20.3 Approval requested
Interest income of Rs. 106.85m earned from the year 2004 had been included in the said investment.
(e) The same MSc degree in Computer Science is being conducted by other universities and private institutions in the country.
Demand for the degree is always depends on the quality of the course work and the lectureres. The lecturers for the programme
is recruited internally as well as externally.
Accepting of appointments by the lecturers depends on the rate offered for an hour. Since the degree programme is being
conducted at the weekends by the all places lecturers are preferred to joined the places where they are offered a higher rates.
In deciding per hour rate all the activities such as preparation of notes, Printing of notes, and all other Primary  activities have
been considered and included. But all other places are paying separately for various other activities.
In addition to that, out of total income earned in this programme, 60% is being used for conducting the degree programme and
the balance 40% is being used for the benefit of undergraduate education, development activities of the institution, and research
activities of the senior academic staff. Also its worthwhile to mention that this is a grate chance for the Govt. to minimize
the cost of undergraduate education.
If it is necessary to comply with the circular instructions it would cause to drop the demand for the degree leading to conduct
it successfully and could be a lost for the institution as well as the Govt.
(f) Presently Treasury Representative is being participated to the Audit Committee meetings regularly.

2.2.6 Transactions of the Contentious Nature
As per the circular instructions given by the University Grant Commission allowance for the proficiency in Second and Third
Language has been paid.
3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Review
3.1.1 Financial Result
Financial result mentioned in the report is correct as per our Financial Reports.
3.2 Operating Review
3.2.1 Performance
(a) Recruitment of 230 students to the Undergraduate programme and offering of degrees to 229 students is correct.
(b) Registration of 6,366 students to the External Degree programme and offering 361,199 and 140 of Diploma, Higher
Diploma and Degrees respectively is correct.
(c) Providing of educational facilities for 443 students for 3 Postgraduate courses is correct.
(d) Delivering of lectures by 17 permanent staff and Visiting lecturers is correct.
3.2.2 Budgetary Control
Capital Expenditure during the year was higher than the budgeted since the UCSC carried out substantial renovation programme
to all of UCSC building to commemorate the 25th Anniversary. However capital expenditure during the year has been managed
well.
3.2.3 Management Inefficiencies
In order to carry out renovation programme to commemorate the 25th Anniversary the UCSC buildings renovation programme
were carried out with the approval of the Board of Management of UCSC to be spent from generated funds.
A consultancy service was obtained with the approval of Board of Management on very feverable terms.
Since the consultant had been providing services to the institution from years ago, the knowledge of the consultant on structure
of the buildings was very useful for this renovation.
It is worthy to mentioned that the said renovation job had been completed successfully even less than the estimated cost.
3.2.3 Uneconomic Transactions
Since resources available to the Internal Audit branch of University of Colombo they say that it is impossible for them to provide
internal audit services to the UCSC. When we explore the actual situation we got to know that they did not cover entire activites
of the institutions attach to the University of Colombo in their internal audit plan.
Having  deeply considered the above fact we decided to employ a professional audit firm in order to carry out UCSC internal
audit activities with the approval of Board of Management to be paid them from our generated funds.
An internal audit plan has been developed by the internal auditors for the UCSC having taken into consideration of University
of Colombo internal audit plan and Audit committee chaired by a chartered Accountant (Board Member) reviewed the plan and
recommended it for the Board of Management for approval.
Since the internal audit is being carried out on a quarterly basis and UCSC audit committee reviews the internal audit report on
a quarterly basis, our finance, administration and other sections are being run smoothly and with high internal control systems.
