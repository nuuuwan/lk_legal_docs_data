NATIONAL  INSTITUTE  OF  LIBRARY  AND  INFORMATION  SCIENCES  (NILIS)
 UNIVERSITY  OF  COLOMBO
ANNUAL  REPORT - 2011
Vision
TO be a centre of excellence of international repute, building synergies between knowledge, education, research and entrepreneurship in
library and information management with a special focus on school librarianship.
Mission
Producing the necessary human resources in information management who can play a pivotal role in the national development in all sectors
with highest competency and integrity and uncompromising quality.
Director’s Review
Brief Introduction : National Institute of Library and Information Sciences (NILIS) of University of Colombo was established in
1999. The purpose of the institute is to provide postgraduate and general training facilities in the Library and Information Sc ience
(LIS) field with special attention to School/Teacher Librarianship. The NILIS was a part of the World Bank funded General
Education Project to improve the school libraries and the quality of the general education in the country. 4,000 school librari es were
established under the project and the main objective of the institute is to provide training and higher educational facilities for the
teacher librarians who were entrusted with the school library work. NILIS introduced a range of Masters, Postgraduate Diploma,
Diploma and Certificate programmes for the benefit of the Teacher Librarians with the help of both local and international expe rts.
In addition a number of postgraduate programmes and Diploma/Certificate programmes were launched for the librarians of the othe r
sectors as well. This is the second higher educational institute serving the Library and Information Science (LIS) field in add ition to
the Department of Library Studies of University of Kelaniya. Sudden collapse of the school library project of the Ministry of
Education around 2005 due to non recognition of the qualifications of the Teacher Librarians for their career improvements has put
NILIS in a very difficult situation. As a result NILIS lost about 70% of its intended clients in the last few years. NILIS has been
struggling to come out of this situation during the last few years. The steps taken and strategies adopted as remedial measures  will
be discussed under the future plans.
Achievements: NILIS over the last decade trained a large number of senior, para-professional, and support staff of the Library and
Information field. As indicated, most of the library trainees were teacher librarians from the Ministries of Education of the C entral
Government and Provincial Councils and the rest were the librarians of the other sectors; e.g. University, Research, Local Gove rnment,
Departmental, NGOs/INGOs. In addition NILIS has been conducting training programmes for provincial/district/zonal level library
administrators, School Principals and for other similar categories both at NILIS and provincial training centres. At the same t ime it
conducts short term training programmes to improve the information literacy, ICT/Digital literacy among public/private sector
administrators, mid-level officials, writers, publishers, librarians and others who are keen to acquire the new skills.
NILIS also publishes its own e-journals in the LIS field which has been hailed as one of the leading e-journals in Sri Lanka as  well as
in the SAARC region. Its Annual Research Symposium attracts both national and international attention. As described later NILIS
is actively engaged in revising and improving its syllabuses and also introducing new market oriented programmes, deviating fro m
the traditional library and information science field. In 2011 NILIS conducted 05 Postgraduate Programmes, namely MPhil/PhD,
Masters in Library Science, Masters in Teacher Librarianship, Postgraduate Diploma Teacher Librarianship and Postgraduate
Diploma in Library and Information Sciences. In addition 03 Diploma Programmes – Diploma in Library and Information Management,
Diploma in School Librarianship and Diploma in Public Librarianship were conducted.
04 Certificate Programmes in Information Management, Public Librarianship and School Librarianship were also offered during the
period. 18 Seminars/Workshops were conducted in Colombo as well as at the provincial level. Annual NILIS Research Symposium
was held. Development of new market oriented programmes, syllabus revision and upgrading of the present programmes have also
been carried out.
Failure and Justification : The major failure of the last few years including 2011 is the unsuccessful attempts to rectify the
problems of School Library field and regain the lost clientele from the School Library sector. As mentioned earlier due to the non-
recognition of NILIS qualifications for the career advancement of the teacher librarians and also the failure of the MoE to inc orporate
the teacher librarians professional qualifications in the Teacher Services Minutes, both the School Library Development Project  and
Revenue and Expenditure Returns

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 08.03.2013
the progress of the NILIS have been halted in the midway. NILIS has been doing its part of work to rectify the situation by
submitting Cabinet Memorandums, engage in advocacy work with the Ministry of Education and getting the support of the National
Library and Documentation Board, Sri Lanka Library Association, UGC and others for its cause. This was the biggest single cause
for slow progress of NILIS in the recent past. The low budgetary provisions for the library sector from the central government,
provincial council and local authorities also affected NILIS training programme in the past decade due to the economic difficul ties.
This prevented the prospective students enrolling at the NILIS from those sectors. The situation is gradually improving
now.
Future Plan: NILIS has been developing its future plan taking in to consideration the School Library problem, new demands from
the clients/market, new innovation in the ICT field and new delivery methods. The NILIS strategy in formulating future plans is  as
follows:
1) Solve the Teacher Librarians problem with the help of MoE;
2) Commence new market oriented courses and reduce overly dependence on the Teacher Librarians;
3) Introduce Undergraduate Programmes in addition to the present Postgraduate/Diploma Courses;
4) Introduce web based distant teaching/learning to attract more students.
1) Solve the Teacher Librarians Problem : NILIS has been having dialogues with the Hon.Ministers of Education (MoE),
Secretaries and other senior officials of the MoE on the Teacher Librarians issue in the past several years. When the recogniti ons of
the Teacher Librarians qualifications for their promotions etc. surfaced in 2006, we persuaded the Hon. Minister of Education t o
submit a Cabinet Paper and rectify the matter. When the Cabinet Paper was submitted in 2006, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed
a committee comprising the senior officials of the General Treasury, Ministry of Public Administration and Ministry of Educatio n
to study and report. This committee met several times and submitted a report recommending the recognition of the professional
qualifications of Teacher Librarians to have a quality school library services in the country. The MoE kept the report more tha n two
years and then submitted it to the Cabinet in 2009. After studying the committee report the Cabinet of Ministers in August 2009
approved the recognition of the professional qualifications of the teacher librarians for their promotions etc. and send it bac k to the
MoE for implementation. Now it is more than 3 years, MoE still has not implemented it. The NILIS, Sri Lanka Library Association ,
National Library and Documentation Services Board (NLDSB) and the UGC continuously made representations to the MoE on the
issue. Regular changes of the Ministers and Secretaries of the Ministry have not helped the cause. In addition the Sri Lanka Li brary
Association and the Teacher Librarians Union charged that a senior officer in the Ministry deliberately sabotaging the project.
On the 05th November 2012 Hon. Minister of Education summoned a special meeting to discuss the Teacher Librarians issue. New
Secretary/Education, senior officers of the MoE and Director/NILIS attended the meeting. The Minister severely reprimanded the
officers who are responsible for the long delay in implementing the Cabinet decision. He instructed them to expedite the matter  and
settle it once and for all. The Secretary/MoE, Mr. Gotabaya Jayaratne, said that he is convinced that there is no other way tha n
going forward with the teacher librarians to have a quality school library service. He assured the Hon. Minister that he will d eal with
the remaining issues and solve the teacher librarians problem as early as possible.
2) Commence New Market Oriented Courses: In the mean time NILIS has started looking at alternative avenues to fill the void
created by absence of the Teacher Librarians. Early decision was taken not to pursue additional Library Science Courses, but to
introduce market oriented, attractive new courses in Information Science field. NILIS has aleady designed/developed two new
postgraduate courses namely a) Postgraduate Diploma in Information Management (PGDIM) and b) Masters in Information
Management (MIM). The Course Formulating Committee chaired by the Director, studied similar courses offered in the universities
in other parts of the world in developing the course module and also studied the requirements in the public and private sector
organizations in Sri Lanka. These two courses and respective syllabuses have been approved by the NILIS Academic Committee
and the BoM and the Senate of the University of Colombo. We are planning to advertise the courses soon. One year Masters
programme in Library and Information Science is also being developed at present. In addition NILIS has improved the syllabuses of
other postgraduate programmes by introducing more information/ICT oriented modules. Another new strategy is to expand the
admission requirements for the postgraduate courses and include a number of relevant other professional qualification; e.g. Associateship
of Sri Lanka Library Association. A number of short courses have also been introduced with the objective of improving ICT/digit al
literacy of writers, administrative officers, clerical grade officials and mid level library staff etc.
3) Introduction of Undergraduate Programme: NILIS is planning to introduce Undergraduate Programme in Information Management
in the year 2013. The NILIS Academic Committee and BoM approved the proposal and the Senate of the UoC has given the green
light for the project. The necessary syllabuses are being prepared at present. Once the degree programmes are commenced, there will
be adequate students throughout the year and we can expect larger resource allocation from the UGC and the Treasury for the
institute. This will hopefully improve the stature and reputation of the institute.
4) Introduction of Web-based Distance Teaching/Delivery: NILIS is also improving its in-house ICT facilities, upgrading the
web with the assistance of University of Colombo to start web based distant learning/teaching programmes. The University is
investing heavily on distant mode of delivery through its virtual university programme and NILIS is planning to be a part of th e
project. We plan to implement the web-based teaching/delivery project gradually from 2013.

Considering all these developments, we are confident that NILIS will improve its present situation in the next couple of years.  As a
result of improving syllabuses, a number of Maldivian students have registered for a postgraduate programme recently. We hope w e
can attract more overseas students in the coming years. I thank the Chairman and the Board of Management, Academic and Higher
Degrees Committees, the Teaching Faculty, Course Co-ordinators and the Administrative Staff for their dedicated work.

My No. : CE/G/NILIS/FA/2011.
Director,
National Institute of Library and Information Science
University of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the National Institute of Library and Information Science
Affiliated to the University of Colombo for the year ended 31st December, 2011 in terms of Section 108(2) of the
Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Section 13(7)(a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971
THE Audit of financial statements of the National Institute of Library and Information Science affiliated to the University of Colombo
for the year ended 31st December, 2011 comprising the balance sheet as at 31st December, 2011 and the income statement, stateme nt of
changes in equity and the cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of accounting policies and other explanatory information
was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Seciton 13 (1) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 and Sections 108(I) and (III) of the Un iversities
Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which I consider should be published with the Annual Report of the Council in terms
of Section 110 of the Universities Act appear in this report. A management report including detailed matters was issued to the Director
of the Institute on 23rd March, 2012.
1:2 Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statments :
The management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of those financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgements, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal contr ol
relevant to the National Institute of Library and Information Science preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the National Institute of Library and Information science’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonable of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of
1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the Audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit opini on.
1:4 Basis for the Qualified Opinion :
My opinion is qualified on the basis of the matters referred to the paragraph 2:2 of this report.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Qualified Opinion :
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements give a  true
and fair view of the financial position of the National Institute of Library and Information Sciences Affiliated to the Univers ity
of Colombo as at 31st December, 2011 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

of Rs. 8,430,218 for the preceding year. The deficit for the year under review had been reduced to Rs. 1,331,723 due to the

adjustment of Rs. 80,500 while the deficit for the preceding year had been reduced to Rs. 2,575,218 due to the Government

as compared with the preceding year due to increase of Government Grant and decrease of depreciation on fixed assets for the
year by 36 percent.

2. Financial Statements
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2:2:1 Accounting Policies
Courses Fee
(i) As the course fee is paid on installement basis and the extension of course duration income cannot be estimated reliably.
Therefore in terms of SLAS 29, Paragraph 29, revenue is recognize only to the extent of expenses recognized that are
recoverable.
(ii) Relevant accounts will be analyzed and corrected in 2012.
2:1:2 Unreconciled Control Accounts

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 08.03.2013
Relevant accounts will be analysed and the difference will be adjusted.
2.1.3 Non compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Managment Decision :
(a) Although the Academic Committee Meetings was scheduled to be held on due dates, due to the strikeaction of Academic
staff two meetings had to be postpond. Due to the absence of the quorum in another two occasions the meetings had to be
postphoned.
(b) (i) The Board Paper on Delegation of Financial Authority Limits was submitted to the Board of Management at it’s Meeting
held in April, 2012 and it was approved by the Board  at the said meeting.
(ii) These advances had been paid out of income generated from Workshops and Seminars. All advances had been issued
subject to the Director’s approval and the advances had been settled within a short period of time.
(iii) Necessary steps were taken to cancel the cheques of which the validity period was expired.
(iv) Library deposits are refunded on a written request made by a student. When the students are not complete the
dissertation/project or when they have to face for repeat examinations, they need to use the library even after the course
is over. Therefore, such students have not requested Library Deposits and acordingly refuns had not been made.
(c) Fixed Assets Register had been prepared according to format 287.
4. Operating Review
4.1 Performance :
(a) and (b) Teacher Librarians are reluctant to register for out courses as their professional qualifications acquired by following our
courses are not recognized and not included in the Teacher’s Service constitution as agreed by the Ministry of Education.
Discussions were held several occasions in this regard. Due to this reason the targeted numbers of students registered have become
low and unable to accomplish the primary objective of the NILIS established stated in its Ordinance No. 4.
(c) Draft Programme of these Courses have been submitted to the Senate for approval.
4.2 Management inefficiencies :
4.2.1 Conducting Courses
(a) We have already filled vacancy of Senior Lecturer Post and he will assume dutiesion 15th June, 2012.
(b) Due to the academic staff strike action and non submission of dissertation on due dates by the students there is a delay in
completing most courses. We have taken action to persuade students to submit dissertations in time.
(c) Some students join courses even after commencement of the course, Therefore income and expenditure cannot be estimated
accuarately. Therefore Budgets of Courses some times had to be prepared even after commencement of such courses.
(d) Course income register will be maintained under the proper supervision.
4:2:2 Library maintenance and control :
(a) Books are supplied to the Library under the supervision of the Assistant Librarian who has an expert knowledge and experience
on the subject. In addition, it has been done with the recommendation of Senior Lecturers of the Institute and the approval of
the Director of the institute.
(b) This is basically a Reference Library. Though, the statistics are not available on the number of students used the library for
reference worklarge number of students use the library. Further, lecturers use the library to conduct various activities relevant
to Courses. Collection of the library is heavily used during the activity sessions. Therefore, it cannot be said that the books
and equipment are underutilized.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 08.03.2013
(c) Lecturers borrow books for Research Work in addition to use them to prepare lecture notes. Therefore it takes somewhat longer
time to return back books to the Library.
(d) Action have been taken to call the Library Committee inorder to obtain recommendations for lost books.
4.2.3 Stock Control :
Stock Register is maintained properly.
4.3 Uneconomic Transactions  :
Due to the lack of adequate staff ETF cheques written on time were unable to present to the ETF Board. Therefore this surcharge
had to be paid.
4.4 Vehicle Utilization :
Necessary action have already been taken to register the vehicle. Running Charts and Log Booksare maintained properly.
5. Accountability and Good Governance
5.1 Corporate Plan:
Corporate plan for 2011-2015 including the action plan has been updated and send to the Ministry for approval.
5.2 Action Plan:
A Perfromance report will be prepared for Action Plan Prepared in future by including expected duration to complete each activity
and the amount allocated.
5.3 Procurement Plan :
Procurement plan will be prepared for future years.
5.4 Budgetary Control :
(a) Budgets will be prepared according to the PED 12 Circular.
(b) Additional amounts had to be paid for Salaries and other recurrent expenditure based on the circulars issued by University Grants
Commission from time to time after preparation of 2012 Budget. This is the main reason for exceeding actual expenditure over
budgetary expenditure.
5.5 Tabling of Annual Reports :
Though, the Annual report had not been tabled in the parliament at that time, it had been sent to the Ministry of Higher Education
in February, 2012 for tabling in the Parliament.
6. Systems and Controls  :
Action will be taken to minimize the deficiencies prevailing in existing systems and controls.
