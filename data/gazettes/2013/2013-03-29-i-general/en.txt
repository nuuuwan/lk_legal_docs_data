The Vice Chancellor,
University of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Colombo for the Year ended 31st December,
2011 in Terms of Section 108 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Section 13(7)(a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971
THE audit of financial statements of the University of Colombo for the year ended 2011 comprising the balance sheet as at 31st December,
2011  and the income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1)
of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, No. 38
of 1971 and Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act, No.16 of 1978. My comments and observations which I consider should be published
with the annual report of the University of Colombo in terms of Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance Act appear in this report.
1:2 Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error.
1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal contr ol
relevant to the University’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3
and 4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope
and the extent of the audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit opini on.
1:4 Basis for Qualified Opinion:
My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Opinion :
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements give a  true
and fair view of the financial position of the University of Colombo as at 31st December, 2011 and its financial performance an d
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements
2:2:1 Sri Lanka Accounting Standards  :
According to the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard No. 29, while accounting the income and expenditure of courses pertaining
to many years, the comparative income of each year should be identified and accounted for. However, the sum of
Rs. 275,349,750 equivalent to the expenditure on courses had been accounted as its income.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 28.03.2013
2:2:2 Accounting Deficiencies :
The following observations are made:-
(a) The financial statements of the University of Colombo for the year under review had been presented on 28th February,
2012. A draft report had been issued on 19th July, 2012 after auditing the accounts. Accounting deficiencies amounting
to Rs. 387,410,330 had been pointed out in the draft report. Of these, accounting deficiencies amounting to
Rs. 329,865,338 had been rectified and revised financial statements had been presented on 07th August, 2012. The
possibility of further such deficiencies apart from the selected sample cannot be ruled out;
(b) The financial grant of Rs. 52,750,000 received for the Project for Internationalization of the Universities of Sri Lanka
had been shown as recurrent grant in the financial statements.
2:2:3 Un reconciled Control Accounts :
The value of publications and books of the College House of the University of Colombo had been shown as Rs. 279,827,114
in the ledger accounts. Its value had been recognized as Rs. 284,622,106 while computing the depreciation for the year 2011.
Accordingly, it was observed that there was a difference of Rs. 4,794,992 between the value shown in the ledger account and
the value recognized for computing the depreciation.
2:2:4 Accounts Receivable and Payable :
The following observations are made:-
(a) The sum of Rs. 7,447,561 retained from contractors from 2005 to 2009 had not been settled due to various reasons;
(b) The period of recovery of the balances of distress loans, festival advances, vehicle loans, employees’ loans, special
advances and computer loans given to the staff of the University amounted to Rs. 1,027,455, Rs. 82,500, Rs. 61,000,
Rs. 45,390, Rs. 26,600 and Rs. 22,500 respectively as at end of the year under review had lapsed;
(c) Amount due from Lecturers who had breached Agreements
(i) It was revealed at test checks that 4 lecturers had left the services during 1982 to 1986 and 4 lecturers had left the
services during 1990 to 1992. All these 8 lecturers had entered in to agreements with the University and a sum of
Rs. 6,514,032 was due from them for breach of bonds. As no action had been taken to recover this up to now, the
recovery had become doubtful due to lapse of time.
(ii) A sum of Rs. 7,922,373 was recoverable from 17 lecturers. This had not been recovered from their gratuity or from
the Universities’ Provident Fund. A court verdict had been granted to recover this amount. However, the amount
concerned had not been recovered and no further action had been taken in this regard up to 31 December, 2011.
2:2:5 Non compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions  :
The following advances had not been settled in terms of Financial Regulation 371 of the Government of Sri Lanka:-
(i) The advances of Rs. 395,370 obtained by 2 officers of the Research and Management Unit had not been settled even
as at 27th April, 2012;
(ii) The advances obtained by the Payments Division on 5 occasions amounted to Rs. 321,000 and the advances obtained
by the Research and Management Division on 32 occasions amounted to Rs. 2,762,832. These advances had been
settled after a delay of 50 to 850 days.
