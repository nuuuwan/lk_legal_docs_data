THE audit of Financial Statements of the University of Jaffna for the year ended 31st December, 2010 was carried out under my direction
in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with
Sections 108 (1) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38

applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1:3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff,
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain
reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination
on a test basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting policies used
and significant estimates made by the managment in the preparaton of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall

of the audit.

2:2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2:2:1 Accounting Policies :
(a) Although the depreciation on property, plant and equipment should be calculated individually to avoid charging the depreciation
on fully depreciated assets in terms of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard No. 18, contrary to this requirement the University had
charged the depreciation on total value of the assets. Therefore, the accuracy of the depreciation shown in the accounts
amounting to Rs. 81,068,839 could not be considered as disclosing the correct position of each asset.
(b) According to the Sri Lanka Accounting standard No. 18 and the University Grants Commission Circular No. 649 of 05th
October, 1995 the depreciation should not be computed for the value of land. However, failure to identify the value of land
and buildings separately the depreciation at a rate of 5% had been provided on lands too.
(c) The statement of changes of equity had not been prepared and presented along with the financial statements in terms of Sri
Lanka Accounting Standard No. 03.
(d) The book value of the fixed assets, which had become Zero value and continued to be used had not been revalued and shown
in the accounts in terms of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard No. 18.
2:2:2 Accounting Deficiencies :
The following accounting deficiencies are observed :
(a) 117 items of journals and periodicals valued to Rs. 2,191,072 had been erroneously included in the books and periodical
accounts without being received to the University.
(b) The constructions works completed during the year under review amounting to Rs. 10,288,750 had been shown in the
account as work-in-progress instead of being shown under the lands and buildings account.
(c) Three busses (City Rider) which was donated by the Government of India during the year under review had not been valued
and brought to accounts.
(d) A three wheeler purchased from the Silver-Jubilee Fund for a sum of Rs. 243,100 had not been brought to accounts since
2006.
(e) Over recovery of bond obligation aggregating Rs. 2,178,090 had been set off against the bond obligation receivable accounts
instead of being shown separately in the accounts as payables.
2:2:3 Accounts Receivable and Payable :
Following observations are made :
(a) The unsettled balances in the sundry creditors accoutns relating to the period 2007 to 2009 was Rs. 221,675 as at the end of
the year under review.
(b) Supplies advance, displaced staff salary advance, building advance, sundry debtors and staff loan balances aggregating
Rs. 157,349,632 had not been recovered for the period ranging from 01 to 23 years. Therefore the recoveries of these balances
are doubtful.
(c) A sum of Rs. 37,455 over paid to an academic staff on account of books allowances in 1997 had not been recovered yet.
(d) According to information made available for audit, a sum of Rs. 117,530,741 was receivable from, 133 lecturers who had
breached agreements and bond obligations during the years 2000 to 2010. Nevertheless, appropriate action had not been
taken to recover this amount from the respective lecturers up to 30th June, 2011.
2:2:4 Lack of Evidence for Audit :
Assets, payables, receivables and depreciations shown in the accounts aggregating Rs. 1,750,016,314 could not be satisfactorily
vouched in audit due to non availability of verification reports, confirmations, age analysis, details schedules etc.

(b) A sum of Rs. 7,611,885 had been paid to a construction company during 1999 to 2000 for the construction work for an

IMPORTANT   NOTICE  REGARDING  PUBLICATION   OF  GAZETTE
THE Weekly issue of the Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka  is normally published on
Fridays. If a Friday happens to be a Public Holiday the Gazette is published on the working day immediately preceding
the Friday. Thus the last date specified for the receipt of notices for publication in the Gazette also varies depending
on the incidence of public holidays in the week concerned.
The Schedule below shows the date of publication and the latest time by which notices should be received
for publication in the respective weekly Gazette. All notices received out of times specified below will not be
published. Such notices will be returned to the sender by post for necessary amendment and return if publication
is desired in a subsequent issue of the Gazette. It will be in the interest of all concerned if those desirous of ensuring
the timely publication of notices in the Gazette  make it a point to see that sufficient time is allowed for postal
transmission of  notices to the Government Press.
The Government Printer does not accept payments of subscription for the Government Gazette.
Note.—Payments for inserting Notices in the Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
will be received by the Government Printer.
