The Vice Chancellor,
Uva Wellassa University.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the Uva Wellassa University for the year ended 31st
December, 2011 in terms of Section 108 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
The audit of financial statements of the Uva Wellassa University for the year ended 31st December, 2011comprising the balance sheet as
at 31st December, 2011 and the income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended  and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions
in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sub-section 1 07 (5) of
the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which I consider should be published with the Annual Report of
the Uva Wellassa University in terms of Section 108 (1) of the Universities Act appear in this report. A detailed report in ter ms of Sub-
section 108 (2) and Section 111 of the Universities Act was issued to the Vice Chancellor of the University on 08th August, 201 2.
1:2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due or error.
1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on  my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the
financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant
to the University’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4)
of the Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and
extent of the Audit.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit opini on.
1:4 Basis for Qualified Opinion :
My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2011 2010
