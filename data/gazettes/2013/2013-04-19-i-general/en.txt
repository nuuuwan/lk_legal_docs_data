Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of  S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
WE have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of the S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation, which comprise
the balance sheet as at 31st December, 2011, and the income statement and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting a nd applying
appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a  test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the
purposes of our audit. We, therefore, believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Opinion :
In our opinion, so far as appears from our examination, the Foundation maintained proper accounting records for the year ended
December 31, 2011 and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Foundation’s state of affairs as at December 31, 2011 and its
result of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

RESPONSIBILITY  STATEMENT  OF  THE
SECRETARY  AND  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTANT
THE year 2012 will go down as a landmark year in the history
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, as we
moved into a fully-fledged multi-storied building, thereby realizing
an important dream which has been high on our agenda for many
years. With the opening of the new building, the divisions of the
institute which operated remotely were brought back to the head
office enabling all services to be provided under one roof for the
benefit of our stakeholders.
CA Sri Lanka recorded 11.3% growth in its revenue and 15.8%
growth in contribution before employee cost compared to 2011.
Overall, all divisions fared well in 2012 which was reflected in
their divisional performance indicator. The overall direct expenses
of CA Sri Lanka increased (6.4%) in line with the expansion
activities and emphasis placed on quality improvement.
The revenue and direct expenses of the Business School
dropped in 2012 compared to the previous year due to the
number of INSEAD programmes conducted during the year which
decreased to one in 2012 from two programmes held in 2011.
However, the contribution from the Business School increased
by 25% over the previous year, due to growth in core activities.
The INSEAD programme had no significant impact on the
division’s overall performance as it was very much of a break-
even activity.
With the formation of the School of Taxation, the division’s
performance has achieved a remarkable growth both in terms of
revenue (75%) and contribution (67.6%).
The net operating income dropped slightly (4.7%) due to
increased overhead expenses during the year.
Materialization of the contractual obligations relating to the
new building mainly during the latter part of the year and the
higher interest rates collectively contributed towards maintaining
the interest income during 2012.
Despite the huge investment made on the new building, the
Institute was successful to register a total comprehensive income
of Rs. 101.7 mn which was only a 3.3% decrease from the
previous year.
Property, plant and equipment increased from Rs. 71.9 mn
to Rs. 591 mn due to the capitalization of the building project
whilst the short-term investments came down to Rs. 242 mn
from Rs. 435 mn due to the disbursement of contractual
obligations. However the total assets increased from Rs. 742 mn
to Rs. 1,030 mn.
The specific internal funds increased from Rs. 21.4 mn to Rs.
44.78 mn due to the formation of the Association of Public
Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL), the pUblic sector
wing of the Institute. The formation of APFASL enabled the
Institute to establish itself in the public sector, thereby fulfilling
a long-standing need. CA Sri Lanka and the Institute of Public
Finance and Development Accountancy (IPFDA), the former
association of public sector accountants which was operating
independently, made a contribution of Rs.10 mn each towards
the formation of APFASL.
The total value of grants increased from Rs. 21.3 mn to Rs.
41.6 mn, which was mainly due to the grant of USD 500,000
made by World Bank. At the initial phase, USD 186,975 was
disbursed which is shown in the statement of financial position.
The above grant was secured with the purpose of enhancing the
quality assurance of financial reporting and auditing in the private
and public sectors. The project is focused on the following areas:
1. Implementing an audit quality assurance programme
2. Programme to assist & educate Small & Medium Sized
Practices (SMPs)
3. Programme to increase adoption of IFRS
4. Programme to strengthen public sector financial management
Most of the cash outflows relating to this project which is
currently underway is expected to materialize during 2013. As
at the reporting date, there was an outstanding payable of Rs.
106.2 mn to contractors of the building project and receipts in
advance of Rs. 155.8 mn (an increase by 28% over the previous
year) which resulted in an increase in current liabilities to Rs.
342.6 mn in 2012 from Rs. 193 mn in 2011. The increase in
receipt in advance is a reflection of the increased demand for our
services.
The total liabilities as at the reporting date showed an increase
of 39% compared to the previous year.
The Institute prepared its first set of accounts in accordance
with SLFRSs and LKASs in 2012.
RESPONSIBILITY  STATEMENT  OF THE SECRETARY
AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTANT
The financial statements comprise the statement of financial
position, statement of comprehensive income, statements of
changes in funds and reserves, statement of cash flows and notes
to the financial statements. These statements have been prepared

Sri Lanka.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial
statements are appropriate and are consistently applied by the

departures from the prescribed accounting standards in their
adoption. Comparative information has been reclassified wherever
necessary to comply with the current presentation.
The significant accounting policies and estimates that involve
a high degree of judgment and complexity were discussed with
our external auditors and the audit committee.
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, the financial
statements and other financial information included in this annual

THE  REPORT  OF  THE  AUDITOR
TO THE COUNCIL OF THE INSTITUTE OF
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS OF SRI LANKA
Report on the Financial Statements
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of The
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (“Institute”)
which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31st
December 2012, and the related statements of comprehensive
income, changes in funds and reserves and the cash flows for the
year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies
and other explanatory notes, as exhibited on pages 56 to 74.
I have also audited the statements of financial position of
F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize
Fund as at 31st December 2012.
Council’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Council is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on my audit. I conducted the audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that
I plan and perform the audit to obtain a reasonable assurance
whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatements.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
I have obtained all the information and explanations which to
the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the
purposes of the audit. I therefore believe that the audit provides
a reasonable basis for my opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, the
Institute, F B Lander prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial
Prize Fund maintained proper accounting records for the year
ended 31st December 2012 and the financial statements give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, F B Lander Prize Fund and
Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st December 2012
and the results of their operations  and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.04.2013
(e) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with SLFRS/LKAS requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the notes to the
financial statements.
1.2 ASSETS AND THE BASES OF THEIR VALUATION
1.2.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or at fair value less accumulated depreciation or impairment
losses.
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation or impairment
losses. Significant components of an asset are identified and depreciated separately. When significant parts of property,
plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the entity derecognises the replaced part, and recognises
the new part with its own associated useful life and depreciation. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised
in the income statement as incurred.
(b) Cost
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing
the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent expenditure incurred for the purpose of acquiring, extending or improving assets of a permanent nature in
order to carry on or increase the earning capacity of the assets has been treated as capital expenditure.
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for
separately, including major inspection and overhaul expenditure, is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised
only if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Institute and its cost
can be measured reliably.
(c) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on the written down values at the following rates
per annum in order to write off the cost of such assets over their estimated useful lives, except in the case of buildings
on leasehold land and computer software:
Generator 20%
Furniture and Equipment 10%
Air- Conditioning Equipment 20%
Audio Visual Equipment 10%
Motor Vehicles 20%
Computers 20%
Canteen Equipment 10%
Head Office Refurbishment 10%
Buildings on leasehold land have been depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their estimated useful lives.
Branch refurbishment expenses are written off over the lease period of the buildings (5 years).

320 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2013'04'19
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.04.2013
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified
as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the assets is included in the statement of comprehensive
income in the year the asset is derecognised.
1.2.2. Educational material - IRQUE project
Assets acquired under this project are depreciated on the following bases: –
(a) Cost of library books are written off on the straight line method over a period of 3 years;
(b) Cost of Multimedia English Learning Centre (MELC) software is written off on the straight line method over a
period of 4 years;
(c) Syllabus development cost is written off on the straight line method over a period of 3 years.
1.2.3 Intangible assets
An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will
flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting
Standard LKAS 38 – Intangible Assets. Accordingly, these assets are stated in the statement of financial position at cost
less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on the straight line method.
1.2.4 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in th e
ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based
on weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their
existing location and condition.
Other inventory items are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
1.2.5 Impairment of assets
The carrying amounts of the assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount isestimated.An impairment loss is recognised
if the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
1.2.6 Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of LKAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,loans
and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Institute determines the classification of its financial assets at
initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of assets not at fair value through profit or los s,
directly attributable transaction costs.
The Institute initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other
financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date
at which the Institute becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Institute derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expires, or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.04.2013
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset is transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is
created or retained by the Institute is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Institute has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The financial assets of the Institute include cash and short term investments and trade and other receivables.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets
designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for
trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with
changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
The Institute has not designated any financial asset upon initial recognition at fair value though profit or loss.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is
included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment are
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs.
Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, employee loans, deposits, advances, other receivables and cash
and cash equivalents.
(c) Held-to-maturity investments (HTM)
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held-to-
maturity when the Institute has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After initial measurement,
held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less
impairment. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The
losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in financial costs.
Investments in government securities and in fixed deposits have been classified under HTM investments.
(d) Available-for-sale financial investments
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are
not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured
at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and
presented in the fair value reserved in funds and reserves. Interest income on available-for-sale debt securities is
calculated using the effective interest rate method (EIR) and is recognised in profit or loss. When an investment is
derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in funds and reserves reclassified to profit or loss.
The Institute has not designated any financial asset upon initial recognition as available-for-sale investment.
1.2.6.1 Impairment of financial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired and if such impairment has occurred, that amount of  impairment is
calculated by takingthe difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
cash flow.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.04.2013
1.2.7 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits at bank.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows,
which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
1.3 LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS
Liabilities classified as current liabilities on the statement of financial position are those which fall due for payment on
demand or within one year from the reporting date. Non-current liabilities are those balances that fall due for payment after
one year from the reporting date.
All known liabilities have been accounted for in preparing these financial statements. Provisions and liabilities are recognise d
when the Institute has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
1.3.1 Grants
1.3.1.1 Accounting for Grants
Grants that compensate the Institute for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the statement of
comprehensive income in the same period in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the
Institute for the cost of an asset are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a systematic basis
over the useful life of the related asset.
1.3.2 Employee Benefits
(a) Provision for Retiring Gratuity
The Institute has adopted the benefit plan as required under the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 for all
eligible employees. The benefit plan is unfunded. Provision for gratuity is computed by the Institute taking into
account the recommendations of an independent qualified actuaries firm, Actuarial and Management Consultants
(Private) Limited. The actuarial valuation was done for the first time in 2010.
Defined benefit plans estimate the amount of benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on
one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of
the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date together with adjustments for unrecognised past service cost. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by the Institute using the projected unit credit method prescribed in Sri
Lanka Accounting Standard 19Employee Benefits (LKAS 19). The present value of the defined benefit obligation is
determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds or
government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. In the absence of such high quality long term
corporate bonds or government bonds, the long term discount rate is determined by examining the market rate of
interest on short term corporate bonds and the anticipated long term rate of inflation.
Gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to
other comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income,
unless the changes to the plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specific period of time (the
vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on the straight line basis over the vesting period.
The key assumptions used by Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited include the following:–
Rate of Interest 10% per annum
Rate of Salary Increase 5% - 10%
Retirement Age 55 years
That the Institute will continue as a going concern

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.04.2013
(b) Defined Contribution Plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment plan under which an entity pays fixed contribution into a separate
entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay a further amount. Obligations for contributions to defined
contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as and when they are due.
(c) Employees’ Provident Fund
The Institute and employees, contribute 15% and 10% respectively, on the salary of each employee to the approved
provident fund.
(d) Employees’ Trust Fund

Provision has not been made for deferred tax, as surplus and income of the Institute other than income from dividends or
interest are exempt from income tax under section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006.
1.3.6 Capital Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or
present obligations where the transfer of economic benefits is not probable or cannot be reliably measured.
Capital commitments and contingent liabilities of the Institute are disclosed in the respective notes to the financial
statements.
1.4 STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

with the SLAS, using the cost model. The Institute has not elected to use the fair value as deemed cost.
1.7.2.2 Significant Accounting Judgment, Estimates and Assumptions
Significant accounting judgment, estimates and assumptions at 1st January, 2011 and at 31 December 2011 are
consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with SLAS effective up to 1st December, 2011
(after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting policies). The estimates used by the Institute to
present these amounts in accordance with SLFRS/LKAS effective from 1st January, 2012 reflect conditions at
1st January, 2011, the date of transition to SLFRS/LKAS and as of 31st December, 2011.
1.7.2.3 Standards Issued but not yet Effective
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Institute’s interim Financial Statements
are listed below. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Institute reasonably
expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date. The
Institute intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.04.2013
(a) SLFRS 9-Financial instruments: classification and measurement
SLFRS 9 replaces LKAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial
liabilities as defined in LKAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January,
2013. The adoption of the first phase of SLFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of
the Institute’s financial assets, but will potentially have no impact on classification and measurement of
financial liabilities. The Institute will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to
present a comprehensive picture.
(b) SLFRS 10-Consolidated financial statements
Not applicable to the Institute.
(c) SLFRS 11-Joint arrangements
Not applicable to the Institute.
(d) SLFRS 12-Disclosure of interests in Other Entities
Not applicable to the Institute.
(e) SLFRS 13-Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under SLFRS for all fair value measurements. SLFRS 13 does
not state when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value
under SLFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The Institute is currently assessing the impact that this
standard will have on the financial position and performance. This standard becomes effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1st January, 2013.
1.8 EXPLANATIONS TO THE TRANSITION OF SLFRS
To comply with the SLFRS 1, the Institute provides explanations to the transition to SLFRS from SLAS. The explanations
include a background and quantification of the change.This also includes reconciliation of the Institute funds and reserves as at
the date of transition 1st January, 2011 and at end of latest comparative reporting period, 31st December, 2011. Reconciliation
for total comprehensive income includes only the latest comparative financial year ended 31st December, 2011.
There is no impact on other items in the financial statement other than employee cost and trade and other receivables.
