for such purpose at a reasonable cost, it no buildings have been constructed on that land or if the ratio between the area 
actually covered by the buildings and the total area of that land is less than the prescribed ratio prescribed by the Council by 
resolution or if the land is not used for permanent or regular farming, for the purpose of that tax, the "Proportion" shall be 
used as the "proportion" as read with Section 165(c)(1)(b) of the Urban Council ordinance. I therefore decide that the ratio 
between the area of land covered by buildings and the total area of the land should be 1:5.
