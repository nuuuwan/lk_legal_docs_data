and expenditure, statement of changes in funds, statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the Financial

In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
Foundation as at 31st December, 2022, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and Medium - sized Entities (“SLFRS for SMEs”).

those standards are further described in the Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of 
our report. We are independent of the Foundation in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of

Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located at Sri Lanka 
Accounting and Auditing Standars website at: http://slaasc.com/auditing/auditorsresponsibility.php. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.

  The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. No adjustments have been made for 
inflationary factors in the Financial Statements. 
 
 (b)  Functional and presentation currency 
  These Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the Foundation’s functional 
currency.  
 
 (c)  Use of estimates and judgments  
 
  The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with SLFRS for SMEs requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of 
which form the basis of making the judgment about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only the financial year or in 
the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future financial years. 
 
1.3 Significant accounting policies 
 
  The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial

  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to rupees at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated 
to rupees at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the reporting date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognized in the statement of income and expenditure.  
 
 (b)  Property, plant and equipment 
 (i)  Recognition and measurement

impairment losses.  
 
  Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and bringing the assets to 
its working condition. 
 
  Gains/losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within “other 
income” in the statement of income and expenditure.  
 
 (ii)  Depreciation 
  Depreciation is recognized in the statement of income and expenditure on a straight-line method for S W R D 
Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation and CHOGM fund over the estimated useful lives of the asset.

  Computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the cost incurred to acquire and bring to use specific 
software. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful life of eight years on reducing balance method. 
 
 (d)  Leased assets 
 
  Property, plant and equipment on finance leases, (which effectively transfer to the Foundation substantially 
the entire risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items) are capitalized at their cash price and 
depreciated/amortized over the period the Foundation is expected to benefit from the use of the leased assets. The 
corresponding principal amount payable to the lessor is shown as a liability.  
 
  The interest element of the rental obligation applicable to each financial year is charged to the statement of income 
and expenditure over the period of the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period. 
 
 (e)  Inventories 
 
        Inventories are valued at the cost. The cost of inventories is based on the first in first out principle, and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing 
location and condition.    
 
 (f) Investments 
  
  Short term investments in treasury bills and fixed deposits are valued at amortized cost.

 (g) Trade and other receivables  
 
  Other receivables are carried at anticipated realizable value. An estimate is made for bad and doubtful receivables 
based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year end. 
 
 (h)  Cash and cash equivalents  
 
  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with bank. 
 
  For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with bank, and net of bank overdrafts. In the statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are included in 
current liabilities. 
 
  Statement of cash flows 
  Statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method. 
 
 (i)  Impairment 
 
  The carrying amounts of the Foundation’s non-financial assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated.  
 
  An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in statement of income and expenditure.  
  
 (j)  Liabilities and provisions 
 
  Liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position when there is a present obligation as a result of 
past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. 
Obligations payable at the demand of the creditors or within one year of the reporting date are treated as current 
liabilities in the statement of financial position. Liabilities payable after one year from the reporting date are treated 
as non-current liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
 
  A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Foundation has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation.  
 
 (k)  Specifics funds 
 
  Where funds are received for use in an identified activity, such funds are held in a specific fund account and transferred 
to the Statement of income and expenditure to match with expenses incurred in respect of that identified activity. 
Unutilized funds are held in their respective fund accounts and included in the Statement of financial position until 
such time as they are required. 
 
 (l)  Taxation 
  Income taxation 
 
  The Foundation is exempt from income tax under the Inland Revenue Act, No.24 of 2017 and subsequent amendments 
thereto. 
 
 (m)  Employee benefits 
 
 i.  Defined benefit obligation 
 
  The Foundation’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit obligation is measured annually using the 

<!-- page 56 -->

projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future benefit that employee have earned in return for their services in the current and prior 
period.  
 
  Gains and losses arising from changes in the assumptions, current service cost and interest are recognized in 
the statement of income and expenditure in the period in which they arise. 
 
  Provision is made for retirement gratuity for all employees in respect of gratuity payable under the Payment of 
Gratuity Act, No.12 of 1983. The provision is not invested in a fund outside the Foundation. The provision is 
not externally funded, nor has it been valued by an actuary. This item is grouped under noncurrent liabilities in 
the statement of financial position. 
 
 ii.  Defined contribution plan 
 
  Obligations to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
The Foundation contributes 12% and 3% of gross emoluments of employees as Provident Fund and Trust Fund 
contribution respectively. 
 
 (n)  Revenue 
 
  Revenue recognition 
 
  Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Foundation and 
the revenue and associated cost incurred or to be incurred can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable, net of trade discounts and turnover taxes. 
 
 (o)  Expenses 
 
  All expenditure incurred in the operations of the Foundation and in maintaining the capital assets in a state of 
efficiency have been charged in arriving at the Foundation’s surplus for the year. 
 
 (p)  Finance expense 
 
  Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, bank charges and debit tax. All borrowing cost are 
recognised in statement of income and expenditure. 
 
 (q)  Comparative information  
       
  Where necessary, comparative figures have been rearranged to confirm with the current year’s presentation.  
 
 (r)  Events occurring after the reporting date 
 
  All material post reporting events have been considered and where appropriate adjustments or disclosures have been 
made in respective notes to the Financial Statements. 
 
 (s)  Commitments and contingencies 
  
  Contingencies are possible assets or obligations that arise from a past event and would be confirmed only on the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events, which are beyond the Foundation’s control.  
 
  Commitments and contingent liabilities are disclosed in Note 22 to the Financial Statements.
