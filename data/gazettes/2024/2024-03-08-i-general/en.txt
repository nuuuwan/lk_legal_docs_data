1. financial Statements
1.1 Qualified Opinion

December 2022 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022 and the statement of financial 
performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under my direction in 
pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read 
in conjunction with Sub-section 107(5) and Section 108 of the universities Act, No.16 of 1978 and provisions of the 
National Audit Act, No.19 of 2018. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the 
Annual Report of the university in terms of Section 108(1) of the university Act, appear in this report. My report to 
Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course.
in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my report, 
the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university as at 31 
December 2022, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
(a)  According to Paragraph 69 of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 07, assets depreciation begins when 
it is available for use. however, as per the accounting policies of the university, assets will not be depreciated in 
the year of acquisition. As a result the depreciation for the year was understated by Rs. 4,338,024.
(b)  the other assets costing for Rs.121,038,191 and the assets received from the Accelerating higher Education 
Expansion and Development (AhEAD) Project costing for Rs. 197,318,037 had been shown under property, 
plant equipment without categorizing of assets of a similar nature or function in an entity's operations according 
to Paragraph 50 of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 07.
(c)  Even though the depreciation had not been calculated for non-current assets received from the AhEAD Project 
during the years from 2019 to the year 2022. As a result, fixed assets and general reserve had been overstated by 
Rs. 78,206,842 and Rs.39,880,387 respectively and the depreciation for the year had been had been understated 
by Rs.38,326,454. As a result, the deficit of the year had been understated by Rs. 38,326,454.
(d)  Even though the fixed assets costing of Rs. 1,079,954,567 and intangible assets costing of Rs. 6,247,846 as at 
31 December 2022 had been fully depreciated, the useful lifetime of non-current assets and intangible assets had 
not been reviewed annually in terms of paragraph 65 of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 7 and 
Paragraph 103 of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 20 and they were being further used. Accordingly, 
action had not been taken to revise the estimated error in terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 3.

(e)  the livestock valued at Rs. 4,646,464 had been incorrectly disclosed under Property, Plant & Equipment instead 
of being shown separately under non-current assets as biological assets in the statement of financial position, as 
required by Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 18.
(f) Capital grant and donations amounting to Rs. 288,849,301 received during the year under review had not been 
recognized as revenue in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 11.
(g)  the land with an extent of 241.2 hectares located in 15 places of the university had not been valued and brought 
to the accounts.
(h)  Even though a 3-storied building costed at Rs. 224,269,514 had been handed over to the university in August 
2020 after completing its constructions, the depreciation had not been accounted from that date until the 
year 2022. As a result, the building value and the general reserve had been overstated by Rs. 14,951,301 and  
Rs. 26,164,777 respectively and the depreciation for the year had been understated by Rs. 11,213,476. As a 
result, the deficit of the year had been understated by Rs. 11,213,476.
(i)  the assets received from the AhEAD Project pertaining to trincomalee Campus worth Rs. 22,025,643 had been 
capitalized twice during the year under review. As a result, the property, plant, and equipment, as well as other 
grants had been overstated by that amount.
(j)  the payment for entertainment allowance amounting to Rs.3,885,562 made through the university Development 
Fund had been erroneously credited to the entertainment allowance expenditure account instead of being 
treated as income. As a result, the income and expenditure for the year under review had been understated by  
Rs. 3,885,562.
(k)  the restricted fund, gifts, donations, and other grants totaling Rs. 1,112,648,116 were erroneously included as 
non-current liabilities in the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, without being shown as part 
of equity.
(l)  the fixed assets received from AhEAD Project amounting to Rs. 65,105,980 had not been accounted for the year 
under review.
(m)  the difference of Rs.21,121,365 was observed between the balance as per statement of financial position and the 
schedule with regard to the provision for gratuity as at   31 December 2022.
(n)  Direct debit in a bank account aggregating to Rs. 3,925,059 and deposits in 2 bank accounts aggregating  
Rs. 1,604,146 had been shown as unidentified debits and unrealized deposits respectively in the bank 
reconciliation without being identified as expenses and income for more than 12 years.
 i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for my qualified opinion.
