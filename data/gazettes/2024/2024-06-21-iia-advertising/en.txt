the number of the question you answer. The right hand margin is  reserved 
for the examiner’s use and nothing should be written there. Num ber your 
answers correctly as incorrect numbering leads to confusion.

up at  the top left hand corner. Do not  tie up at the top right hand corner. 
 (xi) You should personally handover your answer script  to the Supervisor 
or to an Invigilator. Or else remain in your seat till it is co llected.  Failure 
to do so may result in the loss of your script and your being t reated as an 
absentee for the paper. On no account should your script be handed over to 
a peon or an attendant.
 (xii)  If it becomes necessary for you to speak to the Supervi sor or an 
Invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and  raise your 
hand.
