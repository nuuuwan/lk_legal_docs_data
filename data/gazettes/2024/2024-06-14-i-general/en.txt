Admission of Civilian Students to Bachelor of 
Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) 
degree Programme of general Sir John 
Kotelawala defence university (Kdu)
GENERAL  Sir John Kotelawala Defence university being 
desirous of clarifying certain concerns arisen in the public 
domain intends to issue this Notification so that the public at 
large will become aware of true factual circumstances with 
regard to the admission of civilian students to the MBBS 
Degree Programme of KDu. 
Faculty of Medicine of KDu was inaugurated in the year 
2009 and its MBBS Degree Programme commenced in the 
year 2009 mainly to cater to the need of lack of Medical 
Doctors in the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka. However, with 
the gradual fulfillment of the requirements of the Armed 
Forces, KDu started admitting civilian students to the 
MBBS Degree Programme who are children of expatriates 
of Sri Lanka bringing much needed foreign exchange to the 
country, from the year 2013.         
            
Further, in 2017 a total of 864 civilian students registered 
for the MBBS Degree Programme at the South Asia institute 
of Technology and Medicine (SAiTM) were absorbed to 
KDu, in support of the government to resolve a burning 
national issue. Also in 2022, 87 civilian students were sent 
from the university Grants Commission for the MBBS 
Degree Programme again to resolve an issue arisen as a 
results of change in admission criteria/ policy of the National 
universities.
Accordingly, a total of 1337 civilian students had been 
admitted to the MBBS Degree Programme of KDu and of 
them 828 number of students have graduated since 2018 
upto 2023. if the opportunities available at the Faculty of 
Medicine of KDu, after enlisting the required number of 
Medical Officer Cadets of the Armed Forces, are not utilized 
effectively, the financial investments, infrastructure facilities 
and human resources of the Faculty of Medicine and the 
university Hospital (uHKDu ) will be in vain, while the 
country is facing severe shortage of medical professionals.
it was in the above circumstances that the Cabinet of 
Ministers made a Policy Decision on 08th April 2024 to 
grant approval to admit domestic civilian students for the 
MBBS Degree Programme on fee levying basis from the 
year 2024. Accordingly, an advertisement calling for 
applications from potential candidates with local G.c.e 
(Advanced Level) qualifications or equivalent foreign 
examination qualifications such as Cambridge, Edexcel and 
such other examinations was published on the university 
website on 19th April 2024 and in National Newspapers in 
Sinhala, Tamil and English Languages on 21st April 2024.
The above advertisement indicated inter alia the eligibility 
criteria and the closing date of application. Consequently, a

total of 956 applications were received by the closing date 
and the List of such Applicants was published on the 
university website with their Z-scores or results of foreign 
examinations.
After screening the said applications, out of 868 eligible 
candidates, a total of 242 were shortlisted by the ‘Admissions 
Committee’ to attend the Aptitude Test. Candidates with 
local G.c.e. (A/l) results were shortlisted using the 
minimum Z- score published by the uGC for entry to MBBS 
Degree Programme in other State universities in the year 
2021, which is 1.4059. Candidates with foreign examination 
qualifications were shortlisted using the minimum grades 
obtained as A, A and B. Number allocated for each category 
was determined based on the proportion of applications 
received. Accordingly, 216 and 26 candidates became 
eligible from the two categories respectively.
The Aptitude Test comprising three (03) components i.e. 
Paper 1 comprising Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) on 
Subject Knowledge, intelligence Quotient (iQ) and General 
Knowledge, Paper 2 on English Language and Paper 3 on 
Psychometric Assessment, was conducted on 14th May 
2024 at the university Premises, and a total of 203 candidates 
(183 from local G.c.e A/l and 20 from foreign qualifying 
examinations) appeared for the Aptitude Test. Those 
candidates were called for the Structured interview which 
was held on 20th, 21st and 22nd May 2024. Accordingly, 
158 with local G.c.e A/l qualifications and 20 with foreign 
examinations qualifications appeared for the Structured 
interview. 
As approved by the Board of Management of KDu, the 
interview Panel for selecting civilian candidates for MBBS 
degree programme at General Sir John Kotelawala Defence 
university comprised of internal staff members and 
representatives from university Grant Commission (uGC) 
and Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as observers. 
However, representative of the Sri Lanka Medical Council 
did not take part in the interview process. At the Structured 
interview, marks were allocated as 90% to G.c.e A/l or 
Foreign Qualifying Examination results and 10% to other 
achievements such as nationally recognized sports activities 
and proven leadership qualities and abilities.
The details of Eligibility Criteria for applying to the 
MBBS Degree Programme at KDu, composition of the 
Admissions Committee, Structure of the Aptitude Test, 
Composition of the interview Panel and Allocation of Marks 
for Final Selection are published on the university website. 
The details of candidates selected to follow the MBBS 
Degree Programme at KDu, and the Agreement containing 
the conditions which the selected candidates are required to 
entre with the university at the time of registration have also 
been published on the university website. 
in the light of the above stated clarification, it would 
appear that the KDu has taken every possible measure to 
avoid any irregularity in selection of candidates and also to 
uphold the principle of good governance by ensuring 
openness, transparency and accountability in the selection 
process. Moreover, if any candidate is found to have 
provided false information, after selection, the university 
will take steps to terminate such candidate’s studentship in 
accordance with the terms of the Agreement entered into 
between the candidate and the university.
While thanking the support extended by well-wishers, 
the university Administration wishes to take this opportunity 
to assure the candidates and their parents, medical 
professionals, university community and the general public 
that the process of admission of civilian students to the 
MBBS Degree Programme of KDu, was fair, reasonable 
and lawful.

 General Sir John Kotelawala Defence
