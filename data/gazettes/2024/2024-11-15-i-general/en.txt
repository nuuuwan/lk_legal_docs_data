vice Chancellor, 
university of Jaffna.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements and Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements of the 
university of Jaffna for the year ended 31 march 2023 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 
2018
1. financial Statements
1.1 Qualified Opinion
 The audit of the financial statements of the university of Jaffna ("university") for the year ended 31 December 
2023 comprising the statement of financial position as at 3l December 2023 and the statement of financial 
performance, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including material accounting policy information was carried out under my direction in 
pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 
read in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018 and Finance Act No.38 of 1971. 
My report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due 
course.
 in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of 
my report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
university as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended 
in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
(a) Donations amounting to Rs.23,415,770 received during the year under review had been credited to 
restricted fund account instead of recognized as revenue in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector 
Accounting Standard 11. As such, the restricted fund and the surplus for the year under review had been 
overstated and understated respectively by that amount.
(b) A sum of Rs. 16,374,485 had been shown as a rehabilitation project under property, plant, and equipment 
without categorizing according to similar nature or function as per the paragraph 50 of Sri Lanka Public 
Sector Accounting Standard 7.
(c) Computer Science building which was completed and handed over in the year 2022 at a cost of Rs. 
220,700,622 out of the funds of Accelerating higher Education Expansion and Development (AhEAD) 
project had been accounted as income from non-exchange transactions during the year under review 
without adjusting retrospectively in terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 03. Due to 
non-capitalization of the value of the building the depreciation was understated by Rs. 6,437,101 for the 
year under review.
(d) Assets purchased for Rs.13,142,949 during the year under review had not been brought to the accounts.
(e) A sum of Rs.250,609,496 had been donated by Accelerating higher Education Expansion and Development 
(AhEAD) had not been brought to the accounts from 2021.
(f) The Land and Building located in the Puliyankulam which was donated by the Ministry of Policy Planning, 
Economic Affairs, Child, youth and Cultural affairs to the integrated Farm & Training centre activities in 
the year 2015 had not been valued and accounted by the date of this report.
 i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.

 1.3 Other information included in the university’s 2023 Annual Report.
 The other information comprises the information included in the university’s 2023 Annual Report but does not 
include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon, which i have obtained prior to the date of this 
auditor’s report. Management is responsible for the other information.
 My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and i do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
 in connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
 if based on the work i have performed on the other information that i have obtained prior to the date of this 
auditor’s report, i conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, i am required to report 
that fact. i have nothing to report in this regard.
1.4 Responsibilities of management and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
 
 Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
 in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the university’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the university or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
 Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the university’s financial reporting process.
 
 As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018, the university is required to maintain proper 
books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial 
statements to be prepared of the university.
1.5 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
 My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also,
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

2200
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the university’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the university’s ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, i am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. however, 
future events or conditions may cause the university to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the  overall  presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.   
 i communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that i identify during my audit.

Observation  of the Governing Authority  in respect of the issues highlighted  in the report.
1. financial Statements
1.2    Basis  for Qualified Opinion
(a)  The Community Kitchen activities  represent  an ongoing project  within  our organization.  it is imperative 
to clarify the financial treatment of the income generated from these activities. Contrary to being treated as 
traditional donations, the income received from Community Kitchen activities is earmarked for utilization 
within the same fiscal year. Any surplus funds remaining after expenditure are carried forward for allocation in 
the subsequent year.
 in response to the auditors' comments, we will take the necessary actions to recognize community kitchen 
donations as revenue and reflect them in the income statement under the income category  in future.
(b)  The rehabilitation projects are currently ongoing and have not yet been completed. As a result, the projects will 
only be categorized once they are finalized, and  the project completion certificates are received. At present, 
the completion certificates for these rehabilitation projects have not been issued, and the  work  is still  in 
progress.  Our practice has been to capitalize these assets and begin the appropriate depreciation process only 
after receiving the completion  certificates,  which is expected to occur in  2024.
 The purpose of the distinct presentation of rehabilitation work under the property, plant, and equipment schedule 
in our financial statements is to enhance clarity in asset classification. however, it is important to note that this 
presentation does not change the overall financial position of the university, as all figures are accounted for 
within the non-current assets category.
 While we appreciate the emphasis of paragraph 50 of SLPSA 16 on asset classification based on their nature or 
function, it's important to clarify that the separate inclusion of rehabilitation projects under property, plant, and 
equipment cannot be deemed non-compliant. instead, it aligns with the recognition criteria outlined in SLPSAS 
07, paragraph 14 for property, plant, and equipment. The rehabilitation projects we have undertaken represent 
significant investments in assets that directly contribute to enhancing our property,  plant,  and equipment.
 As highlighted in the report, expenditures related to rehabilitation projects will be classified appropriately  in the 
future.
(c) As per the Financial Management Guidelines of the university of Jaffna, any donation,  or gifts in the form 
of goods or funds received, whether from foreign countries or local sources, should be promptly placed to 
the Council on the recommendation of the Finance Committee by the Faculties, Departments, or Divisions. 
Following approval by the Council , donations should be informed to the Finance Branch for proper inclusion in 
the relevant books of accounts and financial  statements.
 
 Although the Department  of  Computer  Science  building  was  inaugurated  on  June  1, 2022, the formal 
handover of the building did not occur until 31st  December  2022.  This  was disclosed in Note 3.7 of the 
2022 financial statement. The donation was reported to  the Council during its 482
nd meeting on 3rd February 
2024. Accordingly, it has been accurately recorded in the 2023 books of accounts, with  depreciation  properly  
calculated  and  charged for the  year 2023.
 however, as indicated in the report, the necessary adjustments will be made to the depreciation charge for the 
period starting from the inauguration date of 1st June 2022, in accordance with SLPSAS 03, as a prior year   
adjustment.
(d) it has been agreed to incorporate unpaid capital expenses into the accounts as accruals and apply the appropriate 
treatments in accordance with the accrual concept in future.

(e) As per the Financial Management Guidelines of the university of Jaffna,  any donation,  or gifts in the form 
of goods or funds received, whether from foreign countries or local sources, should be promptly placed to 
the Council on the recommendation of the Finance Committee by the Faculties, Departments, or Divisions. 
Following approval by the Council, donations should be informed to the Finance Branch for proper inclusion in 
the relevant books of accounts and financial statements.
 The construction of the buildi ng undertaken by AhEAD, along with other similar projects, cannot be recorded 
in the university 's work-in-progress account until the project is completed or formally handed over to the 
university , as is the case with projects funded by the Treasury. The work-in-progress for the Business 
Technology bui lding was not included in the university 's accounts and financial statements for the year 2023, 
as the project was solely managed by AhEAD, and all financial transactions and records were maintained in 
AhEAD's books of accounts. The handover of AhEAD's  work-in-progress  occurred  in 2024, following the 
conclusion of AhEAD operations. At its 482nd meeting on 3rd February 2024, the Council granted approval to 
i nclude this project in the university of Jaffna's work in-progress account. upon the Council 's approval, the 
project has been duly recorded in the university 's work-in-progress  account  for the financial year  2024.
(f)   The  land, buildings,  and  other  assets  allocated  for the  Puliyankulam  integrated  Farm  and Training Center 
activities were provided by the Ministry of Policy Planning, Economics Affairs, Child, and youth Affairs without 
the formal transfer of ownership title to the university. Recognizing these assets in the financial statements 
without clear ownership title poses a notable  concern.
 The official handover process 1s still pending, as we are awaiting the  necessary documentation and reporting 
from the relevant ministry, which is currently not operational. We are exploring alternative  approaches to 
formalize the   transfer.
 The university is working closely with the relevant departments and the Ministry to facilitate the transfer of 
these assets to the books of accounts of the university of Jaffna. however,  due to the ongoing economic crisis 
and the unstable political situation in the country, this process has been delayed. Despite these challenges, we 
are making every effort to complete  the transfer  of asset ownership  as soon as possible.
 Simultaneously,  actions are being taken to value the assets and record  them in the   books.
2. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
 Reference to Rules and Regulation
(a) financial Regulation of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
1.  All advances disbursed adhere strictly to the financial  regulations  stipulated  in 371(2)(b), Public Administration 
Circular No. 3/2015, and uGC Circular  No. 05/2015. These advances are exclusively granted to officer-grade  
staff members  of the university to facilitate the completion of specific tasks. it is imperative  to note that, apart 
from nine instances, all advances have been promptly settled upon the culmination of their respective  purposes.
 The evaluation of advance settlement timelines must consider not only the date of disbursement and settlement

Educational Institutions
i. This  matter  has  been  repeatedly  addressed  in our  previous  responses.  in  the Sri Lankan university system, 
it is customary for academic staff not to sign attendance registers. This practice was formally acknowledged 
during the 372nd Council meeting held on 29th September 2012, where it was emphasized that there is no 
requirement for academic staff to sign such registers. instead, the monitoring of academic staff attendance has 
traditionally been  managed  by the  respective heads of Departments, a stance that has also been supported by 
the consensus among the Deans of faculties.
 This protocol was further reaffirmed during the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting on 11th 
November 2017, where the explanation provided was accepted."
ii.  Effective from 15th August  2024, a new  system  using  a finger scanner  has  been introd uced to confirm staff 
arrival and departure. This system will replace the current  manual  attendance registers.
 Previously, holiday and overtime payments were processed based on the manual attendance registers, which 
were meticulously maintained by the respective departments. Additionally, manual attendance certification and 
authorization were conducted  by  department  heads, serving as the basis for payment  processing .
 With the implementation of the finger scanner, this process will be streamlined, enhancing accuracy and efficiency 
in attendance tracking and payment processing. This transition reflects our commitment to modernizing our 
systems while maintaining  rigorous  standards of accountability  and  authorization.

 Rigorous measures have been implemented to ensure the timely release of examination results. Monthly reports 
detailing the status of result releases, including examination particulars such as dates held and subjects awaiting 
results, along with the duration of any delays, are meticulously  compiled  and  submitted  to the Senate.
 Furthermore, an internal Circular, endorsed by the Competent Authority  on  04.03.2020 and subsequently 
reported to the Council, delineates the requisite procedures, guidelines, and regulations aimed at expediting the 
result release process. Efforts have been directed towards vigilant oversight of this process, resulting in a notable 
enhancement in result release efficiency  compared  to previous years.
 To further institutionalize these efforts, timelines for result  releases  have  been incorporated into the Examination 
Bylaws, pending approval by  the  Council. This proactive measure is intended to reinforce accountability and 
adherence to established timelines  in the result release process.

to 2017. Subsequently, at its 426th  meeting convened on 24.02.2018, the Council approved the policy paper on 
bond obligations and provided  authorization  for  its  implementation within the administrative framework of 
the university of Jaffna.

to the Council for potential legal action. The Committee convenes regularly to conduct thorough evaluations 
with the objective of addressing the longstanding outstanding balances.
 Furthermore, COBA  has addressed matters concerning academic staff who commenced duties without completing 
their postgraduate studies within the stipulated study leave period. Recommendations regarding appropriate 
actions were presented to the Council based on discussions held during the  16th meeting on   20.04.2022.
