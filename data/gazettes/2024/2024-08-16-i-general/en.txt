INDEPENDENT   AuDITOR 'S   REPORT
To the members of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Sri Lanka
Report on the Audit of the financial Statements 
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of the Chartered institute of taxation  of Sri  Lanka (“the institute”), which 
comprise the statement of financial position as at 31st March 2024 and the statement of comprehensive income, statement 
of changes in fund and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including 
material accounting policy information.
in our opinion, the accompanying financial statements of the institute give a true and fair view of the financial 
position of the institute as at 31
st March, 2024, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SLFRS for SMes).
basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the institute in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by CA 
Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of Council's and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements.
Council is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SLFRS for SMes) and for such internal control as 
Council determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, Council is responsible for assessing the institute's ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless Council either intends to liquidate the institute or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the institute's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from  
material  misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and  to issue an auditor's  report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is  an assurance of a high level, but not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SLAuSs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at Sri Lanka 
Accounting and Auditing website at: http://slaasc.com/auditing/auditorsresponsibility.php. this  description forms part of 
our auditor’s report.
