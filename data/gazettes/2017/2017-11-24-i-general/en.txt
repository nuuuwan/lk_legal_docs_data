PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.11.2017 1825
2.4 Materiality & aggregation
In compliance with section 03 on SLFRS for SMEs on presentation of ﬁ nancial statements, each material class 
of similar items is presented separately in the ﬁ nancial statements. Items of dissimilar nature or functions too are 
presented separately, if they are material.
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of ﬁ nancial position, 
only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are not off-set in the 
statement  of comprehensive income unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or interpretation, and 
as speciﬁ cally disclosed in the accounting policies.
3. Summary of signi ﬁ cant accounting policies
The Signiﬁ cant accounting policies applied by the Foundation in preparation of its ﬁ nancial statements are included 
below. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
ﬁ nancial statements.
a) Useful life - time of the property, plant and equipment
The Foundation reviews the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of assets as at each reporting 
date. Judgment of the management is exercised in the estimation  of these values, rates, methods and hence they 
are subject to uncertainty. 
b) Going concern
The Board members have made an assessment of the Foundation’s ability to continue as a going concern and are 
satisﬁ ed that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the board is not 
aware of any material uncertainties that may cast signi ﬁ cant doubt upon the Foundation’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and  they do not intend either to liquidate or to cease operations of the Foundation. Therefore, the 
ﬁ nancial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
c) Impairment losses on ﬁ nancial assets  
The Foundation assesses at each reporting date or more frequently to determine whether  there is any objective 
evidence whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.
d) De ﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans 
The cost of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans are determined using half month salary basis.
4.1 Revenue recognition 
4.1.1 Revenue
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic bene ﬁ ts will ﬂ ow to the Foundation and 
the revenue and associated cost incurred or to be incurred can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable, trade discounts and turnover taxes.
4.1.2 Rendering of services 
Revenue from rendering of services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services rendered prepared.
4.1.3 Interest income
Interest income is recognized using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.
4.1.4 Other income 
Other income is recognized on an accrual basis.

1826
4.2 Expenditure  recognition
Expenses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income on the basis of a direct association between 
the cost incurred and the earning of speci ﬁ c items of income. All expenditure incurred in running the business 
and in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of ef ﬁ ciency has been charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income.
For the purpose of presentation of the statement of comprehensive income, the “function of expenses” method has 
been adopted, on the basis that it presents fairly the elements of the Foundation’s performance. 
4.3 Taxation
The foundation shall be exempted from any income tax or wealth tax payable under the Inland Revenue Act,                    
No. 4 of 1963
4.4 Non- ﬁ nancial asset
     4.4.1 Property, plant and equipment
 Recognition and measurement 
 Property, plant & equipment are recognized if it is probable that future economic bene ﬁ ts associated with the asset 
will ﬂ ow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with LKAS 16 - property, 
plant & equipment. Initially property, plant and equipment are measured at cost.
 Cost model  
 Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated  impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the equipment 
when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. 
 Subsequent cost 
 Subsequent expenditure incurred for the purpose of acquiring, extending, or improving assets of a permanent nature 
by means of which to carry on the business or to increase the earning capacity of the business is treated as capital 
expenditure and such expenses are recognized in the carrying amount of an asset. The costs associated with day-to-
day servicing of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

De- recognition 
Property, plant and equipment are de- recognized on disposal or when no future economic bene ﬁ ts are expected from their 
use. Any gain or loss arising on de- recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in ‘other operating income’ in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the year the asset is de- recognized. 
4.4.2 Intangible assets  
Computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speciﬁ c 
software. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful life of eight (8) years. 
4.4.3 Impairment of non- ﬁ nancial assets 
The Foundation assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Foundation estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. 
4.5 Leasehold property  
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are initially recognized as assets of the Foundation at their fair value at the inception 
of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the statement of ﬁ nancial position as a ﬁ nance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁ nance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately 
in proﬁ t or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in 
accordance with the Foundation’s general policy on borrowing costs. 
4.6 Investment property  
(a) Cost 
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/ or for capital appreciation, is measured at its cost, 
including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
(b) Depreciation  
The provision for depreciation is calculated by using the reducing balance method on the cost of investment 
property, in order to write off such amounts over the estimated economic lives of such assets. 
4.7 Financial assets- recognition and measurement  
4.7.1 Initial recognition
All ﬁ nancial assets are initially recognized on the trade date, i. e., the date that the Foundation becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes ‘regular way trades’: purchases or sales of ﬁ nancial 
assets that require delivery of assets within the time- frame generally established by regulation or convention in the 
market place. 
4.7.2 Initial measurement
The classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial instruments at initial recognition depends on their purpose and characteristics and 
the management’s intention in acquiring them. All ﬁ nancial instruments are measured initially at their fair value 
including transaction costs, except in the case of ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities recorded at fair value 
through proﬁ t or loss. 
4.7.3  Subsequent measurement
The Foundation subsequently measures non- derivative ﬁ nancial assets categorizing them in to the categories 
of ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through pro ﬁ t or loss, held- to maturity investments, loans and receivables and 
available- for- sale ﬁ nancial assets. 
 (i) Financial assets at Fair Value Through Proﬁ t or Loss (FVTPL)
  A ﬁ nancial asset is classiﬁ ed as fair value through proﬁ t of loss if it is held for trading or is designated at fair 
value through proﬁ t or loss. 
 (ii) Loans and receivables 
  Loans and receivables include non- derivative ﬁ nancial assets with 
ﬁ xed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market, other than:

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.11.2017 1829
- Those that the Foundation intends to sell immediately or in the near term and those that the Foundation, 
upon initial recognition, designates as at fair value through proﬁ t or loss
- Those that the Foundation, upon initial recognition, designates as available for sale 
- Those for which the Foundation may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than 
because of credit deterioration. 
After initial measurement, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method less 
allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortization is included in ‘interest income’ in the statement of 
comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in 
‘impairment gain/ (loss) on loans and receivables’. 
iii Available- for- sale ﬁ nancial investments
Available- for- sale investments include loans given to the employees. Available for sale are those which are 
neither classiﬁ ed as held for trading nor designated at fair value through proﬁ t or loss. The Foundation has not 
designated any loans or receivables as available- for- sale. 
After initial measurement, available- for- sale ﬁ nancial investments are measured at fair value. Unrealized 
gains and losses are recognized directly in equity (other comprehensive income) in the “available – for-sale 
reserve”. When the investment is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating income. 
4.7.4   De- recognition of ﬁ nancial assets
A ﬁ nancial asset (or, where applicable a part of a ﬁ nancial asset or part of a Foundation of similar ﬁ nancial assets) 
is de- recognized when: 
- The rights to receive cash ﬂ ows from the asset have expired. 
- The Foundation has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂ ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash ﬂ ows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass- through’ 
arrangement and either:

 The Foundation has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or 
 The Foundation has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset. 
4.7.5.  Identiﬁ cation, measurement and assessment of impairment 
At each reporting date the Foundation assesses whether there is objective evidence that ﬁ nancial assets not carried 
at fair value through pro ﬁ t or loss are impaired. A ﬁ nancial asset or a Foundation of ﬁ nancial assets is impaired 
when objective evidence demonstrates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (s), and 
that the loss event has an impact on the future cash ﬂ ows of the asset (s) that can be estimated reliably. 
The Foundation writes off loans and advances and investment securities when they are determined to be 
unrecoverable. 
4.8    Cash and bank balances 
For the purpose of cash ﬂ ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and deposits in banks 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Investments with short maturities i. e. three months or less from the date of 
acquisition are also treated as cash equivalents.

4.9.2.  Deﬁ ned contribution plan 
A deﬁ ned contribution plan is a post- employment bene ﬁ t plan under which an entity pays ﬁ xed contributions 
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for 
contributions to de ﬁ ned contribution plans are recognized as an employee bene ﬁ t expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income as in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
 a. Employees’ Provident Fund
  The Foundation and employees contribute 12% and 8% respectively on the salary of each employee to the 
approved Provident Fund. 
 b. Employee’s Trust Fund  
  The Foundation contributes 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.
4.10  Financial liabilities 
4.10.1 Initial recognition and measurement 
The Foundation classiﬁ es ﬁ nancial liabilities in to ﬁ nancial liabilities at Fair Value through Proﬁ t or Loss (FVTPL) 
or other ﬁ nancial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the deﬁ nitions of 
ﬁ nancial liabilities.
The Foundation recognizes ﬁ nancial liabilities in the statement of ﬁ nancial position when the Foundation becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the ﬁ nancial liability.
 i. Financial liability at FVTPL
  Financial liabilities at FVTPL include ﬁ nancial liabilities held – for – trading or designated as such upon initial 
recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, ﬁ nancial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value, and 
changes there in recognized in proﬁ t or loss.
  Upon initial recognition, transaction cost are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in pro ﬁ t or 
loss as incurred. The criteria for designation of ﬁ nancial liabilities at FVTPL upon initial recognition are the 
same as those of ﬁ nancial assets at FVTPL.
 ii. Other ﬁ nancial liabilities
  Other ﬁ nancial liabilities including deposits, debt issued by the Foundation and the other borrowed funds 
are initially measured at fair value less transaction  cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition and 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking  into 
account any discount or premium on the issue and costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
4.10.2  De-recognition of ﬁ nancial liabilities
 A ﬁ nancial liability is de- recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing ﬁ nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi ﬁ ed, such an exchange or modi ﬁ cation is treated as a                    
de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying 
value of the original ﬁ nancial liability and the consideration paid is recognized in proﬁ t or loss.
4.11
 Provisions
 Provisions are recognized when the Foundation has a present obligation  (legal or constructive) as  a  result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an out ﬂ ow of resources embodying economic bene ﬁ ts will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. 
4.12  Cash ﬂ ow statement 
 The cash ﬂ ow statement has been prepared using the indirect method, as stipulated in Section 07 in SLFRS for                
SME- statement of cash ﬂ ows. Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand, cash at bank and bank overdrafts.

S. W. R. D. BANDARANAIKE  NATIONAL  MEMORIAL  FOUNDATION
Financial Statements for the Year ended 31st December, 2014
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO  THE  COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT  OF  S. W. R. D.  BANDARANAIKE  NATIONAL 
MEMORIAL  FOUNDATION 
Report on the ﬁ nancial statements 
We have audited the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements of the S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation               
(“the Foundation”), which comprise the statement of ﬁ nancial position as at 31st December, 2014, and the statements of 
income and expenditure, changes in funds and cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of 
signiﬁ cant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The corresponding ﬁ gures presented are based on the ﬁ nancial statements of the Foundation as at and for the year ended 
31st December, 2013, which are audited by another auditor, whose report dated 06th January, 2015 expressed an unmodiﬁ ed 
opinion on those statements.
Management’s responsibility for the ﬁ nancial statements 
The Committee of management (“the Committee”) is responsible for the preparation of these ﬁ nancial statements that 
give true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and Medium Sized Entities (SLFRS 
for SMEs), and for such internal control as the Committee determines is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁ nancial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditors’ responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁ nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair view in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Committee, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁ nancial statement 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements.
Except as discussed in following paragraph, we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁ cient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our qualiﬁ ed audit opinion.
Basis for qualiﬁ ed opinion  
We were unable to verify if speci ﬁ c funds maintained by the Foundation amounting to Rs. 625,272,289 were utilized for 
the purpose for which they were intended, as the Foundation has not matched the funds with a corresponding investment or 
asset.  
Qualiﬁ ed Opinion 
In our opinion, except for the possible effect of the matter described in the basis for qualiﬁ ed opinion paragraph, the ﬁ nancial 
statements give a true and fair view of the ﬁ nancial position of the Foundation as at 31st December, 2014, and of its ﬁ nancial 
performance and its cash ﬂ ow for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and 
Medium Sized Entities.

S. W. R. D. BANDARANAIKE NATIONAL MEMORIAL FOUNDATION
Financial Statements for the Year ended 31st December, 2015
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT OF S W R D  BANDARANAIKE  NATIONAL  MEMORIAL  FOUNDATION 
Report on the ﬁ nancial statements 
We have audited the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements of the S W R D Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation                  
(“the Foundation”), which comprise the statement of ﬁ nancial position as at 31st December, 2015, and the statements of 
income and expenditure, changes in funds and cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of 
signiﬁ cant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
Management’s responsibility for the ﬁ nancial statements 
The Committee of management (“the Committee”) is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and Medium-Sized Entities (“SLFRS for SMEs”). 
This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of ﬁ nancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditors’ responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁ nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair view in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Committee, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁ nancial statement 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the ﬁ nancial position of the Foundation as at 31st 
December, 2015, and of its ﬁ nancial performance and its cash ﬂ ows for the period then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Accounting Standard for Small and Medium Sized Entities (“SLFRS for SMEs”).
