31st December, 2015  in terms of Section 108 (1) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
tHE audit of financial Statements of the university of Jaffna for the year ended 31st December, 2015 comprising 
the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2015 and the statement of financial performance, statement of 
changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) 
of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 107 (5) of the 
universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the Annual 
Report of the university in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act, appear in this report. A detailed report 
in terms of Sub-section 108(2) of the university Act, No. 16 of 1978 issued to the Vice Chancellor of the university on 
09th September, 2016.
 1:2 management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements :
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due 
to fraud or error.

accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Standards of Supreme Audit institutions

(iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
  And audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the 
finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary power to the Auditor General to determine the scope and the extent 
of the audit.
  i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.

  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.

3.  Financial Review
 3.1 financial Results
  According to the financial Statements presented, the operations of the university during the year under review 
had resulted in a deficit of Rs. 141,526,367 as compared with the corresponding deficit of Rs. 124,793,315 for 
the preceding year, thus indicating a further deterioration of 16,733,052 in the financial results. the main reasons 
for this deterioration were increase of personal emoluments, maintenance expenses, contractual services and 
other operating expenses.
  Even though the operations of the university during the year under review had resulted in a deficit 
of Rs. 141,526,367, the contribution of the university to the Country during the year under review was

4. Operating Review
 4.1 Performance :
  the academic performance of the university during the year under review was as follows:- 
 ( a) Results of examinations
  According to the university Grants Commission Circular No. 636 of 14th July, 1995, results of the examinations 
should be released within three months after the examination held. Nevertheless, dates to hold the examinations 
for various courses conducted under each faculty of the university and target dates to release results of the 
examinations had not been determined. it was further observed that there were considerable period of delays 
in releasing the results of examinations ranging from 04 months to 07 months by the faculties of Agriculture, 
Arts, Management Studies and Commerce, Science and External Examinations unit of the university during 
the years 2014 and 2015. thereby, the students had been deprived to get their employment opportunities in 
time. Even this matter was pointed out in my previous year audit reports; no meaningful action had been taken 
by the relevant authorities to release the results in terms of provisions in the above Circular;
 ( b) Cost per Student
  t otal number of students registered at the university and the cost per student for the year under review and in 
previous three years is shown below:

Cost per student (Rs.) 151,484 118,999 142,433 109,262
  the Cost per student of the university had increased by Rs. 32,485 or 27.29 per cent during the year under 
review as compared with previous year even though the total number of students at the university are almost 
equal in these two year;
 ( c) Payments of Research Grants and Research Allowances
  Research grants and research allowances amounting to Rs. 8,895,019 and Rs. 62,845,674 respectively had been 
paid during the year under review. in this connection the following observations were made:-
