ThE REPORT Of ThE AuDITOR
To the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka
Report on the financial Statements
i have audited the accompanying financial statements of the institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, (“the 
institute”), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31st, 2016, and the statement of 
comprehensive income, statement of changes in funds and reserves and statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. i have also audited 
the statements of financial position of f.B. Lander Prize fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize fund as at 31st 
December, 2016. 
management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements

Auditor’s Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit 
in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards.those standards require that i comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the 
auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
in my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the institute, f.B. Lander 
Prize fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize fund as at December 31st, 2016, and of its financial performance 
and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

1.7 Basis of preparation of financial statements
1.7.1 Statement of compliance
the financial statements of the institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards 
issued by the institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
these financial statements comprise the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in funds and reserves, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements.
the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. these 
policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements unless otherwise stated.
1.7.2 Basis of measurement
the financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost basis, except where 
appropriate disclosures are made with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
1.7.3 Comparative information
Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of 
the previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements in order to enhance the understanding 
of the financial statements of the current period and to improve comparability.
 Where necessary, comparative figures have been rearranged to conform to the current year’s presentation.  
1.7.4 Materiality and aggregation
 Each material class of similar items is presented separately in the financial statements. items of a dissimilar 
nature or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.
1.7.5 Functional and presentation currency
the financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the institute’s functional and presentation 
currency, in the primary economic environment in which the institute operates.
All financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless 
stated otherwise.
1.8 Significant accounting estimates and judgments
the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, 
requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.  
information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows:-
(a) Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) and Accounting for Association of Public 
finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APfASL)
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all 
factors and circumstances in SLfRS 10 “Consolidated financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows;
(a) power over the investee;
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns, 
Accordingly, management has determined that there is no requirement for consolidation.

(b) Defined benefit plans
the cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected unit Credit (PuC) 
method. Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase and 
retirement age. Due to the long term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
(c) Changes in accounting estimates and judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the 
financial statements.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1  Assets and the bases of their valuation 
2.1.1 Property, plant and equipment 
(a) basis of recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the asset will flow to the institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. the carrying value of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
(b) Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, 
in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
the estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:-
 Asset category Useful life  
 Buildings 5-50 years  
 furniture  5- 10 years
 Plant and Machinery  5-10 years
 Motor vehicles 10 years
 Computers 5 years
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset 
is classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.  
Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identified and 
depreciated. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the statement 
of comprehensive income. the correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of the related 
asset.
(c) Derecognition 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year the asset is derecognised.

920
2.1.2       Library books 
Cost of library books are written off on the straight line basis over a period of 3 years.
2.1.3  Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. these are expenses of a capital nature 
directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-
in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is 
available for use i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the institute.
2.1.4 Intangible  assets
a. Computer software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to 
use. these costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five (5) years. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled 
by the institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
1. it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
2. management intends to complete the software product and use it;
3. there is an ability to use the software product;
4. it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
5. adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use  the software 
product are available; and
6. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognised as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed five 
(5) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress until the software 
is ready for use.
b. Study material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA qualifications 
are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new curriculum, the investment 
attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably measured and it can be demonstrated 
that it will generate probable future economic benefits
these costs are amortised over the effective period of the new curriculum and the remaining useful life is 
reviewed at least at each financial reporting year end.
2.1.5       Inventories
inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and 
slow moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the 
estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. the cost of inventories is based on weighted average cost. 
the cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location 
and condition. 
the inventories of the institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.         
    
2.1.6       Impairment of non-financial assets
the institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. if such 
indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the institute makes an estimate of 

<!-- page 21 -->

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 23.06.2017
921
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows 
that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. 
impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. if that is the case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. the increased amount cannot “exceed” the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.1.7      Financial assets – Initial recognition and measurement
financial assets within the scope of LKAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit  or 
loss,loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. the institute determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of assets not at fair value through profit 
or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
the institute initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other 
financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the 
trade date at which the institute becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
  
financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position 
when, and only when, the institute has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net 
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
the financial assets of the institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, Held-to-Maturity financial 
Assets, Available-for-sale financial Assets,repurchase agreements and cash and cash equivalents. 
(a)     Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the Effective interest Rate (EiR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated 
by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EiR. the EiR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. the 
losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs.
 
initially, loans and receivables are recognised on the date that they are originated. Loans and receivables are 
stated at their cost net of an allowance on outstanding amounts to cover the risk of non-payment.
Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, employee loans and advances, deposits and other 
receivables.
(b)     held-To-maturity financial Assets (hTm)
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified 
as HtM when the institute has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After initial 
measurement, HtM investments are measured at amortised cost using the Effective interest Rate 
(EiR) method, less impairment. the EiR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of 
comprehensive income. the losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income in financial costs.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 23.06.2017
922
investments in fixed deposits and government securities have been classified under HtM investments.
(c) Available-For-Sale FinancialAssets (AFS)
AfS financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as AfS or are not classified in 
any of the above categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair 
value and changes therein, other than impairment losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
presented in the fair value reserve in funds and reserves. interest income on AfS financial assets is calculated 
using the effective interest rate method (EiR) and is recognised in profit or loss. When an investment is 
derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in funds and reserves reclassified to profit or loss.
investments in government securities have been classified under AfS investments. 
2.1.8      Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) 
is derecognised when:
 
(a) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired
(b) the institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either 
i) the institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
ii) the institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset.
When the institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset nor transferred control of it, the asset is recognized to the extent of the institute’s continuing 
involvement in it.
in that case, the institute also recognises an associated liability. the transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the 
institute could be required to repay.
2.1.9 Impairment of financial assets  
the institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a 
group of financial assets is impaired and if such impairment has occurred, that amount of  impairment is calculated 
by taking the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset or assets (an 
incurred “loss event”) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant 
financial difficulty or default in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy 
or any financial reorganisation, and when observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in future 
cash flows, such as change in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. if any indication exists, 
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is then recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent 

<!-- page 23 -->

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 23.06.2017
923
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
2.1.10 Cash and cash equivalents 
the institute considers cash in hand, amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the institute’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand,cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements. 
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of 
cash flows, which has been prepared using the 'indirect method'.
2.2 Liabilities and provisions 
A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or there is no 
unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. 
the institute classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
2.2.1  financial liabilities
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are stated at amortised cost with any difference between 
cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the 
loan on an effective interest basis.
interest-free loans are recorded at fair value on initial recognition, which is the present value of the expected 
future cash flows, discounted using a market related rate. the difference between the cost and the fair value of 
these loans on initial recognition has been recognised immediately as interest income while the corresponding 
unamortised interest expenditure recognised in statement of financial position has been amortised over the 
period of the loan. 
2.2.2  Deferred Income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes  are raised  at the 
commencement of the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months.  Deferred 
income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken place and 
the balance attributable to the remaining course period is recognised as a liability on the statement of financial 
position until income is recognised.
2.2.3 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when institute has a legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the 
obligation and the obligation can be measured reliably. 
2.2.3.1  Employee benefits
(a) Employee defined benefit plan - Gratuity
Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. the defined 
benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected unit Credit (PuC) method.the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions about discount rate future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature 
of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each 
reporting date. Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based on the actuarial valuation as of 31st

924
December, 2016. the institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognize actuarial gains and losses 
in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive income. 
(b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund 
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident fund Contributions and Employees’ trust fund Contributions 
in line with respective statutes and regulations. these are recognized as an expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income as incurred. the institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross emoluments of the employees 
to Employees’ Provident fund and Employees’ trust fund respectively.
2.2.4 Taxation
(a) Incometax 
the surplus and income of the institute other than surplus and income from dividends or interest is exempt 
from income tax under Section 7(b) (ii) of the inland Revenue Act, No.10 of 2006.
