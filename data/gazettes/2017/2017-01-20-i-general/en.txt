changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of 
the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sub-section 107 (5) of the 
universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the Annual 
Report of the university in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act appear in this report. A detailed report 
in terms of Sub-section 108 (2) of the universities Act was issued to the Vice Chancellor of the university on 05th 
September, 2015.
 1:2 Management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements :
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due 
to fraud or error.
 1:3 Auditor’s Responsibility:
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Standards of Supreme Audit institutions 
(iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of 
the finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and the 
extent of the audit.
  i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. financial Statements :

financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting 
Standards.
