Report of the University in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the Universities Act appear in this report. A detailed report in 
terms of Sub-section 108 (2) of the Universities Act will be submitted in due course.
 1.2 Management’s Responsibilities for the financial Statements

with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due

in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Auditing Standards of Supreme 
Audit institutions (iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material

material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor cosiders internal control relevant to the University’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of 
the finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent 
of the audit.
  i believe that the evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
