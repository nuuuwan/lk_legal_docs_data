PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 23.11.2012
The Vice Chancellor,
University of Jaffna.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Jaffna for the Year ended 31st December, 2009 in
terms of Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.
The audit of Financial Statements of the University of Jaffna for the year ended 31st December, 2009 was carried out under my
direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka r ead in
conjunction with Sections 108 (1) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13 of the
Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. This report issued in terms of Section 108 (2) of the Universities Act. A detailed report in terms of Section 13(7)
(a) of the Finance Act was furnished to the Vice Chancellor of the University on 23rd July, 2010.
1:2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards.  This responsibility includes, designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
1:3 Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. Audit opinion, comments and findings
in this report are based on review of the financial statements presented to audit and substantive tests of samples of transactions. The
scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff,
other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain
reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination
on a test basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting policies used
and significant estimates made by the managment in the preparaton of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall
presentation. I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary
for the purpose of my audit. I therefore, believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. Sub-sections (3) and (4)
of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent
of the audit.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Opinion :
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that the University of Jaffna had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st December, 2009 and except for the
effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements have b een
prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the University of
Jaffna as at 31st December, 2009 and the financial results of its operation and cash flows for the year then ended.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2:2:1 Accounting Policies :
(a) Although the depreciation on property, plant and equipment should be calculated individually to avoid charging the depreciation
on fully depreciated assets in terms of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard No. 18, contrary to this requirement the University had
charged the depreciation on total value of the assets. Therefore, the accuracy of the depreciation shown in the accounts
amounting to Rs. 101,953,469 could not be considered as disclosing the correct position of each asset.
(b) According to the University Grants Commission Circular No. 649 of 05th October, 1995 and Sri Lanka Accounting Standard
No. 18, the depreciation should not be computed for the value of land. However, due to failure to identify the value of land
and buildings separately the depreciation at a rate of 5% had been provided on lands as well.
2:2:2 Accounting Deficiencies :
The following observations are made :
(a) Even though Books and periodical valued to Rs. 2,191,072 had not been received to the University up to the end of the year
under review, depreciation amounting to Rs. 438,214 had been charged on these items of asset.

(b) Payment of gratuity amounting to Rs. 1,827,934 had not been charged against the provision for payment of gratuity in the
accounts.
2:2:3 Accounts Receivable and Payable
Following observations are made :
(a) Supplies advance, displaced staff salary advance, building advance, sundry debtors and staff loan balances aggregating
Rs. 4,718,972 had not been recovered for the period ranging from 01 to 23 years. Therefore the recoveries of these balances
are in doubtful.

respectively.

(d) A sum of Rs. 37,455 over paid to an academic staff on account of books allowance in 1997 had not been recovered yet.
2:2:4 Lack of Evidence for Audit :

satisfactorily vouched in audit due to non availability of required evidence.
2:2:5 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions :

3:2 Human Resources Management
The Following observations are made :
(a) Appointments to the permanent posts of lecturers had been made separately to each and every Faculty of the University as a
general rule resulting in engaging several lecturers in the same field of study. In preparing time tables of various Faculties, the
availability of the service of permanent lecturers in other Faculties had not been considered. Whenever the service of lecturers in
the permanent staff were required for another Faculty, separate letters of appointment had been issued to them as visiting
lecturers and additional lecture fees had been paid for such services.
(b) In several instances, temporary lecturers, tutors, demonstrators etc. had been appointed on the request made by the Heads of
Department of the University without following proper recruitment procedures.
(c)  The regular feature of the University in filling the vacant posts of academic staff is in an improper manner without giving a n
opportunity to complete those who have qualified and expecting employment in the University system. Although this had been
pointed out in my reports for the last several years, no action had been taken to rectify these deficiencies.
3:3 Courses and Examinations
The Following observations are made :
(a) Total numbers of students registered in 10 courses of the University were 4776. Total recurrent expenditure incurred during the
year under review amounted to Rs. 423,716,860. The average recurrent cost per student for the year was Rs. 88,718
(b) Dates to hold the examinations for various courses conducted under each faculty of the University and target dates to release
results of the examinations had not been determined. It was further observed that there were considerable delays in releasing the
results of examinations conducted by certain Faculties during the years 2008 and 2009. According to the University Grants
Commission Circular No. 636 of 14th July, 1995 results should be released within three months after the examination. But
results had been delayed by periods ranging from 6 to 12 months.

3:4 Granting Leave with Pay and No Pay for Postgraduate Studies
The Following observations are made :
(a) Study leave had been approved for more than one year to the lecturers who had gone abroad for studies without taking into
consideration of the instructions stipulated in Section 27.4 of Chapter 10 of the Establishments Code for the University Grants
Commission and the Higher Educational Institutions.
(b) There were instances of approving study leave to the lecturers who were under probationary period before completing one year
service.
3:5 Budgetary Control
Significant variations were observed between the budget and the actual thus indicating that the budget had not been made use of as an
effective instrument of management control.
4. Systems and Controls
Deficiencies observed during the course of audit were brought to the notice of the Vice Chancellor of the University by my detailed report
issued in terms of Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance Act. Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control:-
(a) Human Resources Management,

charges to Telecom will be reduced.

(b) The Cash balance available due to the collection of several Self Financing Courses. The Self  Financing Courses are running
Courses within the stipulated period. Also the amount received from Bond obligation and Engowment Fund are included in
the balance and these have been transferred to the Fixed Deposits from time to time.
(c) The guest house available at the university has very little facilitates such as Air condition and other items. Professors and
other Officials are not willing to stay in this present condition. We are taking steps to improve the facilities.
(d) The number of unskilled labourers of the University has not been increased substantially to meet our needs in the last 25
years. Whereas the space and the infrastructures have been increased more than fourfold. Further nearly 1/3 of the vacancies
at the Maintenance Branch remain unfilled due to the procedural barriers. Since the available staff engaged with important and
urgent works only, this work being outsourced.
3:1:4 (a) Action is being to repair the Scooters.
(b) There was a delay in getting Cabinet approval for this project. But now after obtaining the Cabinet approval as well as
architectural approval is received, the 01st phase of the construction is now completed.
(c) Action has been taken to use the items mentioned in the report.
(d) There were some impediments in implementing this item. But now action has been taken towards this.
(e) The beds that were purchased for the use by out station students with additional private residential hostels. And now these
beds are being reserved for the re establishing Siddha Medicine hostels and for the additonal needs of the existing hostels.
3:1:6 (a) The delay is due to the revision of the plan due to the experience by the Nisha Floods and also due to the financial limitations.
Now we are proceeding with it.
(b) The University also regrettably admit this delay and given attention to complete this work and with frequent communication
with the Buildings Dept., Colombo and the changing environment of the country the completion of this contract is now in
progress.
(c) We were holding this money with CEB with depositive anticipation of the re-establishing our Faculty of Agriculture in
Kilinochchi. But now the prolong delay and the limitation of fund now this money has been transferred to another urgent
project of hostel (Medical Faculty) in 2010.
(d) Due to the adverse situation prevailed in North and due to lack of funds this was delayed. Now action is being taking to
recommence.
(e) This refers the answer given under 3.1.4 (b).
(f) IT networking project had been undertaken by the University of Colombo School of Computing under the SIDA IT
Networking Project. According to the terms and conditions the University of Jaffna had to meet the payment of V AT.
Accordingly the University paid Rs. 1,323,071.10 as V AT to the Enterprise Technology (Pvt) Ltd who is the Contractor
assigned the contract by the University of Colombo School of Computing. Further University of Jaffna had not paid
Rs. 8,820,474 to the University of Colombo School Computing. This amount was paid by the University of Colombo
School of Computing to the contractor. The project report from the University of Colombo School of Computing can be
obtained for verification.
In fact as we referred in the answer 3.3.3 (a) This project is being delayed due to the prevailing situation and the contractors.
Now with the change of environment this project is being activated and nearing completion.
(g) The Contract being changed due to the unavoidable situation faced by the Contractor and now with the change of contractor
the work is in progress.
3:2 ( a) The permanent teaching staff are involved in Faculty as well as interfacully teaching without any additional remuneration
other than their salaries. When the teaching load of a teacher in his/her departments/Faculty is far in excess of the approved
academic norms of a particular academic position, payment is made by appointing them as visiting lecturers for the lectures
They take out side their academic norms in departments out side the faculty to which they belong to. Only a small number
of such visiting appointments are made under inevitable circumstances.

Cadres are determined by the University Grants Commission based on the needs of each Faculty. Further although the title
of the “Field of Study” may look alike, the scope of the course and the courses contents are varied. In few other occasions
eminent persons of a particular field also invited as visiting Professors.
(b) The temporary posts in Assistant Lecturer, Tutor, Demonstarator and instructors are regularly advertised before the
commencement of every academic year and recruitment is made by following the proper recruitment procedure.
However when an appointed person resigns or leaves the service during an academic year and when there is no adequate
time to fill the vacancy by advertisement, appointments are made on the request of the Head and the Dean in a very few
occasions, so as to carry out the academic programmers within the Scheduled academic calendar. Such appointments (a few)
are made only for the balance period of the appointments of the person resinged.
(c) We are very conscious in recruiting academic positions with excellence and every effort is being taken in this regard
according to the UGC regulations. In fact in certain disciplines in spite of our repeated advertisements, we are unable to find
appropriate candidates. In such circumstances we employed visiting or contract staff. This again only few instances. In this
regard we expect a conscious attention and clear understanding.
3:3 ( b) In some Faculties examinations are conducted at the end of the academic year. In some at the end of each semester. However
the results of the examinations conducted at the end of the first semester are released along with the result of the second
semester. This is the examinations regulations. This is because of the results are released for each semester, there is a
possibility of students skipping two out of five course units in the second semester. However the structures of the Degree
Programmed are changed now and for the new batches of students results are released within three months.
3:4 (a & b) In special occasions such as the candidate obtained valuable scholarship.
3:5  The following steps have been taken with regard to Budgetary Control.
(i) Budget is approved by the Finance Committee and the Council annually;
(ii) V ote Ledger is computerized in order to monitor the expenditure within the allocation;
(iii) Monthly Comparative statement (Budgeted amount-Actual Expenditure) is placed before the Finance Committee;
(iv) Sub imprest to the Vavuniya Campus is monitored by a separate votes ledger at the Finance Branch of the University.
