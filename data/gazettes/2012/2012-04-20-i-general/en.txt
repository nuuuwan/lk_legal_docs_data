No. 50/2, Sir James Peiris Mawatha,
Colombo 2.
REPORT OF THE AUDITOR
TO THE COUNCIL OF THE INSTITUTE
OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS OF SRI LANKA
Report on the Financial Statements
I have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of THE
INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS OF SRI
LANKA, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st December
2011 of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and the
Balance Sheets of F.B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie
Memorial Prize Fund, and the related Income Statements, and
Statement of Changes in Funds and Cash Flow Statement of the
Institute for the year then ended, and a Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and other explanatory Notes, as exhibited on
pages 51 to 64.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of these Financial Statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and
maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of Financial Statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates
that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial
Statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that I
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether
the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall Financial Statement presentation.
I have obtained all the information and explanations which to the
best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of
my audit. I, therefore, believe that my audit provides a reasonable
basis for my opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, the Institute
maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st
December 2011 for its activities, F.B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril
E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund and the financial statements give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Institute, F.B. Lander
Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st
December 2011 and the results of their operations and cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards.

<!-- page 18 -->

498 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2012'04'20
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 20.04.2012
(c) Functional and Presentation Currency
The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the institute’s functional and presentation currency.
Figures and phrases relating to the previous year have been restated where necessary, to conform to the current year’s
presentation.
(d) Use of Estimates and Judgements
The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with SLASs requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income & expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgemental decisions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
1.2 Assets and the bases of their valuation
1.2.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or impairment losses.
(b) Cost
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing the
asset to working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent expenditure incurred for the purpose of acquiring, extending or improving assets of a permanent nature in order
to carry on or increase the earning capacity of the Institute has been treated as capital expenditure.
(c) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on the written down values at the following rates per annum in order to
write off the cost of such assets over their estimated useful lives, except in the case of buildings on leasehold land, head
office refurbishment and computer software.
Generator 20%
Furniture and Equipment 10%
Air-Conditioning Equipment 20%
Audio Visual Equipment 10%
Motor Vehicles 20%
Computers 20%
Canteen Equipment 10%
Head Office Refurbishment 10%
Buildings on Leasehold Land have been depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as
held for sale and the date that the asset is de-recognised.
The residual values of the assets are re-assessed annually.
An item of property, plant & equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected
from its use. Any gain or loss on de-recognition of the assets is included in the Income Statement in the year the asset is de-
recognised.
1.2.2. Educational material - IRQUE Project
Assets acquired under this project are depreciated on the following bases:
(a) Cost of library books are written off on straight-line method over a period of 3 years.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 20.04.2012
(c) Cost of Multimedia English Learning Center (MELC) software is written off on straight-line method over a period of 4
years.
(d) Syllabus development cost is written off on straight-line method over a period of 3 years.
1.2.3 Intangible Assets
An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the
entity and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard 37 – Intangible
Assets. Accordingly, these assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses.
Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight-line method.
1.2.4 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in th e
ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on
weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing
location and condition.
Other inventory items are stated at the lower of cost and net replacement cost.
1.2.5 Receivables
Receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
1.2.6 Short Term Investments
(a) Investments in Government Securities
Investments in treasury bills, treasury bonds and repurchase agreements are stated at cost plus accrued interest up to the
year end.
(b) Investments in Fixed Deposits
Investments in fixed deposits are stated at cost plus accrued interest up to the year end.
1.2.7 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits at bank.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, which
has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
3. LIABILITIES & PROVISIONS
All known liabilities as at the balance sheet date are included in the financial statements and adequate provisions are made fo r
liabilities which are known to exist but the amount of which cannot be determined accurately.
Obligations payable on demand or within one year of the balance sheet date are treated as current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Liabilities payable after one year from the balance sheet date are treated as non-current liabilities in the balance sheet.
1.3.1 Accounting for Grants
Grants that compensate the Institute for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the income statement in the same period
in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Institute for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income
statement on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related asset.
1.3.2 Employee Benefits
(a) Provision for Retiring Gratuity
The Institute has adopted the benefit plan as required under the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 for all eligible
employees. The benefit plan is unfunded. Provision for gratuity is made by the Institute taking account of the recommendation
of an independent qualified actuaries firm, Messrs Actuarial & Management Consultants (Private) Limited. The actuarial
valuation was done for the first time in 2010.

<!-- page 20 -->

500 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2012'04'20
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 20.04.2012
Defined benefit plans define an amount of benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or
more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the balance sheet date together with adjustments for unrecognised past service cost. The defined benefit
obligation is calculated annually by the Institute using the projected unit credit method prescribed in Sri Lanka Accounting
Standard 16; Employee Benefits. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash flows using the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds that are denominated
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related
pension liability. In the absence of such high-quality long-term corporate bonds or government bonds, the long term
discount rate is determined by examining the market rate of interest on short-term corporate bonds and the anticipated long-
term rate of inflation.
Gains and losses arising from experience, adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to
income statement in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income statement,
unless the changes to the plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specific period of time (the vesting
period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The key assumptions used by Messrs Actuarial & Management Consultants (Private) Limited include the following:
• Rate of Interest 10% per annum
• Rate of Salary increase 5% - 10%
• Retirement Age 55 years
• The Institute will continue as a going concern
(b) Defined Contribution Plans
Obligations for contributions to a defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as
incurred.
The Institute contributes a sum not less than 15% and 3% of the gross emoluments of employees to Employees’ Provident
Fund (EPF) and to the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) respectively.
1.3.3 T axation
The profits and income of the Institute other than profits and income from dividends or interest is exempt from income tax under
Section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland Revenu Act, No. 10 of 2006.
1.3.4 Deferred Taxation
Provision has not been made for deferred tax, as profits and income of the Institute other than profits and income from dividends
or interest is exempt from income tax under Section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.
1.3.5 Capital Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
All material capital commitments and contingent liabilities are considered and necessary adjustments or disclosures are made in
the financial statements.
1.4 INCOME STA TEMENT
1.4.1 Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to Institute and that it can be reliably
measured.
(a) Enrolment fees from members and students are recognised as revenue on receipt. The subscription year runs 1 January to
31st December. Only those membership fees and subscription payments that are attributable to the current financial year
are recognised as revenue. Fees and subscription payments that relate to future periods are shown in the balance sheet as
subscriptions and fees received in advance under current liabilities.
(b) Fees on examinations, seminars, courses, and other educational and members’ activities are recognised as revenue on
completion of such activity.
(c) Interest income is recognised on accrual basis.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 20.04.2012
(d) Revenue from grants is recognised when control of the contribution or right to receive the contribution is confirmed.
(e) Sponsorship of member related activities is recognised on receipt.
(f) Other income is recognised on accrual basis.
1.4.2 Expenditure
(a) Expenses are recognised in the income statement on the basis of direct association between the cost incurred and the earning
of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the Institute and in maintaining the capital assets in
a state of efficiency has been charged to revenue in arriving at the surplus for the year.
(b) Expenditure on examinations, seminars, courses, and other educational and members’ activities is recognised in the income
statement on completion of such activity.
1.5 Comparative information
Where necessary, comparative figures have been re-arranged to conform with the current year’s presentation. Branch expenditures
amounting to Rs.4.7mn which had been classified under direct expenses of registration, education, training, library, and marketing
divisions have been re-classified and shown under employee costs and communication expenses.
1.6 Events after the balance sheet date
The materiality of events occurring after the Balance Sheet date has been considered and appropriate adjustments, wherever
necessary, have been made in the accounts.
