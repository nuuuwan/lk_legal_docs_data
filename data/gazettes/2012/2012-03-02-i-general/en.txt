Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at
31st March, 2011, and the Related Statements of Income and Expenditure and Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
2. Council’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Council is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards. This responsibility includes : designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of  financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error ; selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
3. In common with many organizations of similar size and organization, the Institute’s system of control is dependent upon the c lose
involvement of the Council Members. Therefore, where independent confirmation on the completeness of accounting was not
available, we have accepted assurances from the Council Members that all the Institute’s transactions  have been reflected in t he
books of accounts.
4. Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. These Standards, require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether

An audit includes examining, on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used  and significant estimates made by Management of the Institute, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes
of our audit.
We, therefore, believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
