other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards to obtain
reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. The audit includes the examination
on a test basis of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting policies used
and significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statements as well as evaluating their overall
presentation. I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary
for the purpose of my audit. I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
2. Financial Statments
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of opinion
that the Public Service Provident Fund had maintained proper according records for the year ended 31st December, 2010 and except
for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2:2 of this report, the financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Public
Service Provident Fund as at 31st December, 2010 and the financial results of its operations for the year then ended.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements
2:2:1 Accounting Deficiencies
Even though the unpaid bonus and interest that should have been credited to the Consolidated Fund in July of the year under
review amounted to Rs. 4,420,024, the Fund had credited a sum of Rs. 44,200,238. Accordingly a sum of Rs. 39,780,214 had
been over credited to the Consolidated Fund and that had been shown inappropriately in the balance sheet as prepayments.
Thus a sum of Rs. 364,652 had been under appropriated to the Government Bonus Contribution Account in the appropriation
of the profit for the year under review.
2:2:2 Accounts Receivable and Payable
The debit and credit balances that should have been settled through the other Ministries and Departments as at the end of the
year under review totalled Rs. 12,936,562 and Rs. 85,823 respectively.

3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Results
According to the Financial Statements presented, the financial results for the year under review before appropriate to the members

3:6 Operating Performance
The following observations are made.
(a) According to the Action Plan for the year 2010, the expected targets and the actual achievements of the activities of the Fund are
given below.
Activity Expected As at 31st December, 2010
Target Actual Percentage
Status
(i) Registratin of Contributors 8,000 5,768 72.17%
(ii) Collection of Contributions (Rs. Millions) 1,200 1,293 107.7%
(iii) Investment of Surplus Money (Rs. Millions) 4,000 3,616 90.4%
(iv) Payment of Benefits to Contributors (Rs. Millions) 160 400 250.0%
According to the above data, the expected targets had been achieved in 02 instances while the expected targets had been exceeded in 02
instances. It was observed that the target for the payment of benefits to the contributions had been set unrealistically.
(b) According to the Funds Management Analysis of the Financial Statements for the year under review, one of the 04 basic activities
directed towards the objectives of the fund had been stated as the maintenance of the members’ accounts in a manner to enable the
communication of the and balance of the member’s accounts to the members. Nevertheless, the individual accounts had not been
maintained in a manner to enable the communication of the year and balances as at the end of the year under review to the members.
Nevertheless, a Pilot Project in this connection had been commenced.
3:7 Management Weaknesses
According to Circulars No. 1/97 dated 31st July, 1997 and 14/2006 dated 30th October, 2006 of the Director General of Pensions, an
advices on the money credited to the Fund in each month should be forwarded by the respective institutions to the Secretary of the
Fund before the 15th day of the month following. Nevertheless, the progress relating to the year 2010 had been sent by the Fund to
get such advices to the Fund had not reached the expected level.
4. Systems and Controls
Differences in systems and controls observed during the course of audit were brought to the notices of the Director General of Pensions
from time to time. Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control.
(a) Collection of Abatement Registers
(b) Collection of Contributions
(c) Settlement of Erroneous Debit and Credit Balances
(d) Action on Audit Observations.
H. A. S. SAMARAWEERA,
Auditor General.
Observations of the Management Board of Public Service Provident Fund regarding the report of the Auditor General concerning
the accounts of Public Service Provident Fund for the year ending 31.12.2010.
2. Comments on Financial Statements
2:2:1 Accounting Deficiencies
This surplus remained during long period and generally an amount of 15 times of the compulsory contribution should be
credited to the Government bonus money. Reason for this surplus had been the delay to apply for the awards by members after
the termination of membership. However, as these awards are made only to the date on which the membership terminated, the
balance money kept remained in the account. The benefits of interests earned by investing the money is appropriated and
credited to the government bonus money again which caused to the increase of the surplus once more.

<!-- page 16 -->

1084 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2012'11'02
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 02.11.2012
Usually the unpaid bonus money of the awards is credited to the Consolidated Fund by the Treasury Account Summaries at
the year end. At the time when this difference was traced, there was no opportunity to submit supplementary account
summary for the year 2010 and it was ultimately shown as a previous payment in the final account. However this difference
would be adjusted when the unpaid bonus money of the year 2011 is credited to the Consolidated Fund. These amounts figured
in the accounts as this due to the unavailability of correcting the differences without adjusting with General Treasury Books.
2:2:2 Receivable and payable accounts
Despite frequent notices by letters and over the telephone to the concerned Departments and Ministries to settle the balances
remained over 5 years in the erroneous debits, was not taken any action to adhere the instructions. Therefore the above issues
could not rectify. However the action was taken to correct most erroneous debits of year 2010 within the year concerned.
There are no unsettled erroneous debits in year 2008, 2009, 2010 and it was already informed the authorities by letters and
telephone to settle the erroneous debits remained exceeding 4 years.
2:2:3 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
(a) Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance (Chapter 621) Section (2) 2
1. It has been difficult to make immediate corrections to these errors due to unavailability of proper maintenance of single
accounts from the beginning of the fund. However, steps have been taken to maintain single accounts under the
e-pension project.
2. Section 25
We are hopeful that this issue will be solved as the facility to inform balances to the members is available under the
already started pilot program of the e-pension project.
3. II (3) (b)
Agree. Noted to follow this during the forthcoming financial year.
3. Financial and operating review
3.2 Interest percentage of the members
The average contribution collection from year 1996 to year 2009 has been increased and comparing thereto the appropriated interest
percentage has been decreased due to the high phase of contribution collection over the revenue earned by the interest. Though it is
experienced a higher number of contribution collections, a physical money flowing process cannot be observed as the contributions
credited by monthly account summaries. Therefore the investment oportunities have been lessened and on the other hand the
reinvestments which made on maturity of past investments had to be done on a situation of less interest rate are also considera bly
affected to the decrease in the overall interest revenue. Accordingly the appropriated interest percentage also had been reduced.
3.3 The lost interest revenue of the Fund
Letters were sent to the Secretary to the Treasury informing the decrease in appropriated interest percentage due to not receip t of
imprest for government bonus and to settle the account balance of the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury after 2009 and also a
discussion in this regard was held with the patronage of Director General of Treasury Operations.
This was informed also to the Secretary to the Finance Ministry by latter dated 16.03.2009 but the money not received yet.
The statement that this had been happened due to lack of attempt to get remitted the necessary subscription from the Treasury is not
acceptable and would like to inform that we have taken all the necessary steps in this regard. However we have not received the money
yet.
3.4 Staff recourse
We have received more applications comparing to year 2003. However the number of staff in the carder has not grown. Even though
the additional officers attached to this division. the number of staff has been decreased to the previous level on account of officers’
retirements of each year. However at the moment we have attached additional 8 officers to mitigate the delay.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 02.11.2012
3.5 Benefit payments for members:
A huge increase in the number of applications to get benefits could observe during year 2008, 2009 and 2010 though there was no
increase in the number of staff comparing thereto which cause delay in the process. To overcome this difficulty and expedite th e
payments, we introduced a special project by attaching 8 officers temporarily. We hope that this delay would be minimized in due
course. Comparing to year 2009 the applications received have been dramatically increased by 9 times.
3.6 Operational performance:
(a) Though we expected 8000 registrations in the fund, the membership enrolment could be done on the basis of receipt of applications
only. Therefore it is difficult to achieve the expected targets as the membership registrations done on the basis of applicatio ns
received.
Further it is informed that the contribution collection has been exceeded the expected amount which is about 107%. Additional
money investment stepped to 90% due to pumping the money to pay benefits as the receiving applications has been exceeded the
expected targets. This artificiality immerged as a result of abundance in the number of applications received for awards and the
awards that made in year 2010.
(b) We are hopeful that we can overcome this issue as the facility is available under the already initiated pilot program of the e-pension
project.
3.7 Management weaknesses:
Even though the all departments and ministries were educated clalling credit notices by the circular 14/2006 dated 30.10.2006 in
addition to the circular 1/97, the institutions concerned have maintained a procedure of sending a list with cheques or different
manner without following the instructions in above circulars. As a result of these irresponsive conducts, the fund could not meet
with the expected targets of its productive implements. Having indentified these issues the Public Service Provident Fund has
introduced an instruction manual along with Circular 04/2010 dated 25.05.2010 and it is expected the fund would be achieved the
progress predicted. As the success of all these actions depends on the reactions of other institutions is has been difficult to achieve
the expected goals at some times.
