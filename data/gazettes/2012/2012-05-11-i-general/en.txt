3.1.1 Financial Result
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the Institute for the year under review had resulted in a deficit
of Rs. 1,928,183 before taking into account the Government Grants as compared with the corresponding deficit of Rs. 2,339,666
for the preceding year. The deficit for the year under review had reduced and showed a surplus of Rs. 826,455 after taking into
account to Government Grant of Rs. 2,748,000 received for recurrent expenditure and Rs. 6,638 received for rehabilitation while
the deficit for the preceeding year had reduced to Rs. 178,461 after taking into account the Government Grant of Rs. 2,018,500
received for the recurrent expenditure and Rs. 142,705 received for rehabilitation of that year.
3.1.2 Analytical Financial Review
A sum of Rs. 2,754,638 had been received as Government recurrent grant and Government rehabilitation recurrent grant and
the total expenditure amounting to Rs. 4,097,713 had been incurred by the Institute during the year under review.
(b) The Institute did not have adequate accommodation to maintain its office and presently it is housed in a building of the Open
University. The need for the procurrement of office accommodation had not been included in the Corporation Plan.
(c) According to the Corporate Plan, the Examination for the enrollment of students for the Postgraduate Diploma Course in
English Language Teaching, should have been planned in 2009 and students should have been enrolled in the year 2010.
Nevertheless it had not been implemented during the year under review.
3.2.4 Action Plan
The Action Plan also had not been updated in accordance with the needs. According to the Action Plan for the year 2010, 09
activities should have been implemented. But those had not been implemented during the year  under review.
3.2.5 Performance
(a) Even though a period exceeding 05 years had elapsed since the establishment of the Institute, the total number of students
registered so far stood at 100 and only one student had gained the postgraduate qualification in English Language Teaching
and English Education. Such performance is inadequate when compared to the expenditure incurred by the Government for
a period exceeding 05 years.

(b) Even though 77 students had been registered during the years 2006-2009, the number of students remaining at the Institute
by end of the year under review had been 28 only. Thus the number of students abandoning academic activities had been
at a high level of 48. The per centage of that was 62 per cent.
4. Systems and Controls
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control :-
