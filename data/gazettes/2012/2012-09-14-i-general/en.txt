INDEPENDENT  AUDITORS’  REPORT  TO  THE  MEMBERS  OF  SRI  LANKA  INSTITUTE  OF  TAXATION
Report on the Financial Statements :
We have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of Sri Lanka Institute of Taxation, which comprise the Balance Sheet as
at 31st March, 2012 and the Related statements of Income and Expenditure and Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and a summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory Notes as set out on pages (5) to (14).
Council’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements :
Council is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation a nd fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate
accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
3. In common with many organizations of similar size and organization, the Institute’s system of control is dependent upon the
close involvement of the Council Members. Therefore, where independent confirmation on the completeness of accounting was not available,
we have accepted assurances from the Council Members that all the Institute’s transactions have been reflected in the books of accounts.
4. Scope of Audit and Basis of Opinion :
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. These Standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurances whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by Management of the Institute, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.
We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes
of our audit.
We, therefore, believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Opinion :
In our opinion, so far as  appears from our examination, the Institute maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st
March, 2012, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Institute’s state of affairs as at 31st March, 2012, and its excess
of Income Over Expenditure for the year then ended, in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.
