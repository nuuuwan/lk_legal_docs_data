THE Audit of financial statements of the National Institute of Library and Information Sciences affiliated to the University of  Colombo
for the year ended 31st December, 2010 was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution
of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sections 108(1) and III of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978

Universities Act and Section 13(7)(a) of the Finance Act.
1:2 Responsibility of the Management for the Financial Statements :
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing from implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the

policies used and significant estimates made by the management in the preparation of financial statemetns as well as evaluating
their overall presentation. I have obtained sufficient information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belie f
were necessary for the purpose of my audit I therefore believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion Sub-sections
(3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the
scope and extent of the audit.
2. Financial Statements :
2:1 Opinion :
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of information and according to the explanations given to me. I am of opinion
that the National Institute of Library and Information sciences had maintained proper accounting records for the year ended 31st
December, 2010 and except for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2:2 of this report the
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the National Institute of Library and Information Sciences as at 31st December 2010 and the financial resul ts
of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended.
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2:2:1 Accounting Deficiencies :
The following observations are made :
(a) Fixed assets had been purchased in the year under review by utilizing a sum of Rs. 673,198 from the “Development Fund”
created by using a portion of the course fees collected up to the year 2008 which should have been credited to the income
of the Institute contrary to Section 99 of the Universities Act, No. 16 fo 1978 and the letter No. UGC/FA/GH/2002 of the
Chairman of the University Grants Commission dated 13th January, 2003. The value thereof had been credited to the
“Government Capital Grants Account” instead of adjusting to the General Reserve.
(b) Income amounting to Rs. 16,710 receivable in the year under review in connection with the Intermediate Certificate in Library
and Information Management Course 09 had been shown as a set off to the course income received in advance.
2:2:2 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions :
The Quarterly Performance Reports had not been prepared in terms of Section 4:2:6 of the Public Enterprises Circular No. PED/
12 of 02nd June, 2003.
3. Financial and Operating Review :
3:1 Financial Review :
3:1:1 Financial Results :
According to the financial statements presented the working of the Institute for the year ended 31st December, 2010 had resulted
in a deficit of Rs. 8,430,218 before taking into account the  Government Grant for recurrent expenditure as compared with the
corresponding deficit of Rs. 7,670,113 for the preciding year. The deficit for the year under review had been reduced to Rs. 2,575,218
after taking into account the Government grant of Rs. 5,855,000 received for the recurrent expenditure for the year under review.
The deficit for the preceding year had been reduced to Rs. 2,173,113 after taking into account the Government grant of Rs. 5,497,000
received for the recurrent expenditure of that year.
3:2 Operating Review :
3:2:1 Performance :
The following observations are made :
(a) The primary objective of the National Institute of Library and Information Sciences established under the aid from the
Second General Education Project of the World Bank is the training of between 300 - 400 students per annum. Nevertheless,
the number of students registered since the commencement of the course in the year 2003 to the year 2010 was less than
that and a considerable number of them had not successfully completed the courses.

Auditor General,
Auditor General’s Department,
Independence Square,
Colombo 07.
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the National Institute of Library and Information Sciences
affiliated to the University of Colombo for the year ended 31st December, 2010 in terms of Section 108 (2) of the
Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Section 13 (7) (a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971
This has reference to your Audit report No. CE/G/NILIS/FA/10 dated 18th July, 2011 on the Accounts of this Institute.
I submit herewith my observations on the above Audit Report as follows :
2:2 Comments on Financial Statements :
2:2:1 Accounting Deficiences
(a) Corrected by putting Journal Entry No. 01 dated 02.09.2011,
(b) The sum of Rs. 16,710 has been errorneously shown under current assets instead of showing under current liabilities. We
would take necessary action to minimize this kind of presentation errors in preparing Financial Statements in future.
2:2:2 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions
Quarterly Performance Reports have already been prepared.
3.2 Operating Review :
3.2.1 Performance
(a) Teacher Librarians are reluctant to register for our courses as their professional qualifications acquired by following our
courses are not recognized and not included in the Teachers Service Constitution as agreed by Ministry of Education in 2008.
Ministry of Education should take up the full responsibility in this regard as pointed out at the last COPE Meeting.
Certain students have not completed the courses for which they have registered for. The main reason for this is that, they
have not submitted the thesis reports on due dates, as a result we have not been able to issue certificates on behalf of them
and we have reminded this matter to them by sending several reminders.
(b) We have taken initial steps to implement all activities except (ii) and (v) mentioned in the Audit Report. NILIS Symphosium
2011 was held on 01st August, 2011.
Only two academic members are there in our Academic Staff. Therefore they have not been able to involve in research work
directly, but by means of research work handled by students our academic staff make a considerable contribution to make
them success.
Due to limited number in Academic staff and limited ICT facilities available, implementation of Distance Education
Programmes has become somewhat difficult.
(c) After completion of Courses additional time is required to conduct exams., paper marking, Preparation of Project Reports,
Examine Project Reports, obtain approval of Board of Management for results etc., Therefore Courses cannot be completed
within stipulated period.
3.3 Management Inefficiencies :
3.3.1 Tsunami Programme
(a) As the schools at Tsunami affected areas had received excess books in 2008-2010 period, we have been instructed to suspend
the distribution of books during that period. We have spent Rs. 250,695.73 out of this fund in year 2011 to give financial
assistance to schools to buy books. We have requested from other selected schools to submit quotations from book shops
from where they expect to buy books. We have sent number of reminders too to these schools.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 13.01.2012
3:3:2 Stocks and Fixed Assets Control :
(a) The stock book had been balanced at the year end and brought forwarded as 2011 opening balance, But inadvertently the entries
relevant to closure of books had not been done. We have corrected this error by now.
(b) Dates of conducting Board of Survey would be mentioned in the appointment letters issued for Board of Survey 2011.
(c) We would maintain relevant registeres in proper manner for Fixed Assets acquired in future.
(d) The Survey of Books and periodicals already started and substantial part has been completed.
(e) The price of these seven monitors cannot be found separately, as the supplier had quoted prices for the entire computer and
not for separate parts of the computers. The relevant computers to which these monitors belong to are fully depreciated. Even
if the current market value of a monitor is considered, non elimination of cost and accumulated depreciation has no significant
effect to final accounts.
Once the other parts of the relevant computers are sold we would take necessary action to eliminate cost and accumulated
depreciation of those computers.
(f) We have already taken necessary action to sell, repair or destroy relevant items.
3.3.3 Financial Control :
(a) In complying with paragraph 395 (h) of Financial Regulations, Bank Reconciliation Statement is prepared by a different person
doesn’t involve with other financial activities.
(b) All receipts are entered in the cash book.
(c) At present no cheques written without adequate funds.
(d) All these money orders had been realized by now.
3.4 Transactions without adequate authority  :
(a) These payments had been made in accordance with UGC Chairman’s letter UGC/HR/3/9/480 dated 24.03.2005. But UGC had
instructed to discontinue this payment with effect from 01.05.2011, by issuing the UGC Commission Circular 955, dated
28.04.2011. Therefore no such payment made after 01.05.2011.
(b) These payments had been made in accordance with UGC Establishment Circular Letter 06/2003 dated 05.06.2003.
3.5 Corporate Plan and Action Plan :
We have prepared the Corporate Plan and the Action Plan according to the Format specified in the PED/12 of 2nd June, 2003.
3.6 Budgetary Control :
Budgets are prepared in order to match the budgeted expenditure with actual expenditure. Steps have been taken to minimize
variations as far as possible.
4. Systems and Controls  :
We have drawn a special attention to avoid deficiencies pertaining to relevant areas of systems and controls.
