Vice-Chancellor,
Eastern University, Sri Lanka.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements of the Eastern university, Sri Lanka for the year ended 
31 December, 2019 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.
1. financial Statements 
 1.1 Qualified Opinion
  the audit of the financial Statements of the Eastern University , Sri Lanka (“University”) for the year ended 31st 
December, 2019 comprising the statement of financial positions as at 31st December, 2019 and the statement of 
financial performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under my 
direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of 
Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 107(5) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and provisions of the 
National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the 
Annual Report of the University in terms of Section 108 (1) of the Universities Act appear in this report. My report 
to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course.
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my report, 
the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the University as at 31st 
December, 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 (a) the disclosure relating to the fully depreciated Property, Plant and Equipment of the university as at 31 December 
of the year under review cost of Rs. 468,015,255 and belonging to 20 items, had not been made in the financial 
statements as per section 42 (b) of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard (SLPSAS) - 7. As well, the 
estimated error of the useful life of those assets had not been corrected according to the requirement of the SLPSAS 
- 3 with respect to show the fair value of those assets in the financial statements.  
 (b) According to section 72 of the SLPSAS, the land and building are accounted for separately even when they acquired 
together. however, the value of the lands and buildings of the University as at end of the year under review had been 
shown together as Rs. 1,707 million without being shown their values separately in the financial statements. 
 (c) Even though depreciation expenditure for part of the Property, Plant and Equipment of the University for the 
year under review amounted to Rs. 14,704,390, the depreciation expenditure charged to the statement of financial 
performance for those assets amounted to Rs. 64,735,341. As a result, the deficit for the year under review had been 
overstated by Rs. 50,030,095.  
 (d) Out of the total cash and cash equivalent balance shown in the cash flow statement amounting to Rs 526,283,741, 
evidence relating to cash and cash equivalents amounting to Rs 3,048,236 had not been made available for audit.

 (e) Even though thirteen legal cases had been filed at the courts by the various parties against the university claiming 
compensation amounting to Rs. 504,574,803, the details relating to the contingent liabilities thereon had not been 
disclosed in the financial statements of the year under review as per SLPSAS - 8. 
  i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under those
