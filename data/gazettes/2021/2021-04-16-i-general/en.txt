Report on the Audit of the financial Statements 
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of S W R D Bandaranaike National Memorial foundation (“the foundation”), 
which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019, and the statement of income and expenditure, 
statement of changes in funds, statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies.
in our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the foundation 
as at 31 December 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SLfRS for SMEs).
basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the foundation in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of 
Ethics) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

information.

Statement of financial Position as at 31st December
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
Responsibilities of management and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
the Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with SLfRS for SMEs, and for such internal control as Board of Management determines is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, Board of Management is responsible for assessing the foundation’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless Board of Management either intends to liquidate the foundation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the foundation’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at Sri Lanka 
Accounting and Auditing Standards website at: http://slaasc.com/auditing/auditorsresponsibility.php. this description

inflationary factors in the financial statements.
 ( b) functional and presentation currency
  these financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the foundation’s functional 
currency.
 ( c) use of estimates and judgements
  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with SLfRS for SMEs requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which 
form the basis of making the judgment about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
  the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only the financial year or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future financial years.
1.3   Significant accounting policies
the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements.
	( a) foreign currency transactions

transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to 
rupees at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the reporting date. foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognized in the statement of income and expenditure.
 ( b) Property, plant and equipment
 (i) Recognition and measurement
  items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
  Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and bringing the assets to its 
working condition.
  Gains/losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within “other 
income” in the statement of income and expenditure.
 (ii) Depreciation
  Depreciation is recognized in the statement of income and expenditure on a straight-line method for S W R D 
Bandaranaike National Memorial foundation and CHOGM fund over the estimated useful lives of the asset.

remaining balance of the liability for each period.
