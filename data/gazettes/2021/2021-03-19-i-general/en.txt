 1.3 Responsibilities of management and those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statement that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as management determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
  in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the institute ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the institute or to cease operations or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
  those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the institute financial reporting process.
  As per Section 16 (1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the institute is required to maintain proper books 
and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to 
be prepared of the institute.
 1.4 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements.
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assuarance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. i exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional septicism throughout the audit. i also.
 • ldentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. whether due to fraud or error. design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
tor one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions. misrepresentations, or 
the override or internal control.
 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness or the lnstitute’s internal 
control.
 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
 • Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainly exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the institute ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that a material uncertainly exists. i am 
required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of my auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the institute to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.

Vice Chancellor,
University of Jaffna.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements  and  Other Legal  and Regulatory Requirements of 
the university of Jaffna for the year ended 31st  December,  2019 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act,  
No. 19 of  2018
 
1. financial Statements  
 1.1 Opinion  
  the audit of the financial statements of the University  of Jaffna (“University”)  for the year ended 31st December, 2019 
comprising the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2019 and the statement of financial performance, 
statement of  changes  in  equity  and  cash  flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial 
statements,  including a summary of significant accounting  policies,  was  carried   out  under  my  direction   in   
pursuance  of  provisions  in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka  read  
in  conjunction with  provisions of the National  Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 and  Section  107(5) of the  Universities Act, 
No. 16 of 1978. My comments  and  observations  which  i  consider  should  be  published  with the Annual Report of  
the  University in   terms  or Sub-section 108(i)  of  the Universities Act appear in this report. My report to Parliament 
in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(6) of the Constitution  will be tabled in due course.
  in my opinion, the accompanying financial  statements  give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
University as at 31st December, 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended  in  
accordance  with  Sri  Lanka  Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 basis for Opinion  
  i  conducted  my  audit  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lanka  Auditing   Standards (SLAuSs).  My responsibilities, under  
those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements 
section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for my opinion.
 1.3 Responsibilities of management and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
  in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the University’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
  those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.
  As per Section 16 (1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the University is required to maintain proper books 
and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to 
be prepared of the University.
 1.4 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assuarance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri Lanka

Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also, 
 • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to desing audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control.
 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 • Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the University’s ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, i am required to draw attention in my report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of my auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the University to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
  i communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that i identify during my audit.
2. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
  National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 includes specific provisions for following requirements.
 • i have obtained all the information and explanation that required for the audit and as far as appears from my
