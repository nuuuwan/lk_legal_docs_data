your doubts cleared. Failure to do so may result in your candidature for the 
subject being cancelled.

 (vii)  the left-hand margin of the answer sheet is set apart for you to enter 
the number of the question you answer. the right hand margin is reserved

answers correctly as incorrect numbering leads to confusion.

question paper, with regard to the compulsory questions and the manner in 
which the other questions should be selected. Disregard to these instructions

accurate and sufficiently large. In an  answer running into serveral pages if

to do so may result in the loss of your script and your being treated as an 
absentee for the paper. On no account should your script be handed over to 
a peon or an attendant.
 (xii)  if it becomes necessary for you to speak to the Supervisor or an 
invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise your 
hand.
