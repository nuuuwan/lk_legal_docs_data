Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increase the future economic benefits embodied in the 
assets. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
 
  All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life and amortized using straight line method to write 
down the cost of intangible asset to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows.
  a. Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight-line basis.                                
  b. Cost of development of new curriculum is amortised over a period of 5 years on                                
 
  Straight-line basis from the effective date of the new curriculum.

software purchased by the entity.
