Vice Chancellor,
Eastern university of Sri Lanka
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements of the Eastern university of Sri Lanka for the 
year ended 31st December, 2017 in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
tHE audit of financial statements of the Eastern university of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December, 2017 comprising 
the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2017 and the statement of financial performance, statement of 
changes in equity and statement of cash flows and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the 
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sub-section 107 (5) of the universities Act, No. 16 
of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the Annual Report of the university in 
terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act appear in this report.
 1.2 management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  the management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the managment determines is

necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due 
to fraud or error.
 1.3 Auditor’s Responsibility
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit 
in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Auditing Standards of Supreme 
Audit institutions (iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statments. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the 
finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of 
the audit.
  i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. financial Statements
 2.1 Qualified Opinion
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described 2.2 of this report, the financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the financial position of the Eastern university of Sri Lanka as at 31st December, 2017 
and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector 
Accounting Standards.
