Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the University of Jaffna for the year ended 31st 
December, 2017 in terms  of Section 108 (1) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
the audit of financial statements of the university of jaffna (“the university”) for the year ended 31 December, 2017 
comprising the statement of financial position as at 31 December, 2017 and the statement of financial performance, statement 
of changes in net assets and statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the 
Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 107(5) of the universities 
Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the Annual Report of 
the university in terms of Sub-section 108(1) of the universities Act appear in this report. A Detailed report in terms of  
Sub-section 108(ii) of the universities Act issued to the Vice Chancellor of the university on 17th September, 2018.
 1.2 management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
 1.3 Auditor’s Responsibility
 
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Standards of Supreme Audit institutions 
(iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial  statements. Section 111 of the universities Act, No. 16 
of 1978 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope extend of the audit.
  i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified audit 
opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2  financial Statements
 2.1 Qualified Opinion
 
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university of jaffna as at 31 December 2017 and its financial 
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting 
Standards.

thereon had been made in the accounts.

without being recovered,

them between the periods ranging from 1 to 5 years.

Rs. 58,562,916.

3 Financial Review
 3.1 financial Results
  According to the financial statements presented, the operations of the university during the year under review had 
resulted in a deficit of Rs. 443,649,262 as compared with the corresponding deficit of Rs. 197,158,693 for the preceding 
year, thus indicating a further deterioration of Rs. 246,490,569 in the financial results for the year under review. the 
main reasons for this deterioration were increase of personal emoluments, contractual services and other operating 
expenses. 
  Even though the operations of the university during the year under review had resulted in a deficit of  
Rs. 443,649,262, the value addition of the university for the year under review was Rs. 1,898,387,724 after taking 
into account the personal emoluments, taxes paid to the Government and depreciation aggregating Rs. 2,342,036,986 
further, the value addition for the year under review had increased by Rs. 52,035,162 or 3 per cent as compared with 
previous year.
4 Operating Review
 4.1 Academic Performance
  the academic performance of the university during the year under review is as follows:
 (a) Results of Examinations
  According to the university Grants Commission Circular No. 636 of 14 july, 1995 results should be released 
within three months after the examinations. Nevertheless, the dates to hold the examinations for various courses 
conducted under each faculty of the university and target dates to release results of the examinations had not 
been determined. it was further observed that there were considerable period of delays in releasing the results of 
examinations ranging from 04 months to 12 months by the faculties of Arts, Management Studies and Commerce, 
Science, AHS unit / Medical Laboratory Science, AHS unit / Nursing, AHS unit / Pharmacy, and Post Graduate 
Diploma in Education of the university during the years 2017 and 2018. therefore, the students had been deprived 
to get their employment opportunities in time. Even this matter was pointed out in my previous year audit reports; 
meaningful actions had not been taken by the relevant authorities to release the results within three months after 
the examinations.
 (b) Library Administration
  Periodicals worth uSD 951,597 purchased in the previous years had not been received to the university even up 
to 05 October 2018.
 (c) Students Academic Programs
  four hundred and ninety one lecture hours relating to theoretical and practical sessions out of 1,847 hours had not 
been covered by the academic staff of the faculty of Agriculture for the year under review.
 (d) Ranking of the University
  According to the World Ranking published by the Webometrics, the university was ranked at 7th and 4506th 
places among the Sri Lankan universities and international universities respectively in the year 2017. in the 
 Reference to Rules, Regulations and  Non – compliance

meantime, it had secured the 08th and 5380th places in the previous year. However, further actions are needed to 
enhance the ranking of the university in locally and internationally.
