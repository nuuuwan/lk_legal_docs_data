the Vice Chancellor,
university of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements of the university of Colombo for the year ended  
31 December, 2017 in terms of Sub-section 108(1) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
tHE audit of financial statements of the university of Colombo for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprising the 
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes 
in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution 
of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 13 (1) of the finance Act, No.38 of 1971 
and Sub-section 107 (5) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My comments and observations which i consider should 
be published with the Annual Report of the university in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the universities Act, appear in this 
report.
 1.2   management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
 1.3 Auditor’s Responsibility
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with  Sri  Lanka  Auditing  Standards consistent with international  Auditing  Standards  of  Supreme  
Audit  institutions (iSSAi 1000 - 1810). those Standards require  that  i  comply  with  ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial  statements are free from material  
misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence  about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgements, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose  of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control.  An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Section 111 of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 
gives discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
  i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described  in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2.  financial Statements
 2.1 Qualified Opinion
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements 
give a true  and  fair view  of  the  financial  position of the university of Colombo as at 31st December, 2017 and its 
financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting  
Standards.
