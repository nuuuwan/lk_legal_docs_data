conjunction  with Sub-section  107(5)   and Section 108 of the Universities  Act, No. 16 of 1978.  My  comments  and  
observations  which  i consider  should  be published  with  the  Annual Report of the University in terms of Section 
108 (1) of the Universities Act appear in this report.
 1.2  Management's Responsibility for the financial Statements
  Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  financial statements  
in accordance  with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal  control  as the 
management  determines  is necessary  to enable  the preparation  of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatements whether due to fraud or error.
 1.3 Auditor's Responsibility
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit 
in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Auditing Standards of Supreme 
Audit institutions (iSSAi 1000- 181 0). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  are free from 
material misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgments, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatements of the financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error. in making   those risk 
assessments,  the auditor considers internal control relevant to the institute’s  preparation and fair presentation 
of the financial  statements   in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate   in  the circumstances,  
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  of the institute’s     internal  control.  An  
audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness   of accounting   policies   used   and  the  reasonableness   
of  accounting   estimates   made   by management ,  as well as evaluating  the overall  presentation  of financial  
statements.  Sub  Section (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the finance Act , No. 38 of 1971 gives discretionary 
powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
  i  believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for my audit 
opinion.

resulted  in a net  deficit  of  Rs.  4,637,623 as against  the  net  surplus  of Rs.6,486,866 for the preceding  year, 
thus indicating a deterioration of Rs. 11,124,489  in the  financial  results  during  the  year  under  review  as  
compared   with  the  preceding  year. increase  of personnel  emoluments and contractual  services  by  Rs.

 (b) Conducting  researches  by an  institute  will  help  to  upgrade  the  standard  of  that institute and it will be 
provided an immense contribution to the national economy as well.  Hence,  the  institute  had  allocated  a  
sum  of  Rs.  587,286  for  conducting researches  on behalf of 4 academic  staff. However,  they  were  not 
presented  their research proposals even up to the date of audit on 27th September,2018.

  According to the Establishment  Circular No. 15/2015 dated  17th November, 2015 of the University Grants 
Commission, the results of the examinations  conducted for the internal students should be released within 03 
months. However,  the results for the final examinations  conducted for the academic  year 2012/2013  of the 
institute  had been  released  with  the  delay  of  6  months.  this  practice  had  badly  affected  the student’s 
employment opportunities after passing out.

  the following observations are made.
 ( a) A sum of Rs. 7,951,181 had  remained  outstanding for more than one year from 03 officers as bond value for

not obtaining  valid securities from them.

be used to record the arrival and departure of the officers, if the  number  of officers  has exceeded  25. However,  
the institute  had not  used the finger scanners although there were 94 officers attached to the institute.
 ( c) Leave  register   of  non-academic   staff   had  not   been  properly   maintained   and supervised by the relevant 
executive officer.
 4.3  Personnel Administration
  the following observations are made.
 ( a) Post of senior lecturer and probationary lecturer in the Department of Visual and technological Art had 
remained vacant since 2013. However, this Department is conducting the academic activities with temporary 
assistant lecturers and visiting lecturers. Even though, this situation had affected to the academic activities of 
the students, the institute had not filled those vacancies even up to the date of audit on 27th September, 2018.
 ( b) the Post of Store Keeper had remained vacant since 02 July 2012. However , Store Keeper of the Eastern 
University had performed duties for the above post on acting basis without taking action to appoint a permanent 
officer for this post.
5.   Accountability and Good Governance
 5.1  Action Plan
  the  Action  Plan  prepared  by  the  institute  for  the  year  2017   had  not  included   the information  such  as  updated  
organizational  structure,  approved  and  actual  carder,  and internal audit plan in term of Section 4 of the Public 
finance Circular, No. 01 /2014 dated 17th february, 2014.
