the Vice Chancellor,
uva Wellassa university of Sri Lanka,
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements of the uva Wellassa university of Sri Lanka for the year 
ended 31st December, 2017 in terms of the Sub Section 108 (1) of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978
the audit of financial statements of the uva Wellassa university of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31st December, 2017 
comprising the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2017 and the statement of financial performance, statement 
of changes in equity and cash flow statement and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of Provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the 
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Sub -section 107(5) of the universities Act, No.16 of 
1978. My comments and observations which, i consider should be published with the Annual Report of the university in 
terms of Sub Section 108(1) of the universities Act appear in this report. A detailed report in terms of Sub-section 108(2) of 
the universities Act was issued to the Vice Chancellor of the university on 12th june, 2018.
 1.2 management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
 1.3 Auditor's Responsibility 
  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. i conducted my audit in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards consistent with international Auditing Standards of Supreme Audit 
institutions (iSSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the :financial statements are free from material misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
Statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal Control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Section 111 of the universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 
gives discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
  i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
 1.4 Basis for Qualified Opinion 
  My opinion is qualified based on the matters described in paragraph 2.2 of this report.
2. financial Statements
 2.1 Qualified Opinion
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in Paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the uva Wellassa university of Sri Lanka as at 31st December, 
2017 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector 
Accounting Standards.

 2.2.1 Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards
   the following observations are made:
 (a) Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 07
 (i) the useful life  of non-current  assets had  not been  reviewed  annually in  terms of paragraph 65 of the 
Standard. Even though fixed assets costing Rs. 227,574,903 had  been  fully depreciated, they had  still been  
in use.  As such, action had not been taken to revise the estimated error in terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector 
Accounting Standard  03.
 (ii)   in terms of paragraph 87 (c) of the Standard, the contracted value relating  to Work-in-Progress amounting 
to Rs. 127,300,391 indicated  in  the financial statements as at the end of the year under review, had not been 
disclosed in the financial statements.
 2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
  the  following observations are made: 
  
 ( a)  Even  though  it  had  been  identified  under  Accounting  Policies that all capital assets purchased under 
Government grants are accounted as a deferred income  during their useful life, a sum of Rs. 101,410,747 had 
been brought to account as  depreciation  in  the  year  under  review  for buildings constructed  under capital 
grants. Nevertheless, it had not been brought to account as deferred income.
 ( b) Provisions had not been made for audit fees payable for the preceding year and the year under review.
 ( c) Even though the amortization totalling Rs. 1,412,625 received as donation of equipment and library books under 
the Project on Higher Education for the twenty first Century Project relating to the year under review comprised 
of Rs. 1,404,609 and Rs.8,016 respectively, that value had  been shown   as Rs. 1,194,372 and as such, amortization 
had been understated by Rs. 218,253 .in accounts.
 ( d) A sum of Rs. 8,483,168 recoverable as ·at the end of the year under review from three lecturers who had breached 
agreements, had been shown in the financial statements as balances receivable and credited to the fund for Breach 
of Agreements instead of disclosing through notes on accounts.
 ( e) Even though the increase in the balance receivable shown  under  non current assets in the year under review had 
been Rs. 3,322,477, it had been shown as Rs.3,294,054 in the cash flow statement under changes in the working  
capital, thus observing a difference of Rs.28,423.
 ( f) fuel allowances of Rs. 122,790 paid in the year under review for the ensuing year had been brought to account as 
an expenditure of the year under review.
 ( g) A sum of Rs. 1,801,476 paid in the year under review for Project on Development of Alternative Roads for 
university Access - Phase ii had been written off as expenditure instead of showing under Work-in-Progress in 
the financial statements.
 ( h) the value of animals amounting to Rs. 221,889 on the farm maintained under the faculty of Zoology and Export 
Agriculture as at the end of the year under review, had not been included in the financial statements.

  those Standards require that i comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable

  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor

evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Section 111 of the universities Act, 
No. 16 of 1978 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.

institutions (1SSAi 1000-1810). those Standards require that 1 comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements arc free from material misstatements.
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the university’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. Section 111 of the universities Act, No. 16 of 
1978 gives discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
  1 believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
