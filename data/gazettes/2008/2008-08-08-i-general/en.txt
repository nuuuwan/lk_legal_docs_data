PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 08.08.2008
ended  31 December  2006  and except for the  effects on the  financial statements of the  matters referred to in  paragraph
2.2  of this  report,  the  financial  statements which  are in agreement  with  the said books  have been  prepared and presented
in  accordance with  Sri Lanka  Accounting  Standards and the  stated accounting  policies and the  Notes (No. 01 to 20)
to the  financial statements  and give  a true  and fair  view  of the financial position  of  the  University of  Sri Jayawardenapura
as  at  31st  December, 2006 and the financial results of  its  operations and the  cash  flows  for the  year then  ended.
2.2. Comments on Financial Statements
2.2. 1 Sri Lanka Accounting  Standards  :
The following non compliances with  Sri Lanka  Accounting  Standards  were  observed :
(a) Fully depreciated assets which are still being  used  had not been  revalued  and  brought to accounts
in terms  of Sri Lanka  Accounting  Standard  No. 18. Accordingly, Water Supply Scheme, Telephone
Board   and the  Electricity  Scheme the original cost  of which was  Rs. 14,056,745 represented  such
assets ;
(b) In addition buildings, motor vehicles, books, laboratory equipment,  office  equipment and cloaks
with  an accumulated depreciation  valued  at Rs. 735,499,868 had not been  revalued in terms  of
Sri Lanka  Accounting Standard No. 18.
The  Vice Chancellor informed me that  it is not possible to adopt  revaluation as  a policy as the
revaluation of assets involves heavy  expenditure.
2.2.2. Accounting  Deficiencies  :
The following  accounting deficiencies were  observed :
(a) Even though a sum of Rs. 10.4 million  had  been  shown in the  financial statements as  course fees
the total receipts during the year  according to the  classification registers of the  Faculty  of
Postgraduate Studies amounted  to Rs. 26 million ;
(b) The  accrual concept had not  been  adopted in accounting for  interest income on investments and
the  total interest received had been  brought to account under  income.
2.2.3. Accounts Receivable and Payable :
The  following observations are  made :
(a) Amounts due  to the University aggregating to Rs. 66,523,966 and amounts  payable by  the
University amounting  to Rs. 19,103,205 had not been confirmed by the relevant parties. No action
had  been taken  to settle those  amounts ;
(b) Action  had not  been  taken for the  recovery of  loan balances amounting to Rs. 2,582,800 remaining
without being  recovered over  a number  of years and to settle the over-recoveries  amounting  to
Rs. 55,089. The recovery of  loan instalments on loans granted    to certain officers  had  been  delayed.
Staff loan  balances  had  been understated by Rs. 14,540 and overstated by Rs. 2,290 during  the
year  under  review ;
(c) A proper register for  recording information on teachers proceeding  abroad scholarships on
academic leave had  not been  maintained. The  number  of  teachers who  had proceeded abroad
in such  manner and breached the  agreements by not  reporting for  service after the expiry of  the
specified   period  stood  at 43  and a sum  of  Rs. 36,250,676 was due  to the  University from  them
for the  breach of agreements. An adequate course of action had   not been  taken for  the recovery
of such  amounts.

connection.
(b) The  estimates of income and  expenditure of the Masters Course in Multidiscipline and Technology
Conducted  on fee  charging basis  had been  prepared to result in a saving   of 22  per cent. Even
though the savings  of  the preceding years should  have been  credited  to the University Fund,
it had  not been  done  so and  a sum of Rs 668,228 out of that  had been  utilized for  the purchase
of a  mechanical stability  machine during the year under  review.
3.  Financial and  Operating  Review :
3.1 Financial Review
3: 1.1.Financial Results
According  to the  financial statements presented the working of  the University for   the  year  ended 31st
December, 2006  had resulted in a deficit of Rs. 908,325,284  before taking into  account  the Government
grant for recurrent expenditure as   compared with   the corresponding  deficit of Rs. 698,633,139 for the
preceding  year. Due to the Government grant amounting  to Rs. 827,649,735 received  for  recurrent
expenditure of  the  year under review the deficit was reduced to Rs. 80,675,549 and due to the Government
grant amounting to Rs. 661,066,382 received for recurrent expenditure of the  preceding  year  the  deficit
of  that  year  was reduced to Rs. 37,566,757. In addition to the Government grant, other   income  of
Rs. 63.7 million representing an increase of Rs. 37.4  million or 70 per cent over  the preceding year had

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 08.08.2008
(d) The number of students registered in the  External Examinations Division in the  year  2006 stood
at 13,555 while its  income  amounted to Rs. 47,029,569. Nevertheless the marking of the  answer
scripts of external examinations  had taken  11 months.
(e) All Faculties except the Medical Faculty had taken more than  6 months  for marking  of answer scripts
of internal examinations, thus  revealing a delay in the  release  of results.
(f) The  academic staff  of the University comprised  432  members and 83  of them had been  on sabbatical
leave or academic leave.
3:2:2  Performance on Examinations :

elapsed the Examiners had  not  submitted  the reports even up to 31st December  2006. Details appear
below.
Examination Assignment Faculty Date of Submission
of  Final Report
ASP/06/Re/2000/01 Management Studies April 2006
and  Commerce
ASP/06/Re/2000/01 Applied Science October  2006

ASP/06/Re/2004/06 do January 2006
ASP/06/Re/2005/12 do October 2006
(b) Even though an interim report  once in three months  and a half  yearly report once in every 6 months
should be furnished to the  Committee by the  lecturers after  the commencement of research works,
it had  not been  done so.
3:2:3. Hostel Administration :
(a) A large number of unauthorized students  are  occupying the hostels and as a result,  the registered
students could not obtain at least the minimum facilities. In  view of this position the University had to
incur a heavy expenditure to maintain the hostels.
(b) Fourteen houses had been taken on lease rent basis  from private parties to provide hostel facilities to
543  students and a sum  of Rs. 5, 391,000 had  been  paid  during the  year under review as lease rent.
Accordingly the annual average cost  per  student amounted to Rs. 9,928.
3:3 Mangement Inefficiencies

of action on the publication of the annual reports from  the  year  1995  to 2003 and on  the  recovery of
compensation from the teachers who had breached agreements. Nevetheless the work  completed had
been limited only to the handing  over  of the annual reports up to the  year 2004  for  printing and the
finalization of the annual report for the  year 2005.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 08.08.2008
(b) Delays in the  settlement of advances for research works were  observed and  a sum of Rs. 103,000 had
not been  settled  as at 31 December  2006. Out  of that, a sum of Rs. 75,000 was  due from a teacher who
had resigned from service.
(c) Audit examinations  revealed major  deficiencies  such  as the failure to file  adequate documents to
establish the correct value in  the  computation of  bond  value in the  event breaching  the  agreements,
failure to taken  adequate and speedy action for  recovery of compensation deciding on recovery of
compensation in instalments and lack of proper follow up action on the  recovery in instalments.
(d) Out  of a sum of Rs. 3.5 million received under  the Project for Training of Daham Pasel Teachers commenced
in the year  2004, a sum of Rs. 131,149 had been  spent. An examination of the progress thereon revealed
that even after the elapse of two years the Project work  is carried out at a very  slow  pace.
(e) Although a sum of  Rs. 24  million had been  paid  up to the year  1998 in three  instances in respect of
the  acquisition of the land  ‘“Meth  Sevana” for the Faculty  of Medicine of the University the land  had
not been  acuquired by the  University. The following  observations are made  in this  connection.
(i) The Western Provincial Council had  increased the value of that  land up to Rs. 80 million for  its
acquisition. The reason for  this  had  been  an attempt made  to acquire the land  without a proper
plan  and entering into agreement.
(ii) The  sum of Rs. 24  million paid  to the Western Provincial  Council had been shown in the accounts
under the current assets as well as current liablilities.
(f) The  balance shown  under the Trade and other  Advances in  the  year under  review  included  a balance
of Rs. 1,070,154  brought forward over  a period  exceeding  5 years without taking  action  for  its  recovery.
3:4 Contract Administration :
The  failure to complete the contracts awarded to external contractors within the agreed periods had been a
regular feature. The reasons adduced for extension of contract periods had been  inadequate and  most  of the
delays had been due  to the weaknesses of the  institution.
3.5 Idle and Underutilized  Assets :
The following observations are  made.
(a) A land  41.3 perches in extent purchased for  Rs. 1.6  million  for the  construction of a hostel to provide
facilities to 300 students had not been  utilized for any purpose whatsoever  up to the  end  of the year
under  review.
(b) Even  though a sum of Rs. 940,188 had been  spent in the  year  2001 as capital advances on the  Project
for the  disposal of sewage it had  not been  carried out even  up to the  end  for the year  2006. A consultation
fee of  Rs. 2,070,000 had  been  paid  to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board even  during  the
year  unde review.

3:6 Irregular Transactions :
The  following  observations are made.
(a) In terms of Section  99 of Part  xii of the Universities Act, No 16 of 1978, money received by the  University
from  whatever  source should  be credited to the University Fund. Ultra Vires such  provisions, a Fund
called  Vice Chancellor’s Fund  had been  established with  effect from  the  year  1995   on the  approval
of the Board  of Governors  of the  University and expenditure on the  welfare of various individuals  had
been  incurred there  from. The  opening balance as  at 01 January  2006 amounted to Rs. 1,237,614 and
such  expenditure incurred   during  the year  under  review  amounted to Rs. 338,566.
(b) A sum of Rs. 595,848 had been  spent out  of the  University Fund on the approval of the  Board  of Governors,
in connection with  the foreign tour of retired Professor and a Professor serving on contract basis  attached
to two  projects implemented under  the  SIDA – SAREC Programme.
(c) A sum of Rs. 1,310,000 had been  paid  on 17 February  1999 without  an agreement  to the  Pradeshiya
Sabha  for the  construction  of a drains system for  draining  of rainwater in  the  University. Nevertheless,
the University had not taken action to get  the work  done  or to recover the money even after  the elapse
of 8 years.
3.7 Matters of Contentious  Nature :
A sum of Rs. 70,344 had been  paid  as salary and  allowances to a University teacher  while serving as a  Director
of another institution. A sum of Rs. 170,310 had  been  paid to another University teacher  in respect of a period
of 3 months during  which he had not  served the University.
3:8 Annual Reports :
The  draft annual report for the   year under  review had not been furnished to audit.
3.  Systems and  Controls
Deficiencies in systems and controls observed during the course of audit were  brought to the notice of the vice
Chancellor of the  University from  time  to time. Special attention is needed in respect of the  following areas  of control.
(a) Fixed Assets
(b) External Courses
(c) Breach of Agreements and Bonds
(d) Constructions
(e) Examination Activities
