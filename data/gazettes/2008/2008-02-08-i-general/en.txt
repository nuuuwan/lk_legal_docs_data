available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, methods and practices to
obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of meterial misstatements. The audit included
examination of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in financial statements and assessment of accounting
principles and significant estimates and judgements made in the preparation of financial statements, evaluation of their
overall presentation and determining whether accounting policies adopted were appropriate, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
2. Accounts
2.1 Rendition of Accounts.– Although the annual accounts should be rendered to audit before 30th April of the following year
in terms of Tresuary Circular No. 836 of 16th August, 1977, the accounts of the Fund for the year ended 31st December,
2004 were rendered to audit on 07th August, 2006 after a delay of one year and 3 months.
2.2 Audit Opinion.– Except for the effects of the adjustments arising from the matters referred to in paragraph 2.3 of this
report, I am of opinion so far as appears from my examination and to the best of my information and according to the
expianation given to me that the financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting  principles and accounting policies set out in notes No.4 and give a true and fair view of the financial
position of the Fund as at 31st December, 2004 and the financial results and cash flow for the year then ended.
2.3 Comments on Accounts :
2.3.1  Accounting Deficiencies.– The Following accounting deficiencies were observed
(a) Tax amounting to Rs.12,366,029 payable on Investment Income for the year under review had not been taken into
consideration in preparing the accounts for the year under review while tax amounting to Rs.10,860,504 paid on
Investment Income for the preceding year had been accounted as expenditure for the year under review.
(b) The Interest Income for the year under review had been overstated by a sum of Rs.509,340 as a result, surplus for
the year had been overstated by a similar amount.
(c) Investment income amounting to Rs.4,584,060 received during the year 2003 had been treated as income for the year
under reveiw. The tax amounting to Rs.509,340 paid thereon had been shown as expenditure for the year. As a result,
surplus for the year had been undersated by a similar amount.
(d) The erroneous credit balance after setting off erroneous debits and credits, amounted to Rs.2,794,066 as at 01st
January, 1990. According to the final accounts presented from 1990 to 2004, a sum of Rs. 52,450,286,664 and
Rs.52,439,120,527 respectively had been shown separately as total erroneous debits and credits. A register had not
been maintained in respect of this. The balances had been shown in the accounts as an erroneous debit balance of
Rs.8,372,071 as at 31 December, 2004 after setting off erroneous debit and credit balances. It was observed that
effective action had not been taken to settle the erroneous debit and credit balances.
2.3.2 Obtaining Debit and Credit Advices :
According to Section 04 of the Public Service Provident Fund Circular No. 1/97 dated 31st July, 1997 of the Department
of Pensions, the respective institutions should send  advices relating to debits and credits to the Fund each month to the
Secretary to the Fund before the 15th day of the succeeding month. However, only two institutions had sent these advices
for the year under review. An efficient and effective action had not been taken even during the year under  review too
as previous years to obtain these advices.
2.3.3 Payment of Contributions :
Instances were observed where Contributions had been paid based on abatements records certified and sent at times.
Whilst the detailed obatement records had not been submitted to the fund. Therefore, in could not be satisfied in audit
of the correctness of these payment.
2.3.4 Lack of Evidence for Audit :
Although there are about 289 institutions under Provincial Councils, only 57 files had been furnished to audit for
examination of contributions received relating to the year 2004. Records had not been maintained to identify separately
the  institutions by names and the number of institutions that should sent the contributions. Files had been maintained
only in respect of the institutions that send the contributions. Therefore it could be ascertained in audit, the contributions
receivable  and the bonus receivable thereon.

2.3.5 Interest Paid in Making Payment of Contributions :
It was observed at the examination of accounts that there had been delays often in making payment of contributions and
bonus by the institutions under Provincial Concils. But, at making refunds, interest is calculated treating that the
contributions has been received  promptly without taking into consideration the actual date of receipt. Therefore, it was
observed that interests and paid out of the Fund for contributions that had been received.
3. Financial and Operating Review :
3.1 Financial Results
According to the accounts presented, the financial results for the year under review was a surplus of Rs.974,530,714,
while the financial results was a surplus of Rs. 8,250,877 after appropriation. The corresponding financial results for
the preceding year, was a surplus of Rs. 864,186,258 while the financial results was a surplus of Rs.1,219,923 after
appropriation thus indicating an increase of financial results after appropriation by Rs.7,030,954 as compared with the
preceding year.
3.2 Informing the Balances of the Members Accounts to the Contributors
According to Section 25 of the Public Service Provident Fund Act, the Director of Pensions should inform the contributors
after the close of the financial year, the balances of the members accounts prevailed as at 31st December. Although the
total number of members of the Fund as at 31st December, 2004 was Rs. 173,002, it was intimated to me that balances
as at 31st December, 2004 had been prepared only in respect of Rs. 35,000 Officers of the Reserve Police. Action had
not been taken to inform the year and balances to the members for over several years due to non-receipt of abatement
registers and non-maintenance of updated accounts separately for each contributor. However, updated registers of
members had not been maintained to identify separately the active members and in-active members.
3.3 Budgetary Control
The budget for the year 2004 furnished to audit on 12 March 2004 had not been prepared and presented in terms of
Paragraph 4 of the Treasury Circular No.836 of 16 August 1977.
4. Systems and Controls :
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control.
(a) Obtaining abatement registers
(b) Obtaining contributions.
(c) Maintenance of registers, books and records including the Cash Book
(d) Settlement of erroneous debit and credit balances.

Auditor General.
 OBSERVATION  OF  THE  PSPF MANAGEMENT  BOARD  ON  THE  REPORT  OF  THE  AUDITOR  GENERAL  CONCERNING  ACCOUNTS  OF  THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE
PROVIDENT  FUND  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDING  31.12.2004
2.1 Rendition of Accounts.–
Agree with observation
2.3 Comments on Accounts :
2.3.1 Accounting Deficiencies
(a) As in previous years tax adjusments for interest was done in the year which the interest amounts was actually received.
Since this fund was established by the Consolidated Fund and this Fund which contained of persons who receive
salaries from the Consolidated Fund, it may be exemption from taxation and step was also taken aware Commissioner
of Inland Revenue regarding this matter in written. With hope of such tax exemption, tax amounts will not be  provided
for interest receivable amount.
(b) Interest warrant for these investments in year 2003 was received only in year 2004. However, Rs.5,093,400 which
receivable interest for year 2003 was adjusted to profits at the time of preparation of Income and Expenditure Account
for year 2003. Amount relevant for year 2004 was also adjusted to Income and Expenditure Account for year 2004.
Tax amounts for interests were adjusted as mentioned in 2.3.1 (a) above,. Therefore, disagree with the observations.

(c) Although a separate record was not maintained for erroneous debits and credits, an Adjustment Account comprising
of all details on balances for each year up to 2002 was maintained in General Ledger as a memorandum Account.
Acccordingly, a separate Register was not maintained. A copy of the Adjustment Account in detail for year 2003
and 2004 and age analysis which prepared concering erroneous debits and credit balances to 31.12.2004. (Annex I,
II, III, IV)
In order to clear these balances, step was taken to aware concerned Deparments and Ministers in written and telephone
conversations. However, concerned authorities were not paid any attention for those reminders.
2.3.2 Obtaining debit and Credit Notices :
Agree with the observations
Debit notices were not obtained as all P. S. P. F. payments from year 2004 was made by cheques. In order to get
received notices of all credits to the Fund, the concerned Departments and Ministries were informed by circulars,
letters and telephone conversations. Up to date they maintain a procedure of sending a list alone with cheques or
a monthly report regarding credit of the relevant amount. Settlement of balances will be executed based on such reports.
2.3.3 Refund of Contributions :
All payments are being made based on Abetment Records. Contributions shall refund having obtained a Recovery
Report that attested by the concerned institution which has not lodged Abatement Report but contributions were
recovered for the particular year. That was caused due to receipt of Abatement Records by annually.
However, Board of Control of the Fund having met on 24.08.2005 decided to grant approval to exercise the authority
to make payment based on Recovery Reports in intances where if there may be difficulty to obtain Abatement
Records.
2.3.4 Lack of Evidence for Auditing :
Separate record is maintained  in respect of the institutions such as offices in Provincial Councils and other projects
which send amounts to the fund by cheques. Separate statements are being recorded concerning each institute of
respective Provincial Council. Relevant particulars are recorded only if contributions are received by the Fund from
an institution.
About 192 separate files are maintained by subject clerks for contribution receipts. As these files needed for daily
official requirements, part thereof would have released for the auditing. Other files may have provided if needed.
Institutions which funded by foreign invested projects and that pay salaries from other funds except the Consolidated
Fund do provide 12% contribution as their share. Such receives during the year 2004 is only 0.5% of the total
receivables.
2.3.5 Interest  paid in making Payment of Contribution :
This is payable from the Fund having taken into account of Abetment Records with based on the files and records
which maintained for receivables to the Fund from institutions of Provincial Councils. Further, a report regarding
the contributions which sent to the Fund is provided at instances when the particular institution applied for award
of payments. Therefore, interests will not be paid from the Fund for contributory amounts which not received to
the Fund. Accordingly, in terms of Public Service Provident Fund Act, interests will be paid in respect of the balance
amounts which kept in accounts of members.
3. Financial and Operating Review :
3.1 Financial Results
3.2 Informing the Balances of Members Accounts to the Contributor :
For the time being the balances of the members’ accounts up to year 1999 is forwarded. As new computer program is
preparing presently action will be taken to inform balances of the accounts of members after having inserted data of
members. Agree with the observations.
