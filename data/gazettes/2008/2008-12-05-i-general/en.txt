3.  Financial and Operating Review :
3.1 Financial Results :
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the University for the year under review had resulted in a defi cit
of Rs. 569,834,728 before taking into account the Government grant for recurrent expenditure as compared with the corresponding
deficit of Rs. 457,391,785 for the preceding year. After taking into Account the Government grant of Rs. 503,400,000 received for
recurrent expenditure, the deficit for the year under review had been reduced to Rs. 66,434,728 and the Government grant of
Rs. 391,000,000  received for recurrent expenditure for the preceding year had reduced the deficit to Rs. 66,391,785 for that y ear.
3.2 Utilization of Specific Funds :
The Grants received for specific purposes and interest thereon aggregating Rs. 36,241,239 had not been utilized for the purpose s
for which they were granted for.
3.3 Uneconomic Transactions  :
Following observations are made –
(a) There are eighteen number self financing courses are being conducted by the University. But not a single self financing course
had been completed within the stipulated period. Certain courses which were commenced in the year 2005 for one year duration
had not been completed even up to 30th April 2007. As per financial statements furnished a sum of Rs. 17,505,279 had been
collected for these self financing courses at the rate of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 34,000 from each student and a sum of Rs. 5,852,301
had been paid as lecture fees to the lecturers attached to the University. Further there were no information made available to
audit regarding the number of students enrolled to each self financing course, number of students passed out, the benefits accrued
to the University and to the students who followed these courses. It appears that these self financing courses are being conducted
to enhance the income of the lecturers in addition to the salaries paid to them for their permanent post as there were to benefits
accrued either to the students or to the University;
(b) Sixty-one numbers of direct telephone lines had been provided for various faculties and service units in the University and most
of the direct telephone lines had been utilised for the internal communication within the University instead of utilising the
intercom system. As a result a sum of Rs. 2,063,681 had been paid as telephone charges to the Telecom. This telephone charges
could be reduced to Rs. 452,471 if the intercom system is used in its full  capacity;
(c) It was observed in audit that an over payment of Rs. 10,680 had been made on purchase of a steel cupboard and a KDK Pedestal
Fan.
3.4 Fruitless Expenditure :
(a) A Suntel telephone facility had been purchased for Rs. 24,000 to the Media Resource Training Centre. At the same time a new
cable connection was also provided to the above unit at a cost of Rs. 23,000. As a result the Suntel telephone connection fees
of Rs. 24,000 treated as fruitless expenditure in audit.
(b) The University Council had approved to grant 14 month sabbatical leave with no pay and paid air passage to a Professor and
his spouse. He had submitted a placement letter from the University of Adelaide, Australia to work as Visiting Fellow in the
Department of Psychiatry. The requirement had not been completed and he has resigned from the post of Senior Professor,
Psychiatry with effect from 03rd April 2007 within the approved Sabbatical leave period. Therefore, the Universtiy had lost
his services. But he is not entitled sabbatical leave and air passage facilities in terms fo Section 22 of Chapter X of the
Establishments Code of the University Grants Commission and Higher Educational Institutions. Hence the air passage
amounting to Rs. 148,522 had been treated as fruitless expenditure in audit.
3.5 Slow Moving, Idle and Under Utilized Assets  :
The Following items of assets had been observed as slow moving, idle and under utilized assets in the University:
(a) Two scooters had not been used for more than five years;
(b) 4,229 number of published books had been idling in the consumable stores for a long period of time;

It was observed that a large amount of money was kept idling in a current account of the External Examination during the year under
review as well as in the preceding year without utilizing it for an effective investment. Balances ranging from Rs. 16,342,523 to

of construction would be tremendously increased and the objective of this project also had not been achieved. In addition a sum

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 05.12.2008
(a) Appointments to the permanent posts of lecturers had been made separately to each and every faculty of the University as
a general rule resulting engaging several lecturers in the same field of study. In preparing time tables of various Faculties, the
availability of the service of permanent lecturers in other Faculties had not been considered. Whenever the service of lecturers
in the permanent staff were required for another Faculty, separate letters of appointment had been issued to them as visiting
lecturers and additional lecture fees had been paid for such services.
(b) In several instances, temporary lecturers, tutors, demonstrators etc. had been appointed on the request made by the Heads of
Department without following proper recruitment procedure.
(c) The regular feature of the University that the filling of vacant posts of academic staff is in an improper manner without giving
an opportunity to compete those who have qualifications and expect employment in the University system.
Although this had been pointed out in my reports for the preceding years no action had been taken to rectify this deficiencies.
3.10 Academic Activities :
A sum of Rs. 89,702,328 had been paid as salaries and allowances for 414 academic staff for having conducted lecturers at various
faculties for 5,601 students. However, the following information had not been made available for audit to enable to evaluate th e
economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the activities undertaken by the academic staff such as number of students in each faculty,
lectures performed by each lecturer in each faculty, number of hours lectured/performed, number of examinations held, number of
students passed out etc.
3.11 Courses and Examinations Conducted  :
Following observations are made –
(a) Total number of students registered for 10 courses of the University was 5,601. Total recurrent expenditure incurred during
the year under review amounted to Rs. 323,812,766. The average recurrent cost per student for the year was Rs. 57,813.
(b) Dates to hold the examinations for various courses conducted under each faculty of the University and target dates to release
results of the examinations had not been determined. It was further observed that there were considerable delays in releasing
the results of the examinations conducted by certain faculties during the years 2005 and 2006. According to the University Grants
Commission Circular No. 636 of 14th July 1995 the results should be released within three months after the examination. But,
results had been delayed for the period ranging from 6 to 12 months.
3.12 Granting Leave with Pay and No Pay for Postgraduate Studies  :
Following observations are made –
(a) Study leave had been approved for more than one year to the lecturers who had gone abroad for higher studies without taking
into consideration for the instruction in Section 27.4 of Chapter X of the Establishments Code of the University Grants
Commission and the Higher Educational Institutions.
(b) There were instances that study leave had been approved to the lecturers who were under probationary periods.
3.13 Budgetary Control :
Major variations were observed between the budget and the actuals thus indicating that the budget had not been made use of as an
effective instrument of management control.
4.  Systems and Controls :
Deficiencies observed during the course of audit were brought to the notice of the Vice Chancellor of the University in my detailed
report issued in terms of Section 13(7) (a) of the Finance Act. Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control.
(a) Personnel Management
(b) Budget
(c) Purchases
(d) Stores

P. A. PEMATILAKA,
Auditor General.
Observation of the Governing Authority of the University of Jaffna on Report of the Auditor General on the accounts of
the University of Jaffna for the year ended 31st December, 2006.
2.2.2 ( a) Most of the receivable amounts represent the balance of loans/advances paid to the Employees and the payable account
represent the students deposit and staff security deposit. Therefore no confirmation is needed.
(b) Due to non submission of details of the sum of Rs. 192,370,372 by the Audit we are unable to make any comments. However
age analysis is given for all the loans/advances inclusive of supplies advance.
2.2.3 Due to non submission of details of the sum of Rs. 1,350,268,606 by the Audit we are unable to make any comments on this
observation.
2.2.4 University complies with the provisions in the Universities Act, E. Code and Circulars etc as far as possible.
3:3 ( a) In the year 2006 the Faculty of Graduate studies had conducted only eleven different self financing courses for nineteen batches
of Students (some of them are two years duration and some are conducted in two different centers). The main reason for the
delay to complete the course of studies within the stipulated time is getting the scripts marked by second examiners, most of
whom are from outside the University. In addition to this there has been considerable delay due to the situation that prevailed
in and around the University. Now we are taking every effort to complete these courses within the stipulated time.
The courses conducted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies are very popular and useful to the students in their career development
and to render their services to the society in a most effective manner. Further these courses provide an opportunity for the
University to achieve one of its prime objectives, which is the mission of the University.
The Faculty of Graduate Studies is conducting classes only during the week ends and after working hours. This arrangement
does not in any way disturb the normal functioning of the University.
(b) The expenditure is not for internal communication alone. It is the expenditure for both internal and external communication.
The annual rental for 61 telephone is as follows.–
61 x 12 x 1250 915,000.00
15% Vat on Rental 137,250.00 1,052,250.00––––––––––
The annual ceiling on usage allocation for 61 lines is as follows–
51 x 12 x 1,500 (Haeds of Depts.) 918,000.00
9 x 12 x 3,500 (Deans, Librarian, Registrar, Bursar) 378,000.00
1 x 12 x 5,000 (V. C.)  60,000.00
15% Vat on Telephone usage allocation 203,400.00 1,559,400.00 –––––––––––
2,611,650.00––––––––––––––––––––––
The annual ceiling on annual expenditure for Telephone calls is Rs. 2,611,650. However the actual expenditure on Telephone
communication in the year 2006 was only Rs. 2,063,681. Therefore the expenditure is within the allowed amount.
In all the Sri Lankan Universities, direct line telephones are provided to all the Academic Departments/Centers/Units and the
Administrative Branches, although they have their Intercom system. We cannot deny direct line telephone facilities to the
departments. However in the University of Jaffna, some of the academic branches have not yet been given direct line telephones.

1524 I fldgi : (I) fPoh ----- YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ----- 2008'12'05
PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 05.12.2008
Jaffna was without telephone facilities for over a decade (1985 - 1999). After 1999, the SLT has given us only a limited number of
connections. We had Inter-com facilities before 1995. This old system failed frequently. We approached the SLT for repairs but
they said it cannot be repaired and that we should go for a new PABX. While we were planning to commission a new PABX system,
in year 2002, a SIDA funded IT Network Project was approved and this project included intercom facilities. Therefore, the plan
to commission a new PABX system was shelved. The SIDA funded networking project was progressing well but, unfortunately
after April, 2006, the skilled employees from Colombo were reluctant to come Jaffna and as a result the contractors M/s. Enterprise
Technology (Pvt.) Ltd., from Colombo are unable to continue and finish the work.
If the contractors decide to abandon the networking programme, we shall decide on commissioning a PABX system. We are persuading
the contractors to recommence the work. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that
(a) No action had been taken to repair the system.
(b) The expenditure on telephone communication is unacceptably high due to internal communication.
(c) There is no overpayment as stated by the Audit. Purchase of K. D. K. Pedestal Fan and steel cupboard was made at two different
prices. First purchase of K. D. K. pedestal fan was made at the price of Rs. 4,900 in September, 2006. The second purchase
was made at the price of Rs. 7,000 in October 2006.Since the earlier supplier did not have the stock, the purchase was made
from another supplier at price of Rs. 7,000. The first pruchase of steel cupboard was made at the price of Rs. 11,250 in July
2006. and the second purchase was made  at the price of Rs. 10,490 in October 2006. The price fluctuation in Jaffna is a common.
3.4 ( a) New Connection was obtained from Sri Lanka Telecom hence the payment was made to the Suntel cannot be deducted from
the installation charges of Sri Lanka Telecom. Further the Suntel does not refund the money when the telephone facilities are
disconnected.
(b) In terms of section 22, Chapter X of the Establishment code of the University Grants Commission and Higher Educational
Institutions, an employee who submitted the notice of resignation from his/her post is not entitled to any annual leave or casual
leave during the period of the notice given. Although Prof. Somasundaram had given three months notice to resign his post
by his letter of 03.04.2007 it was not accepted and the effective date of his resignation is considered as from 03.04.2007. Thefore
he was informed by the V. C.’s letter of 21.05.2007 that an amount equivalent to three months salary would be recovered
from his provident fund, in terms of the agreement he entered with the University. Hence Prof. Somasundaram had not been
granted any leave with effect from the date of notice of registration to the date of termination of services.
As the sabbatical leave is an earned leave granted to certain category of employees after serving the University for a certain
period the benefit granted considering the services already rendered by him/her cannot be withdrawn without valid reasons.
Prof. Somasundaram was on sabbatical leave and had completed eleven months (from 02.05.2006 to 02.04.2007) when he
submitted his resignation. However Prof. Somasundaram is not entitled for return air passage as he will not return to the duty.
Prof. Somasundaram has already returned his return air ticket to the Aitken Spence overseas Travel services, Colombo and
action has been taken to get back the money from above travel agent.
Please note that the dues from an employee are not mentioned in the letter of acceptance of the resignation. All the dues will
be deducted from Provident Fund with the consent of the employee.
3.5 ( a) The purchasign officer had retired two years before and no appointment is made. Once the purchasing officer is appointed
the scooter in Jaffna and in Colombo will be used.
(b) Since most of these books are research publications there is no big demand from the public.
(c) Multi Station Machine was purchased in July, 2006 and was in use for a short period. Due to the disturbed situation in Jaffna
from August 2006 the students could not make use this machine. However the Instructors are using this machine.
(d) The three wheeler had been used economically.
(e) Please note that there is no strict rule that the model requested by the user department should be supplied. The Super Fax
RE450 model is used by several departments in this University and therefore it is advisable to supply the same model to the
External Unit also to facilitate the maintenance and supply of consumable items.
(f) After receiving of Cabinet approval, construction work will be commenced.

(g) This account is maintained to facilitate the remittance from abroad to the Vice Chancellor’s Welfare Fund. Inorder to keep
the account activate, this balance is kept in the current account number 6197 at the Bank of Ceylon, York Street
Colombo-01.
(h) Action will be taken to use the above metioned items.
(i) The University is unable to introduce the time recording machine due to objection of the Employees.
(j) With the anticipation of expanding of space, the Bookshelves were purchased. But due to some unavoidable reasons expansions
was not done. Therefore we have placed them in a side since no space is available in the Library.
(k) Building is under utilization now.
3.6 The bank balance indicated in the report  is related to non Treasury funds and not external unit as you stated.The non Treasury fund
balances consist of project funds and self financing courses etc. Therefore this money can not be transferred to fixed deposit. Please
note that the University cannot open fixed deposit utilizing the project funds and funds generated through Self Financing cours es.
3.8 ( a) No work for which agreements were signed before 1989 remain incomplete. But Arts Faculty Complex and Ramanathan
Academy of Fine Arts started before 1989 remain incomplete. As these were very big projects works were entrusted to the
Department of Buildings in stages, and the completed stages (Buildings) are being used. Please note that from 1990 - 1996
there was total ban on transport of construction materials to the North and there were restrictions and free transport was not
possible until A - 09 highway was opened in April 2002.
(b) The Rs. 7,611,885 paid was for the balance work of stage I which did not include finishes, decoration, sheeting etc. After
completing the documentation for interior decoration work tenders were called thrice. But on each occasion the University
Tender Board could not recommend a successful bidder. Later the University Council awarded this part of the work to the
Department of Buildings who needed and advance in full to start work.
(c) There is neither a Maintenance stores nor a Store Keeper at the Maintenance Branch. The store items received from the Finance
Branch are recorded in a register and issued for work. Once issued for work the balance is considered as nil. Since the Maintenance
Branch was not closed during the year end and as there was continuous work there are chances of few items of job in progress
available in the workshop. Some of the works continue for several days. The amount of Rs. 2,494,153 as indicated by the
Auditor General is for the minor repairs of buildigs/Structure/Services and not for the day to day upkeep.
(d) This work was suspended by the Department of Buildings in 1990 due to war like situation in Jaffna. Subsequently two number
wells and pump house were completed in 1999. We have written and reminded the Department of Buildings to complete the
work on the water tank.
(e) These allocations were made for the approved cadre of the Engineering Faculty of the University of Jaffna. No allocation has
been made by the University Grants Commission for Buildings. Also the Government has not issued the required Gazette
notification to establish a Faculty of Engineering.
3.9 ( a) The permanent teaching staff are involved in faculty as well as interfaculty teaching without any additional remuneration other
than their salary. When the teaching load of a teacher in his/her departments/Faculty is far in excess of the approved academic
norms of a prticular academic position, payment is made by appointing them as visiting lecturers for the lectures they take
out side their academic norms in departments out side the faculty to which they belong to. Only a small number of such visiting
appointments are made under inevitable circumstances.
Cadres are determined by the University Grants Commission based on the needs of each faculty. Further although the title
of the “field of Study” may look alike, the scope of the course and the courses contents could be very different. For example
the way physics, chemistry and mathematics is taught in a science faculty is different from how it is taught in an engineering
faculty.
(b) The temporary posts in Assistant Lecturer, Tutor, Demonstrator and instructors are regularly advertised before the
commencement of every academic year and recruitment is made by following the proper recruitment procedure.
However when an appointed person resigns or leaves the service during an academic year and when there is no adequate time
to fill the vacancy by Advertisement, appointments are made on the request of the Head and the Dean in very few occasions,
so as to carry out the academic programme within the scheduled academic calendar. Such appointments (a few) are made only
for the balance period of the appointments of the person resigned.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 05.12.2008
(c) Other than getting the services of a few senior academics on work assignment (or contract) basis, no other appointments were
made without giving opportunity to those who have the qualification to compete. All vacant positions are advertised regularly
and all eligible applicants in terms of the scheme of recruitment are called for interviews and they are evaluated by legally
constituted selection boards. Appointments are made based on the recommendations of selection committees, thereby giving
opportunities to all the eligible applicants.
3:10 The requested information are available at the Faculties and shall be furnished in the future.
3:11 ( b) In some Faculties examinations are conducted at the end of the academic year. In some at the end of each semester. However
the results of the examinations conducted at the end of the first semester are released along with the result of the second semester.
This is their examinations regulations. This is because if the results are released for each semester, there is a possibility of students
skipping two out of five course units in the second semester. However the structure of the Degree Programme are changed now
and for the new batches of students results are released within three months.
3:12 (a) & (b) The sections of the Establishment Code of the University Grants Commission and the Higher Educational Institutions
referred to in these paragraphs were amended by the University Grants Commission Circular No. 429 of 02.03.1990 by which
the authority is delegated to the Councils of Universities to use their discretions for the timing of granting study leave to teachers.
