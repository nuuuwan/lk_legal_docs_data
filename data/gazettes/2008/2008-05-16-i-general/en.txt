Act, No. 16 of 1978 and Section 13(7) (a) of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971.
THE audit of the financial statements of the National Institute of Library and Information Science Affiliated to the University of Colombo
for the year ended 31 December 2006 was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution
of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with Section 108(1) and 111 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and
Sub-sections (3), (4) and (7) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. This report is issued in terms of Section 108(2) of the Universities
Act and Section 13(7) (a) of the Finance Act.
1.2 Scope of Audit
Audit opinion, comments and findings in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and
substantive tests of samples of transactions. The scope and extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide and
audit coverage as possible within the limitations of staff, other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out  in
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, methods and practices to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatements. The audit included examination of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in financial statements and assessment of accounting principles and significant estimates and judgments made in the preparation
of financial statements, evaluation of their overall presentation and determining whether accounting policies adopted were
appropriate, consistently  applied and adequately disclosed. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of
1971 give discretionary powers to the Auditor General to determine the scope and extent of the audit.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination and to the best of my information and according to the explanations given to me, I am of
opinion that the National Institute of Library and Information Science has maintained proper books of account for the year ended
31 December 2006 and except for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report,
the financial statements which are in agreement with the said books have been prepared and presented in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards and the stated accounting policies and the Notes, (No.01 to 09) to the financial statements and give a tru e
and fair view of the financial position of the National Institute of Library and Information Science as at 31 December 2006 and
the financial results of the operations and cash flows for the year then ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements

(a) A sum of Rs. 879,394 received for the year 2006 in connection with sundry courses had been brought to account under
the Development Fund, thus understating the income of the year by that amount.
(b) The increase of funds amounting to Rs. 879,394 that should have been shown under the Operating Activities in the
Cash Flow Statement had been shown under the Financing Activities.
2.2.2. Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
The following instances of non-compliance were observed :
Reference to Laws, Rules, Regulations, etc. Non-compliance
(a) Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978–Section 109
(b) Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978–Section 110
(c) National Institute of Library and Information Science
Ordinance No. 01 of 1991–Section 12(6)
(d) Financial Regulation 756(1)
(e) Letter No. UGC/F/GA/2002 dated 13 January,
2003 of the Chairman of the University
Grants Commission
2.2.3. Transactions not Supported by Adequate Authority
The following observations are made :
(a) Even though the Circular No. BD/PF/1/174/1 dated 25 October, 2002 of the Director General of Public Enerprises
had instructed that the allowance for proficiency in the second and third languages should not be made applicable to
Public Corporations and Boards, contrary to such instructions a sum of Rs. 16,860 had been paid as salaries and
allowances for proficiencies in second and third languages.
(b) An overpayment of contributions amounting to Rs. 82,356 had been made to the Universities Provident Fund and
the Employees’ Trust Fund due to the erroneous inclusion academic allowances to the salary. Even though the Director
General of National Budget had, by his letter No. BD/INS/CLUS-A/078 of 18 July 2003, stated that the payment
was irregular and that the payments made should be recovered, no action had been taken in compliance.
3. Financial and Operating Review
3:1. Financial Results :
According to the financial statements presented, the working of the Institute for the year ended 31 December, 2006 had resulted
in a deficit of Rs. 9,911,824 before taking into account the Government Grant for recurrent expenditure as compared with the
corresponding deficit of Rs. 6,612,420 for the preceding year. The Government Grant of Rs. 5,927,000 received for the recurrent
expenditure of the year under review had reduced that deficit to Rs. 3,984,824 while the Government Grant of Rs. 3,883,000 received
for the recurrent expenditure of the preceding year had reduced the deficit for the year to Rs. 2,729,420.
The financial statements of each Institution of Higher Education
should be published in the Gazette after they are audited.
Nevertheless, it had not been done so in respect of the preceding
years
Even though the Annual Reports of the institution should be tabled
in Parliament, it had not been done so in respect of the preceding
years
The Academic Committee should conduct not less than ten (10)
meetings in each year. Nevertheless, only 07 Committee meetings
had been conducted in the year 2006.
Even though a Board of Survey should be appointed before 15
December of each year, it had not been done so.
Contrary to such instructions, a Development Fund had been
established and course fees amounting to Rs. 879,394 had been
credited to that Fund.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 16.05.2008
3:2. Performance
The National Institute of Library and Information Sciences had been established on World Bank aid under the Second General
Education Project.
According to the Project Plans, the primary objective of the institute is making provision for improvement of libraries and the
Education, Training and Research in the Branches of Library and Information Science.
The activities expected to be carried out for the achievement of the objectives are given below.
(i) Establishment of the Institute ;
(ii) Recruitment of Academic and Non-academic Staff ;
(iii) Training of the Academic and Non-academic Staff locally and abroad ;
(iv) Improvement of the Libraries and the Computer Unit of the Institute ;
(v) Commencement of Courses ;
(vi) Training of between 300-400 Teacher Librarians annually.
The following matters were observed during the course of audit :
(a) Even though the training of 300-400 Teacher Librarians annually is the main objective of establishment of the Institute,
the number of students registered under each course since the establishment of the Institute in the year 1999 up to
31 December of year under review stood at 610. The number of students who participated at one-day and two-day
workshops stood at 3,572 and the number of students who obtained certificates on completion of the courses stood
at 97. Therefore, the number of students who obtained certificates on completion of courses as a percentage of the
number of registered students amounted to 16 per cent. The number of Teacher Librarians trained during the year
under review stood at 90 but no certificates had been awarded.
(b) The number of students registered for courses during the year 2006/2007 as compared with the year 2005/2006
disclosed a decrease of 44 or 37.93 per cent.
(c) A sum of Rs. 163,454 had been spent on the publication of newspaper notices on various occasions for the conduct
of  9 courses during the year 2006. Nevertheless two courses had not been conducted as a number of students sufficient
for the courses had not been registered, while the number registered for the other courses stood at 134. Therefore,
it is observed that sufficient number of students do not register for the courses. The Directress informed that the
teachers do not show much interest in registration for the courses, due to the problematic state prevailing in the
Ministry of Education with regard to Teacher Librarians, that is, the unsettled conditions relating to the designation
of Teacher Librarians, criteria for their promotions, etc.
3:3 Idle Money
It was observed in audit that idle cash balances accumulate in Fund Accounts due to the crediting of income received annually to
such Fund Accounts. However, a sum of Rs. 3,458,373 remained in seven day call deposit investments and a current account as
at 31 December, 2006.
3:4 Budgetary Control
Significant variances were observed between the budgeted and the actual income and expenditure, thus indicating that the budget
had not been made use of as an effective instrument of management control.
4. Systems and Controls
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of conrol :
(a) Inventory Stocks Control ;
(b) Collection and Accounting for Income ;
(c) Maintenance of Books and Registers relating to Courses and Workshops’

2. Accounts
2.2 Comments on Accounts
2:2:1. Accounting Deficiencies
(a) After completion of academic programs started in 2006 and before, course income of Rs. 879,394 has been transferred
to the development fund of the Institute as a result of Board of Management decision.
(b) As a result of the above decision, this income was treated as a change in internal fund instead of operational income

Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.

Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.
(c) In accordance with the Section 12(6) of the National Library & Information Sciences Ordinance No. 01 of 1991 ten
meetings of the Academic Committee were scheduled per year but scheduled three meetings scheduled could not be
held due to lack of the quorums.
(d) Board of Survey was appointed after due date. But the report has been submitted to the Audit.
(e) Balances of the completed Budgets have been transferred to the Development Fund according to the decision of the
Board of Management.

3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Results
Agreed with the observation made in the Report.
3.2 Performance
Conducting Courses
(a)&  ( b) The Institute was established in 1999 under the ordinance but fulltime Director was appointed in January 2002. The
curricula developments and approval of the Senate of the University have taken place thereafter. Post-graduate and Non
Post-graduate courses were started in June 2003. 4182 students have been trained by the Institute by the end of 2005. (pl.

PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 16.05.2008
(b) Paper advertisements were made to promote courses of the institute and image of the Institute. In the year of 2006, 399
students have been trained according to the annexed No. 03. Adequate numbers of students for the Teacher Librarian programs
were not registered due to the problem in the designation of the Teacher Librarian. The promotion and designation of the
Teacher Librarians have not yet been finalised by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, Teachers are reluctant to register
for these programs. Ministry of Education has taken steps to solve these problems.
3.3 Idle Money
Cash balance arises as incomes of the programs have been received from students at the beginning of the programs and expenditure
is spread out throughout the year.
3.4 Budgetary Control
Action will be taken to use the Budget of the Institute as an effective management tool for control purposes.
4. Systems and Control
Action will be taken to improve the controls over stocks, income of programs and maintain of books of workshops.
