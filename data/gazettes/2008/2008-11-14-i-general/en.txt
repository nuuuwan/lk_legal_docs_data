PART  I :  S EC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 14.11.2008
The Director General of Pensions,
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the Public Service Provident Fund for the Year ended 31
December, 2006
THE audit of financial statements of the Public Service Provident Fund for the year ended 31 December, 2006 was carried out under my
direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (3) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka r ead in
conjunction with Section 24 (1) of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance (Cap. 621).
1.2 Scope of Audit
Audit opinion, comments and findings in this report are based on a review of the financial statements presented to audit and
substantive tests of samples of transactions. The scope and the extent of such view and tests were such as to enable as wide an audit
coverage as possible within the limitations of staff, other resources and time available to me. The audit was carried out in accordance
with Sri Lanka Audting Standards, methods and practices to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatements, evaluation of their overall presentation and determining whether accounting policies adopted were
appropriate, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination, and to the best of my information, and according to the explanations given to me, I am
of opinion, that the Public Service Provident Fund had maintained proper books of account for the year ended 31st December,
2006 and except  for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial
statements which are in agreement with the said books have been prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principle and the stated accounting policies as set out in Notes (No. 01 to 08) to the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the financial position of the Public Service Provident Fund as at 31st December, 2006 and the financial results
of its operation and cash flows for the year then ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Accounting Deficiencies
The total of erroneous debits and erroneous credits as at the end of the year under review amounted to Rs. 3,985,942 and
Rs. 85,479 respectively and the net debit balance amounting to Rs. 3,900,463 resulting from the setting off those against
each other had been shown under the current assets in the balance sheet. Those erroneous debit and credit balances included
debit balances of Rs. 2,703,686 and credit balances of Rs. 85,133 which had remained over periods exceeding 5 years. Out
of those erroneous debit balances, Rs. 1,591,724 related to the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and
Rs. 1,114,259 related to the Police Department. Out of the erroneous credit balances, Rs. 25,000 related to the Department
of Local Government while Rs. 22,444 related to the Department of Attorney General.
2.2.2 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
Even though the Treasury Circular No. IAI/2002-02 of 28 November, 2002 requires the maintenance of a separate Register
of Fixed Assets for computers, accessories and software for recording all transactions from the purchase of computers up
to the disposal, such register in respect of the computers, accessories and software of the Fund had not been maintained.
2.2.3 Irregular Refund of Contributions
Refunds of contributions had been made on the basis of certified adhoc statements of recoveries furnished from time to
time in instances where detailed Registers of Abatements had not been furnished to the Fund. Such payments made in 08
instances detected at a test check ralating to the year under review amounted to Rs. 119,451 and it was not possible to be
satisfied in audit with regard to their correctness.
3. Financial and Operating Review

3.2 Percentage of Interest provided to Contributors
An analysis of interest percentage provided by the Fund to the contributors during the year under review and the 10 preceeding
years is given below. :
Year 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
Interest
Percentage
(%) 14 13.25 12.5 12 11.75 11.25 10.75 10.5 10.25 9 8.04
According to the above analysis, a gradual decrease in the interest percentage provided by the Fund to the contributors is
indicated and a comparison of the years 1996 and 2006 revealed that the interest percentage for the year 2006 as compared with
the year 1996 had decreased by 42.57 per cent. The Director General of Pensions reported to me that it was due to the decrease
of new investment opportunities resulting from the crediting of 8 per cent compulsory contributions of Government Departments
through the Monthly Summaries of Accounts instead of by cash and the non-receipt the Government contribution of 12 per cent
from the Treasury.
3.3 Trends in the Enhancement of the Number of Contributors and Investments
A trend analysis of the enhancement of the number of contributors and the investments during the 05 years ended 31 December,
2006 based on the values as at 31 December, of each of those years is given below. :
2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
% %%% %
Enhancement in the Number of Contributors 0 0 4.22 14.42 5.08
Enhancement in the Investments of the Fund 14.03 32.79 19.54 10.64 9.25
Even though there was no enhancement in the number of contributors in the years 2002 and 2003, there was an increase in the
enhancement of investments. Even though the number of contributors had enhanced from the year 2004, the enhancement of the
investments of the Fund had decreased gradually. The Director General of Pensions reported to me that the position was due to
the decrease in additional investments resulting from the crediting of contributions of Government Departments with a large
number of members through the Monthly Summaries of Accounts and the non-receipt of the government contributions.
3.4 Performance :
The following observations are made :
(a) The expected targets according to the Action Plan for the year 2006 and the actual position are given below :
Activity Expected As at 31 December, 2006
Target
Financial Physical
Progress Progress
(i) Registration of Members 10,000 - 100%
(ii) Collection of Contributions (Rs. Millions) 852 75% 75%
(iii) Investment of Surplus Money (Rs. Millions) 2,000 51% -
(iv) Payment of Benefits to Contributors (Rs. Millions) 100 50% 50%
(b) According to paragraph 04 of Circular No. 1/97 dated 31 July, 1997 of the Director General of Pensions, an advice on the
money credited to the Fund in each months should be furnished by the respective institutions to the Secretary to the Fund
before 15th of the month following. Nevertheless, only 04 institutions had furnished such advices in the year 2006. The
progress of the action taken by the institution to obtain such advices had not reached the expected level.

3.5 Notification of Balances in Members’ Accounts to Contributors
In terms of Section 25 of the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinacne, the Director of Pensions should, at the end of each year,
notify the balances in the members’ accounts as at 31 December, to the contributors. Even though the total membership of the
Fund stood at 208,012 as at 31 December, 2006 I was informed that the balances as at 31 October, 2006 relating to 35,000
Reserve Police Officers only had been prepared. Action had not been taken over a number of years to notify the year end
balances to the members due to the non-receipt of Registers of Abetment and the non-maintenance of up to date individual
accounts for each contributor. The Members’ Registers had not been updated to facilitate the identification of the active and
dormant members separately.
3.6 The Excess of the Government Contribution
In terms of provisions in the Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance, a sum equal to 1.5 times the compulsory contribution
should be credited to the Fund by the Government as the Government contribution. Even though a sum of Rs. 8,958,069,154
equivalent to 1.5 times the balance of Rs. 5,972,046,103 in the compulsory contributions as at 31 December, 2006 should be
with the Government Contribution Account, the actual balance therein amounted to Rs. 8,965,113,834 indicating an excess of
Rs. 7,044,680 in the Government contribution. The Public Service Provident Fund Ordinance does not contain provisions for
action to be taken on the occurrence and maintenance of such excess. The Director General of Pensions informed me that the
Management Council has the power to decide on matters not provided for in the Ordinance.
4. Systems and Controls
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control :
(a) Obtaining Registers of Abatement
(b) Collection of Contributions
(c) Proper Maintenance of Books including the Cash Book.
(d) Settlement of Erroneous Debit and Credit Balances.
(e) Action on Audit Observations
(f) Preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements.

Observations of the PSPF Management Board on the Report of the Auditor General concerning Accounts of the Public Service
Provident Fund for the Year ending 31.12.2006
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Accounting Deficiencies
Despite frequent written notices and telephonic conversations the relevant Departments and Ministries which yet not have
settled the erroneous credits and debits balances for exceeded past 5 years are not taken action to settle the same. Therefore no
action has been taken up to date to overcome this matter. Accordingly it has been unable to correct above complex situation.
2.2.2 Non-compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
As a separate Register of Fixed Assets has not being maintained for computers, accessories and software, steps will be taken
to setting a separate Register thereon.
2.2.3 Refund of Contributions
All payments are being made based on Abatement Register. As the Abatement Register for year 2007 is received on year 2008,
refunds of year 2007 will be made based on a certified revenue report if contributions have been recovered.
Considering the inconveniences of contributors, the Board of Management of the Fund having met on 24.08.2005 and decided
to grant approval to Secretary and Accountant of the fund to exercise the authority to make payment based on certified revenue
reports certified by the relevant institution which not submitted the Abatement Register for the years before 10 to 15.

3. Financial and Operating Review
3.2 Percentage of Interest provided to Contributors
The interest percentage appropriated in year 2006 has been lessened comparing the year 1996 as a result of enhancement in receipt
of contributions than the receipt of investment revenue from year 1996 to 2006. Reason for that is the investments of the fund
remained primarily on the re-investment and after realization of invested amounts which invested in higher interest rate in past years
had to re-invest in low percentage rate. Though the recovery of general contributions have been developed, the amount of 8%
debited by the departments in central government are debited by account summary flow of currency has not occurred. Further the
Treasury has abstained from providing the share of 12% for the last year. Under these circumstances no opportunity being received
to have new investment but only to re-invest. Therefore slight increase in interest rate and vast increase in contribution amounts has
been caused to divide the slight increase between large parties which pave the way to decrease the appropriated interest rate in year
2006 with compare to year 1996.
3.3 Trend in the Enhancement of the Number of Members and Investments
The reason to not climb of the investment though a development could be observed in number of members is not receipt of additonal
money to make investment. On the ground of not receipt of 12% amount from the Treasury for years 2005 and 2006 comparing to
year 2004 and not receipt of money to the fund truthfully from the Government Departments and Ministries which the large
number of Members of the fund are served as those institutions have been sent contributions through account summaries. Under
these circumstances the fund depends on re-investments. Accordingly it is kindly informed that there would be no increase in
investments parallel to the rise in number of members. To overcome this issue there should be method to credit total contributions
in cash. If that is possible there will be competence to improve investments.
3.4 Performance
(A) Observation for the actual position and Action Plan for the year 2006 has been set out below :
(a) Number of new members for registration was expected as 10,000 which increased up to 10,683 at the date of 31.12.2006.
(b) Predicted recovery amount was Rs. 852 million though actual recovery was Rs. 698. Reason for that was not receipt of
(12%) of Government bonus of that is Rs. 250. However 75% has been recovered.
(c) Though we have expected additional Rs. 2,000 million of investment, the total actual invest is Rs. 3,064. Most of the
amount of that was based on re-investments. As mentioned in above I and II not receipt of allocations from the contributions
in year 2006, there was a shortfall in additonal investments. Reasons for that was crediting amount of 8% by account
summaries and not receipt of 12% Government portion.
(d) 50% of total applications received for claim benefits were able to paid-up. Reason for that were most applications received
to make awards to appointees in contributory pensions scheme in year 2006 was paused without making payment till
instructions were delivered having abolished the act. Therefore we were unable to make prompt payments to all claimers’
applications to awards.
(B) By Circular 1/97 and further by Circular 14/2006 dated 30.10.2006 all Departments and Ministries were informed to send
debit notices which do not send by those institutions. Disregarding the instructions those institutions follow the method of
submitting along with cheques or a list with other means. The view which stated that productive measures have not been taken
is unacceptable. Accordingly it is informed that the productive steps which this fund implements could not being acheived due
to incorporative actions of relevant institutions.
3.5 Notification of the Balances in Member’ s Accounts to the Contributors
For the time being the balances of the Members’ Accounts up to year 1999 is forwarded. As new computer program is preparing
presently action will be taken to inform balances of the accounts of members after having inserted data of members. Agree with the
observations.
3.6 The Excess of the Government Contribution :
Public Service Provident Fund controlled by the Act and Management Board established by the act. Therefore all provisions of the
act were not included and various decisions are taken by the Management Board when necessary.
On some occasions the interest has been utilized for appropriations. The reason for this surcharge was unavailability of members
to claim to draw money from the fund and members’ attempts claim for money after a long time of the abolition of membership.

Therefore this surplus has been occurred as the benefits receive on a result of investments were credited to relevant accounts.
Further, when the Treasury does not allocate money for the Government bonus, 1.5 per-cent of the compulsory contributions are
transferred to the Government bonus account.
