(ii) In case of any doubt regarding your entry for a paper or
eligibility to sit a paper you should bring it to the notice of the Supervisor
and get your doubts cleared. Failure to do so may result in your
candidature for the subject being cancelled.
(iii) When appearing for the Examination, candidates should

pencils, coloured chalk, etc.
(vi) When you start answering you should promptly write down
your index number and the name of the Examination on each sheet of
paper used. Write neatly and legibly on both sides of the paper. Leave
a blank  line after the answer to each part of a question. After the
answer to a full question leave one or several blank lines. Do not crowd
in your work.
 (vii)  The left-hand margin of the answer sheet is set apart for you
to enter the number of the question you answer. The right hand margin
is reserved for the examiner’s use and nothing should be written there.
Number your answers correctly as incorrect numbering leads to
confusion.
 (viii)  You should read carefully the instructions given at the  head
of the question paper, with regard to the compulsory questions and the
manner in which the other questions should be selected. Disregard to
these instructions is often liable to affect you adversely.
 (ix) When Mathematics questions are answered, give all details
of calculations and any roughwork, in their serial order as part of the
working of the problem. Necessary sketches, diagrams and figures should
be accurate and sufficiently large. In an  answer running into serveral
pages if reference must be made to a diagram drawn in an earlier page,
that diagram should be drawn repeatedly.
 (x) At the end of each paper, arrange your answer sheets  in the
order you answered the questions. Then using the piece of twine supplied,
tie them up at  the top left hand corner. Do not  tie up at the top right
hand corner.
 (xi) You should personally handover your answer script  to the
Supervisor or to an Invigilator. Or else remain in your seat till it is
collected.  Failure to do so may result in the loss of your script and your
being treated as an absentee for the paper. On no account should your
script be handed over to a peon or an attendant.
 (xii)  If it becomes necessary for you to speak to the Supervisor or
an Invigilator, or if you need stationery, remain in your seat and raise
your hand.

Part B
Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions
set out below :-
Most modern political ideals such, for example, as justice, liberty,
constitutional government, and respect for the law or at least the
definitions of them, began with the reflection of Greek thinkers
upon the institutions of City State, But in the long history of
political thought the meaning of such terms has been variously
modified and always that meaning has to be understood in the light
of the institutions by which the indicates were to be  realized and of
the society in which those institutions did their work. The Greek
City States was so different from the political communities in
which modern men live that it requires no small effort of the
imagination to picture its social and political life. The Greek
Philosophers were thinking of political practices far different from
any that have prevailed commonly in modern world, and the whole
climate of opinion in which the work was done was different. Their
problems though not without their analogies in the preset, were
never identical with modern problems and the ethical apparatus by
which political life was evaluated and criticized varied widely from
any that now prevails. In order to understand at all accurately what
their theories meant is necessary first to realize at least roughly
what kind of Institutions they had in view and what citizenship
connected as an effect and as an ideal, to the public for whom they
wrote. For this purpose the Government of Athens-is especially
important, partly because, it is the best known, but chiefly because
it was an object of special concern to the greatest of Greek
Philosophers.
As compared with modern states the ancient City-State was
exceedingly small both in area and in population. The numbers
were exceedingly uncertain but, a figure somewhat in excess of
three hundred thousand would be approximately correct. Such an
agrrangement of a small territory dominated by a single City was
typical off the City State.

Syllabus Guidelines
The following notes are designed to give teachers and idea of the
scope of the Ordinary Level French question papers. the notes are
not intended to be comprehensive but they provide guidance on the
linguistic content of the examination.
Knowledge of an ability to use, the structures listed below may
be tested in any language areas within the normal range of the
imaginative or real experience of the average school pupil of 15 or
16. It would clearly be impossible to produce a comprehensive list
of such areas but they would include the family, school, life in town
and country, transport and travel, shopping, eating and drinking,
holidays, sport, usual professions and occupations.
The language of Ordinary Level, as compared with Advanced
Level, is more straight forward and does not involve very complex
description or complicated intellectual processes. The registers are
narrative with simple description, or conversation ; a very colloquial
flavour, as well as a very literary of technical flavour, is avoided. It
should, however, be noted that where no production of French is
required (e.g. in Paper 2) the language may will be more complex
and may contain some lexical items not necessarily actively known
by pupils for whom the examination is intended :
(1) Formation and use of all regular and common irregular verbs,
including reflexives, in all simple and compound tenses of
the indicative (excluding the subjective for active use) ;
interrogative, negative and imperative forms ; passive and
avoidance of the passive ; participles, infinitive, common
impersonal verbs ; agreement of participles ; government
of verbs ; inversion,

(4) Nouns.- Gender and number, single and compound, common

feminine and plural forms (of regular and common irregular
adjectives), comparative and superlative, agreement and

Syllabus Guidelines
The following notes are designed to give teachers an idea of the
scope of the Ordinary Level Spanish question papers. The notes
intended to be comprehensive but they provide guidance on the
lingustic content of the examination.
Knowledge of an ability to use, the structures listed below may
be tested in any language area within the normal range of the
imaginative or real experience of the average school pupil of 15 or
16. It would clearly be impossible to produce a comprehensive list
of such areas but they would include the family, school, life in town
and country, transport and travel, shopping, eating and drinking,
holidays, sport, usual professions and occupations.
The language of Ordinary Level, as compared with Advanced
Level, is more straight forward and does not involve very complex
description or complicated intellectual process. The registers are
narrative with simple description, or conversation ; a very colloquial
flavour, as well as a very literary of technical flavour, is avoided. It
should, however, be noted that where no production of Spanish is
required the language may well be more complex and may contain
some lexical items not necessarily actively known by pupils for
whom the examination is intended.
(1) Formation and use of all regular and common irregular verbs,
including radical and orthographical changing verbs and
reflexives, in all tenses of the indicative and subjective (the
subjective will be required for active use only in common
situation such as ; in its imperativeuse; after verbs of feeling ;
instraight forward conditional clauses, in future temporary
clauses ; after common conjunctions like para que, sin que,
como si, etc.) ; interrogative, negative and imperative forms ;
passive and avoidance of the passive ; participles, infinitive,
gerund ; common impersonal verbs. Use of ser and estar.
(2) Pronouns.–  Conjunctive, disjunctive, demonstrative
common indefinite, interrogative, possessive, relative;
position of pronouns ; use of se.

(5) Adjectives.– qualifying, numeral (cardinals and lower
odinals), demonstrative, indefinite, interrogative,
possessive, compound, masculing/ feminine and plural
forms (of regular and common irregular adjectives),
comparative and superlative ; agreement and position ;
adverbial use; apocopation.
(6) Adverbs.– Form and position, comparative and
superlative ; adverb phrases  ; negative expressions.
(7) Conjunctions in common use.
(8) Prepositions.– In common use, with special reference to
differences between Spanish and English usage ; por and
