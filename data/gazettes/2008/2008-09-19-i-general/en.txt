substantive tests of samples of transactions. The scope and the extent of such review and tests were such as to enable as wide an

2. Financial Statements
2.1 Opinion
So far as appears from my examination, and to the best of my information, and according to the explanations given to me, I am of
opinion, that the Public Service Provident Fund had maintained proper books of account for the year ended 31 December, 2005 and
except for the effects on the financial statements of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 of this report, the financial statements
which are in agreement with the said books have been prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles and the Stated Accounting Policies as set out in note (No. 01 to 08) to the financial statements give a true and fair view
of the financial position of the Public Service Provident Fund as at 31 December, 2005 and the financial results of its operation and
cash flows for the year then ended.
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Rendition of Financial Statements
Although the Annual Financial Statements should be rendered to audit before 30 April of the following year in terms
of Treasury Circular No. 836 of 16 August, 1977, the financial statements of the Fund for the year ended 31 December,
2005 were rendered to audit on 16 November, 2006 after a delay of more than six months.
2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
The erroneous debit balance at the end of the year under review was Rs. 8,920,947, while the erroneous credit balance
was Rs. 85,479. Accordingly a net debit balance of Rs. 8,835,468 had been shown under current assets in the balance
sheet after setting off the above two balances.
2.2.3 Payment of Contributions
Detailed abatement records had not been submitted to the Fund at many instances, and when making refunds,
contributions had been made based on the income records certified and sent by the respective institutions. Therefore,
it was not possible to be satisfied in audit on the correctness of such payments.
2.2.4 Non-Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
The Annual Budget for the year 2005 furnished on 01 December, 2005 to audit, had not been prepared in terms of
paragraph 4 of the Treasury Ciruclar No. 836 of 16 August, 1977.
2.2.5 Lack of Evidence for Audit
Separate records had not been maintained in respect of all the institutions that are liable to send contributions, and
records were maintained only in respect of the institutions that had sent contributions. As a result, it could not be
ascertained in audit regarding the value of compulsory contributions and the respective government contributions
receivable.
2.2.6 Transmission of Funds
It was observed that there had been frequent delays in sending of compulsory contributions from institutions under
Provincial Councils and Provincial Councils themselves. No action had been taken by the institutions to recover those
amounts in time.
3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Results
3.1.1 According to the financial statements presented, the financial results for the year under review, was a surplus of Rs.
987,918,895, while the financial results after appropriation was a surplus of Rs. 4,670,935. The corresponding
financial results for the preceeding year, was a surplus of Rs. 974,530,715, while the financial results after appropriation
was a surplus of Rs. 8,250,877, thus indicating a deficit of financial results after appropriation, by Rs. 3,579,942 as
compared with the preceeding year.

dividing a favourable rate of interest to the members when fluctuation of interest rates taken place in the money

According to Section 25 of the Public-Service Provident Fund Act, the Director of Pensions should inform the contributors,
the balances of the member’s accounts prevailed as at 31 December, after the close of each financial year. Although the total
number of members of the Fund as at 31 December, 2005 was 197, 951, it was intimated to me that, the balances as at 31
December, 2005 had been prepared only in respect of 34,587 officers of the Reserve Police. Action had not been taken to
inform the year end balances to the members for over several years due to non-receipt of abatement registers and non-
maintenance of updated accounts separately for each contributor. However, register of members had not been maintained to
identify, the active members and in-active members separately.
4. Systems and Controls
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control.
(a) Obtaining abatement registers
(b) Obtaining contributions
(c) Maintenance of registers, books and records
(d) Settlement of erroneous debit and credit balances.
P. A. Pematilaka,
Auditor General.
Observations of the PSPF Management Board on the Report of the Auditor General concerning Accounts of the Public Service
Provident Fund for the year ended 31.12.2005
2.2 Comments on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Rendition of Financial Statements
Agree with observation
2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies
The total of the erroneous credit is to the date of 31.12.2005 is Rs. 8,920,946.57 and amount of Rs. 5,586,625.25 belongs to
the Ministry Foreign Affairs and amount of Rs. 56,283.95 of District Secretariat-Hambanthota has been settled. Accordingly
the balance to be settled further to the date of 31.12.2005 is Rs. 3,278,037.37. Action will be taken step by step to settle
Rs. 2,703,434.05 as it considered as pre balances. Relevant Department and Ministries are informed to settle these balances
though they have not made any positive reply up to date and have been a huge difficulty to settle these balances.
2.2.3 Refund of Contributions
All payments are being made based on Abatement Records. Contributions shall refund having obtained a Credit Report that
attested by the concerned institution which has not lodged Abatement Report but if the contributions were recovered for the
year referred. Reason for that is the Abatement Records are received annually.
However, Board of Control of the Fund having met on 24.08.2005 decided to grant approval to Secretary and Accountant of
the fund to exercise the authority to make payment based on certified Credit Reports in instances where only if there may
be difficulty to obtain Abatement Records.

2.2.4 Non compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
The budget report has furnished to audit. The reason to not furnishing of a budget report as mentioned in Budget Circular 836
has been come about due the Department of Pensions utilizes annually estimated allocations for the expenditures of this fund
and taking action having prepared annual estimate combined with the estimates of the Department of Pensions.
2.2.5 Lack of Evidence for Auditing
Separate record is maintained in respect of the institutions such as offices in Provincial Councils and other projects which
send amounts to the fund by cheques. Separate statements are being recorded referring each institute of respective Provincial
Council. Particulars concerned are recorded only if contributions are received to the Fund from the relevant institution.
About 192 separate files are maintained by subject clerks for contribution receipts. As these files required for day to day
official duties, some part thereof would have released for the auditing. Other files may have provided if needed. Institutions
which funded by foreign invested projects and that pay salaries from other funds except the Consolidated Fund do provide
12% contribution as their share. Such receives during the year 2005 is merely 0.5% of the total receivables.
2.2.6 Transmissions of Funds
This is payable from the Fund having taken into account of Abatement Records with based on the files and records which
maintained for receivables to the Fund from institutions of Provincial Councils. Further, a report regarding the contributions
which sent to the Fund is provided at instances when the particular institution applied for award of payments. Therefore
interests will not be paid from the Fund for contributory amounts which not received to the Fund. Accordingly, in terms of
Public Service Provident Fund Act, interests will be paid in respect of the balance amounts which kept in accounts of
members.
3. Financial and Operating Review
3.1 Financial Results
3.1.2 Interests shall appropriate to members having utilized the interest received after investing the contributions received to fund.
Decision to invest has been taken by the Board of Control to appropriate the best interest rate to its members.
