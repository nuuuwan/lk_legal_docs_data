iNDEPENDENt AUDitOR’S REPORt
tO tHE BOARD Of MANAGEMENt Of S W R D BANDARANAiKE NAtiONAL MEMORiAL fOUNDAtiON
Report on the Audit of the financial Statements 
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of S W R D Bandaranaike National Memorial foundation (“the 
foundation”), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31st December 2021, and the statement of income 
and expenditure, statement of changes in funds, statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
in our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
foundation as at 31st December, 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SLfRS for SMEs).
basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the foundation in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of 
Ethics) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Other Information
the Board of Management is responsible for the other information. these financial statements do not comprise 
other information.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
Responsibilities of management and Those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
the Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with SLfRS for SMEs, and for such internal control as Board of Management determines is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, Board of Management is responsible for assessing the foundation’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless Board of Management either intends to liquidate the foundation or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the foundation’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at Sri Lanka 
Accounting and Auditing Standards website at: http://slaasc.com/auditing/auditorsresponsibility.php. this description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.

readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
  the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only the 
financial year or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
