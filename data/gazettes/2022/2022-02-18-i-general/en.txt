the Vice-Chancellor, 
Eastern university, Sri Lanka. 
Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the Eastern University, Sri Lanka for the year ended 
31 December 2020 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. 
1. financial Statements
 1.1 Qualified Opinion 
  the audit of the financial statements of the Eastern university, Sri Lanka (“university’) for the year ended 31st 
Decembet, 2020 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020 and the statement of financial 
performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under my direction in 
pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read 
in conjunction with Sub-section 107(5) and Section 108 of the universities Act, No.16 of 1978 and provisions of the 
National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. My comments and observations which i consider should be published with the 
Annual Report of the university in terms of Section 108 (1) of the university Act, appear in this report. My report to 
Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 ( 6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course. 
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my report, 
the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university as at 31 
December 2020, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 ( a) the cost of other assets of Rs. 104,464,552 had been shown under property plant equipment without grouping of 
assets of a similar nature or function in an entity’s operations according to Paragraph 50 of the Sri Lanka Public 
Sector Accounting Standards 07.
 ( b) the useful lifetime of fixed assets had not been reviewed annually in terms of paragraph 65 of the Sri Lanka 
Public Sector Accounting Standard 07. Property, Plant and Equipment costing Rs. 536,453, 179 had been fully 
depreciated but still being used by the end of the year under review. No action had been taken to rectify the 
estimated error in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 03.

 ( c) the land around 210 hectares at 11 locations of the university had not been valued and brought to the financial 
statements.
 ( d) the interest income from short term investment amounting to Rs. 18,894,941 had been shown under restricted 
fund shown under non current liability in the Statement of financial Position without recognizing as income. As a 
result, the surplus for the year under review had been understated by Rs. 3, 198,334, general reserve and restricted 
fund had been understated and overstated by Rs. 18,894,941 respectively at the end of the year under review in 
the financial statements.
 ( e) Even though buildings should be depreciated at 5 per cent as per the depreciation policy, the Pathology Laboratory 
costing of Rs. 3,666,316 had been depreciated at 10 per cent. As a result, the accumulated depreciation had been 
overstated by Rs.1,283, 156 in the financial statements.
 ( f) Direct debits in 3 bank accounts aggregating Rs. 4,060, 132 had been shown as unidentified debits in the bank 
reconciliation without being identified as expenditure in the financial statements.
i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements section of 
my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified 
opinion.
