 (d) Lack of Evidence for Audit
  formal Register of fixed Assets and Board of Survey Reports had not been furnished in respect of assets 
account balance of Rs. 1,984,409,725 stated in the financial statements.
  i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial 
Statements section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for my qualified  opinion.
 1.3 Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or  error.
  in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for  assessing the Uva Wellassa University’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
  those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Uva Wellassa University’s financial reporting 
process.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 16.09.2022
1131
  As per Sub-section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the University is required to maintain proper 
books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial 
statements to be prepared  of the institute.
 1.4 Auditor’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgment  and maintain 
professional  skepticism throughout the audit. i also:
 
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Uva 
Wellassa University’s internal control.
 
• Evaluate the appropriateness  of   accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 
• Conclude on the appropriateness  of  the  management’s  use  of  the going concern basis of accounting and based  
on  the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Uva Wellassa University’s ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, i am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the University to  cease  to continue as a going concern.
  i  communicate  with  those charged   with governance   regarding, among  other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that  i identify during my audit.
2.  Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
  National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 includes specific  provisions for  following requirements.
 
• Except for the effect of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, i have obtained all  
the  information  and explanation that required for the audit and as far as appears from my examination, proper 
accounting records have been kept by the Uva  Wellassa University as per the requirement of Section  12 (a) of the 
National  Audit Act,  No. 19 of 2018.
 
• the financial statements presented by the Uva Wellassa University are consistent with the preceding year as per the 
requirement of Section 6 (1) (d)  (iii)  of the National  Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.
 • the financial statements presented includes all the recommendations made by me in the previous year as per the 
requirement of Section 6 (1) (d) (iv) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.

cash outflows using interest rates that are denominated  in  the currency m which the benefits  will  be paid,  and  
that  have terms to maturity  approximating to the terms of  the related liability. the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are, determined on an actuarial basis using number of

Uva Wellassa University for the year ended 31st December, 2019 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit  
Act, No. 19 of 2018
1. financial Statements
 1.1 Opinion
  the audit of financial statements of the Uva Wellassa University for the year ended 31st December,  
2018   comprising  the statement of  financial Position as at 31st December, 2019 and the statement of financial 
performance, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies was carried out under my direction in 
pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read 
in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 and the finance Act, No.38 of 1971. My 
report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course.
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis  for Qualified Opinion section of my 
report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Uva Wellassa 
University as at 31st December, 2019 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
 (a) Although details of contingent liabilities, unidentified contractual commitments and non-financial disclosures 
are required to be disclosed in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards 01 and 08, 
disclosures in connection with the case filed on 04th September, 2019 by a retired officer against the University 
for claiming gratuity including Monthly Compensation Allowance MCA and surcharge on late payment of 
gratuity, had not been made in the financial statements.
 (b) As the effective useful life for non-current assets had not been annually reviewed as per paragraph 65 of Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards 07, the non  current assets costing Rs. 365,974,993 were still in 
use despite being fully depreciated. Accordingly, the estimated error had not been revised as per Sri Lanka 
Public Sector Accounting Standards 03.
 (c) Without specifically stating the estimated life span for the office equipment related to the fixed assets, it had 
been stated as 03 to 05 years under the accounting policies. therefore, it was not possible to establish the 
accuracy of the depreciation calculation with respect to office equipment.
 (d) the expected future economic benefit period or depreciation percentage relating to the computer software 
costing Rs. 4,130,626 shown under intangible assets in the financial statements for the year under review had 
not been disclosed under accounting policies.

1146
 (e) Although the financial statements should be presented so as to ensure the consistency, the financial statements 
for the year under review had been prepared without inclusion of the specific fund accounts that had been 
included in the statement of changes inequity of the preceding year.
 (f) Although the stock of chemicals and glassware was worth Rs. 23,337,528 as per the stock verification reports 
as at 31st December of the year under review, that value had been stated as Rs. 19,974,934 in the financial 
statements, thus understating by Rs. 3,362,594.
 (g) the short term course income of Rs. 872,000 due for the year under review had not been brought to account.
 (h) According to the statement of financial position presented as at 31st December of the year under review, the 
balance of building and fittings maintenance stock was Rs. 1,199,787, whereas. according to the report of 
the Board of Survey as at that date, the balance of the stock was Rs. 579,940, thus observing a difference of  
Rs. 619,847.
  i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities,  
under  those standards are further described in  the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial 
Statements section of my report. i  believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.
 
 1.3 Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or  error.
  in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for  assessing the Uva Wellassa University’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
  those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.
  As per Sub-section 16(1) of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018, the University is required to maintai n proper 
books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial 
statements to be prepared  of the institute.
 1.4 Auditor’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgment  and maintain 
professional  scepticism throughout the audit. i also:
 • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulti ng from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Uva 
Wellassa University’s internal control.
 • Evaluate the appropriateness of  accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 • Conclude on the appropriateness  of  the  management’s  use  of  the going concern basis of accounting and based  
on  the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Uva Wellassa University’s ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, i am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the University to cease to continue as a going concern
  i  communicate  with  those charged   with governance   regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that  i identify during my audit.

temporary academic staff of the university were 96 and 73 respectively.
 (e) A trained technical Officer was recruited to the University on 01 April 2016 and from then until December 
of the year under review,  salaries  and  allowances amounting to Rs. 2,343,438 had been paid and two foreign 
training opportunities had also been provided at a cost of Rs. 345,017. Although it had been more than 03

identification of Sustainable Development Goals and Objectives for the year under review, the identification of 
indicators for measuring Sustainable Development Goals and targets, inclusion in the plans and maintenance 
of data had not been effected.
 (h) Since the water treated by the wastewater treatment system is not used for vehicle washing and various other 
maintenance activities, the University had spent Rs.22,313,316 on water consumption in the last four years.
 (i) the land 30.9667 hectares in extent belonging to the Ministry of industries, which was given for the 
establishment of the University as per the Cabinet Decision dated 10 february 2005, had not been taken over

using interest rates that are denominated  in  the currency m which the benefits  will  be paid,  and  that  have terms 
to maturity  approximating to the terms of  the related liability. the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
depends on a number of factors that are, determined on an actuarial basis using number of assumptions. Key 
assumptions used in determining the defined  retirement  benefit  obligations are given  in  Notes. Any changes  in  
these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of defined benefit obligations.

to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
 2.20.4   Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
  A  contingent  liability  is a  possible  obligation  that  arises  from  past  events  whose  existence  will  be 
continued  by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of  one or  more  uncertain  future events  beyond  the control 
of the programme or a present obligation  that is not recognized because  it is not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation.

reliably . the uncertainty does not recognize a contingent liability but disclose its existence in the financial 
Statements.

6.10  Report of the Auditor General
UVP/BD/D/UWU/ 2020/fS 02nd September,  2021
Vice Chancellor
Uva Wellassa University.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements and Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements of the 
Uva Wellassa University for the year ended 31 December, 2020 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit  
Act, No. 19 of 2018
1. financial Statements
 1.1 Qualified Opinion
  the audit of financial statements of the Uva Wellassa U niversity for the year ended 31 December  2020   comprising  
the statement  of  financial Position as at 31 December, 2020 and the statement of financial performance, statement 
of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year  then  ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions 
in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with 
provisions of the Sub-section 107 (5) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and the National Audit Act No. 19 
of 2018. My comments and observations which i consider to be presented in terms of Sub-section 108 (1) of the 
Universities Act, appear in this report. My report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the 
Constitution will be tabled in due course.
  in my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section  of my 
report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Uva Wellassa 
University as at 31 December 2020 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
 (a) Sums totaling Rs. 2,627,721,241 spent out of the capital grants received since year 2012 to the year under review 
had been credited of the Accumulated  funds Account instead of being credited to the Capital  Expenditure  
Account.  further, due to failure to annually amortize the capital grants spent from the Accumulated fund 
Account, Accumulated funds Account had been understated by Rs. 755,984,051 and due to not accounting 
for amortization of Rs. 109,007,627 related to the year under review, the  deficit of  the year had been  
overstated  by that amount in the financial statements.
 (b) the unspent Government capital  grants  amounting  to  Rs.  1,594,333 as  at 31 December of the year under 
review had been stated under the current liabilities instead of being stated under the equity in the statement 
of financial position.

PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 16.09.2022
1162
 (c) the balance of Rs. 870,272,961 in the spent capital grant account as at 31 December of the year under review 
had been stated as the deferred income under the non-current liabilities instead of being stated under the 
equity in the statement of financial position.
 
 (d) instead of withdrawing Rs. 392,051 from the Provision for Depreciation Accounting rectifying an error 
occurred relating to the buildings in the precedi ng year, a sum of Rs. 1,474,857 had been erroneously 
withdrawn and as a result,  net  value of the building had been understated by Rs. 1,082,806 in the financial 
statements.
 i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial 
Statements section of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for my opinion.
 1.3 Other information included in the Annual Report 2020 of the University
 the other information means the information included in the 2020 Annual Report of the Uva Wellassa University, 
which i obtained prior to the date of this report, but not contained in the financial Statements and my audit report 
thereon. Management is responsible  for  this  other information.
 My opinion on financial statements does not cover the other information  and  i  do  not express  any assurance  or 
opinion about them.
 My responsibility in connection with my audit of financial publications is to study the above identified other 
information and evaluate whether the other information is substantially mismatched with the financial statements 
or my knowledge gained in auditing or another manner.
 Based on the information i received prior to the date of this  auditor’s  report  and  the measures i have taken, if  
i conclude that this other information is substantially incorrect, i should  report that matter. i  have  nothing to report  
in this  connection.
 1.4 Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the financial Statements
 Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements  that give a  true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
 in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Uva Wellassa University’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative  but  to do so.
 those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the  Uva  Wellassa University’s  financial  reporting 
process.
 As per Sub- section  16(1)  of the National  Audit Act, No. 19  of  2018, the  Uva Wellassa University is required 
to maintain proper books and records of  all  its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and 
periodic financial statements to be prepared of the institute.
 1.5 Auditor’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and  to issue an Auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 

<!-- page 55 -->

I fldgi : (I) fPoh    ‑ YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha .eiÜ m;%h ‑ 2022'09'16
PART  I :  SEC.  (I) – GAZETTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 16.09.2022
1163
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial  statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing  Standards, i exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also:
 • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Uva 
Wellassa University’s internal control.
 • Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of   accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
 • Conclude on the appropriateness of  the  management’s  use  of  the going concern basis of accounting and based  
on  the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Uva Wellassa University’s ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, i am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the rela ted disclosures in 
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the University to cease to continue as a going concern
  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
  i  communicate  with  those charged  with governance  regarding, among  other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that i identify during my audit.
2.  Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
 2.1 National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 includes specific  provisions for following requirements.
 2.1.1 Except for the effect of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, i have obtained 
all  the  information and explanation that required for the audit and as far as appears from my examination,
