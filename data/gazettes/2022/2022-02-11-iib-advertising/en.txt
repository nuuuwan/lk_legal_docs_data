Finance PLC (PQ 131/PB/PQ) with LOLC 
Finance PLC (PB 244 PQ)
THE Boards of Directors of Commercial Leasing and

resolved to amalgamate CLC with LOFC and continue as

No. 7 of 2007, whereby the amalgamated entity, i.e. the 
surviving entity will be LOFC.

This amalgamation being part of the Financial Sector 
Consolidation Plan announced by the Central Bank of Sri 
Lanka, is subject to Special Resolutions to give eﬀ  ect to 
the amalgamation being passed by the shareholders of both 
amalgamating companies in terms of the Companies Act, 
No. 7 of 2007, LOFC receiving in principle approval of 
the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) for the issuance and 
listing of shares of LOFC arising from the amalgamation 
of CLC with LOFC in terms of the Listing Rules and the 
concurrence of the Secured Lenders being receiving by the 
amalgamating companies (as applicable).
The Amalgamation Proposal will be placed before the 
shareholders of both companies at Extraordinary General 
Meetings, for their approval, and upon such approval the 
amalgamation will take eﬀ ect on 31st March 2022. 
As per the Amalgamation Proposals, the holders of 
6,432,072,002 shares of CLC [being the number of shares, 
post amalgamation of Sinhaputhra Finance PLC with CLC] 
constituting 100% of the issued shares of CLC will be 
allotted shares of LOFC; the allocation proportion would be 
based on the Market Price of a share of CLC and LOFC, 
as at end of Trading, ﬁ ve (5) Market days, prior to the date 
ﬁ xed for both shareholders Meetings.
Based on the exchange value arrived as aforesaid, the 
shares to be issued in LOFC to the shareholders of CLC will 
be rounded to the nearest share.
Accordingly, the number of shares to be issued by LOFC 
would depend on the criteria set out in paragraph 4 hereof. 
According to the Valuation Report dated 21st January 
2022, issued by Capital Trust Partners (Pvt) Ltd, the 
value range (based on the number of shares prior to the 
amalgamation between Sinhaputhra Finance PLC (SFL) and 
CLC) of a Commercial Leasing and Finance PLC share for 
purposes of amalgamation is given as Rs. 10.40-39.30, and 
in respect of LOFC shares is given as Rs. 11.33-39.90. The 
number of shares of CLC post amalgamation will increase 
from 6,377,711,170 to 6,432,072,002 (approximately 
54,360,832 shares), the percentage attributable to existing 
SFL shareholders is 0.85% and the percentage attributable 
to existing CLC shareholders is 99.15%. 
In the Valuation Report, the Reference Price Range for an 
ordinary share of CLC has not considered the impact arising 
from the amalgamation between CLC and SFL. The net 
ﬁ nancial impact arising from the SFL and CLC amalgamation 
has not been quantiﬁ ed by the Company’s management as 
yet as the process is still underway. it must be noted that 
SFL’s Total Equity only amounts to approximately 3.52% of 
CLC’s Total Equity as per the interim ﬁ nancials as at 30th 
September 2021, and therefore Capital Trust Partners (Pvt) 
Ltd, has not considered the impact of the CLC and SFL 
amalgamation on the CLC Reference Price range reﬂ  ected 
in this report. 
Further the value for purposes of amalgamation/share 
exchange ratio is to be based on the Market Price of a share 
of CLC and LOFC, as at end of Trading, ﬁ  ve (5) Market 
days, prior to the date ﬁ xed for both shareholders Meetings. 
Based on the exchange value the shares to be issued in 
LOFC to the shareholders of CLC will be rounded to the 
nearest share, which basis of consideration is in the opinion 
of the Board fair and reasonable to LOFC and to the existing 
shareholders of LOFC.
Copies of the Amalgamation Proposals are available 
for inspection by any shareholder or creditor of CLC and 
LOFC or any person to whom LOFC and/or LOFC is under 
any obligation, at the Registered Oﬃ  ces of CLC/LOFC as
