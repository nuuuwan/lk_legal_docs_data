the amalgamation of lolc development finance 
plc (pb 263 pQ) with lolc finance plc 
(pb 244 pQ)
the Boards of Directors of LOLC Development Finance 
PLC (LODF) and LOLC Finance PLC (LOFC) resolved to 
amalgamate LODF with LOFC and continue as one entity in 
terms of Section 239 of the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007, 
whereby the amalgamated entity, i.e. the surviving entity 
will be LOFC.
This amalgamation being part of the Financial Sector 
Consolidation Plan announced by the Central Bank of Sri 
Lanka is subject to Special Resolutions to give effect to the 
amalgamation being passed by the shareholders of both 
amalgamating companies in terms of the Companies Act, 
No. 7 of 2007, LOFC receiving in-principle approval of 
the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) for the issuance and 
listing of shares of LOFC arising from the amalgamation 
of LODF with LOFC in terms of the Listing Rules, and the 
concurrence of the Secured Lenders being receiving by the 
amalgamating companies (as applicable).
The Amalgamation Proposal will be placed before the 
shareholders of both companies at Extraordinary General 
meetings, for their approval, and upon such approval, the 
amalgamation will take effect on 31st January 2023.
As per the Amalgamation Proposals, the holders of 
251,415,963 shares of LODF will be allotted shares of 
LOFC ; the allocation proportion would be based on the 
market Price of a share of LODF and LOFC, as at end of 
Trading five (5) market days, prior to the date fixed for both 
shareholders meetings.
The shares held by LOFC in LODF, shall not be converted 
into shares of LOFC. Accordingly, 105,498,948 shares held 
by LOFC in LODF constituting 29.56% of the issued shares 
of LODF will be cancelled without payment or the provision 
of other consideration.
Based on the exchange ratio arrived as aforesaid, the 
shares to be issued in LOFC to the shareholders of LODF 
will be rounded to the nearest share.

Accordingly, the number of shares to be issued by LOFC 
would depend on the criteria set out in paragraph 4 hereof.
According to the Valuation Report dated 9th December 
2022, issued by SC Securities (Pvt) Ltd, the value range of 
an LOLC Development Finance PLC share for purposes of 
amalgamation is given as Rs. 150.00-379.20, and in respect 
of LOFC shares is given as Rs. 3.84-16.04.
Further the value for purposes of amalgamation/share 
exchange ratio is to be based on the market Price of a share 
of LODF and LOFC, as at end of Trading, five (5) market 
days, prior to the date fixed for both shareholders meetings. 
Based on the exchange ratio the shares to be issued in LOFC 
to the shareholders of LODF will be rounded to the nearest 
shares, which basis of consideration is in the opinion of 
the Board fair and reasonable to LOFC and to the existing 
shareholders of LOFC.
Copies of the Amalgamation Proposals will be made 
available for inspection by any shareholder or creditor of
