Assets include the items acquired out of Government grant, research grants, internally generated funds, and 
donations.
 a) basis of Recognition and measurement
  Property, Plant and Equipment are recognized if it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be reliably measured. Properties, plant and 
equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. the cost of property, plant and equipment is 
the cost of purchase or construction together with any incidental expenses thereon.
 b) Cost
  the cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase or construction cost and any directly 
attributable cost of bringing the assets working condition for its intended use.
 c) Subsequent expenditure on existing fixed Assets
  Expenditure incurred on tangible fixed assets is charged to the Statement of financial Performance in 
the period it is incurred, unless it meets one of the following criteria, in which case it is capitalized and 
depreciates on the relevant basis:
  • Market value of fixed assets has subsequently increased,
  • Asset capacity increase,
  • Sustainable improvement in the quality of output or reduction in operating cost,
  • Significant extension of the asset life beyond that confirmed by repair and maintenance.
  d) Depreciation
  Depreciation is recognized in the Statement of financial Performance on a Straight – Line Method over the 
estimated useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment items from the date that they were made available for use. 
Lands are not depreciated. the estimated useful life periods are as follows.
 Description estimated useful life period
 Buildings 20 years
 Water treatment plant 20 years
 Road Network 20 years
 Office and teaching Equipment 5 years
 Computer & computer accessories 5 years
 Library Books and Periodicals 5 years
 Communication Equipment 5 years
 Motor Vehicles 5 years
 Cloaks 5 years
 Other Equipment 5 years
Depreciation is provided in full in the year of purchase and no depreciation is charged in the year of disposal. 
this method of depreciation is adopted in using the rates in the uGC circular 649 from the financial year 2006 and hope to 
continue in future.
Also this method of calculation of depreciation was approved by our Council at its 117th  meeting held on 
20.01.2007.
During the year 2020, following long term construction projects are completed and handed over to the university. 
these assets are included  in  Buildings  as capital assets and above depreciation policy applies from 2020.

 e) Capital Works in Progress
  Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. these are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the 
construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalization. Capital work-in-progress would be 
transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is available for use i.e., 
when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
the university.
 1.2.2 Intangible Assets
  An intangible asset is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected 
future economic benefits attributable that will flow to the university.
  intangible assets acquired are measured on initial recognition at cost.intangible assets are carried at cost less 
any accumulated amortization and  any accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized 
only when it increase the future economic benefits embodied in the assets. All other expenditure is expensed as 
incurred.
  All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life and amortized using straight line method to write 
down the cost of intangible asset to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows.
a. Computer software is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight-line basis.
b. Cost of development of new curriculum is amortised over a period of 5 years on Straight-line basis from 
the effective date of the new curriculum.
c. Patent is amortised over a period of 5 years on straight line basis.
 
  intangible assets represent the software purchased under the HEtC grant on their written down value and 
software purchased by the entity.
	 1.2.3	Curriculum Revision
  the university revises the curriculum for all degree programs in every five years and amendments are not 
making within that period. Hence, the expenditure incurred on capital funds are amortize over the five years 
period on the basis that the economic benefits would flow to the university during the effective period of the 
new syllabus. Since the faculty of Management Studies and faculty of Geomatics have implemented the revised 
curriculum w.e.f. 2015, the expenditure incurred on that are amortizes w.e.f. 2015.Also since the faculty of 
Agricultural Sciences and the faculty of Applied Sciences have implemented the revised curriculum w.e.f. 2016,
