INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE 
MEMBERS OF SRI LANKA INSTITUTE OF 
TAXATION
1.  Opinion
 We have audited the Financial Statements of Sri 
Lanka Institute of Taxation (“The Institute”), 
which comprise the statement of Financial Position 
as at 31st March 2022, and the Statement of 
comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in 
Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year 
ended, and a summary of signi ﬁ cant accounting 
policies and the other explanatory notes.
  In our opinion the accompanying Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view of the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Institute as at 31st March, 2022, 
and its Financial Performance and Cash Flows for 
the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Accounting Standard for Small and Medium-sized 
Entities (SLFRS for SMES).
2.  Basis of Opinion
 We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). 
 Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Organization 
in accordance with the ethical requirements of the 
Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of 
Ethics) that are relevant to our audit of the Financial 
Statements, and we have ful ﬁ lled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the Code of 
Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is suf ﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
3.  Responsibilities of Council’ s and those Charged 
with Governance for the Financial Statements
 The Council is responsible for the preparation of 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with Statement of Recommended 
Practice for Not-for-Pro ﬁ t Organisation, and for 
such internal control as Council determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of Financial 
Statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Revenue & Expenditure Returns
 In preparing the Financial Statements, Council 
is responsible for assessing the Organization’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
Council either intends to liquidate the Organization 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
 Those charged with governance are responsible 
for overseeing the Institution’s ﬁ nancial reporting 
process.
4.  Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue and Auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
an assurance of high level of assurance but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SLAuSs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to in ﬂ uence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Financial Statements.
 A further description of the Auditor’s responsibility 
for the audit of Financial Statements in located at Sri 
Lanka Accounting and Auditing website at : http://
www./slaasc.lk/auditing/auditorsresponsibility.
php. This description forms part of our auditor’s 
report.
5.  Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirement
 As required by section 7(7) of the Sri Lanka 
Institute of Taxation (Incorporation) Act, No. 21 
of 2000, we have obtained all the information and 
explanations that we required for the audit and 
as far as appears from our examination, proper 
accounting records have been kept by the institute.
