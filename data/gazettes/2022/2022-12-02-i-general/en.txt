2021 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31st December, 2021 and the statement of financial 
performance, statement of changes in net assets and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the

in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

finance Act, No. 38 of 1971. My 
report to Parliament in pursuane of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course.
  i n my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my 
report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the University as 
at 31st December, 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
(a) Assets costing Rs. 2,421,636,621 received from J iCA and A hEAD Projects had been indicated in the
statement of financial performance as the revenue from non-exchange transactions during the year under
review without adjusting retrospectively in terms of Sri Lanka Public Accounting Standard 3.
(b) t he useful lifetime of fixed assets had not been reviewed anually in terms of paragraph 65 of the Sri Lanka
Public Sector Accounting Standard 7. Vehicles and cloaks accounted under Property, Plant and Equipment
costing Rs. 78,957,863 had been fully depreciated but still being used by the end of the year under review. No 
action had been taken to recetify the estimated error in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting 
Standard 3.
(c) According to the paragraph 47 of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 7, when the fair value
of the revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is necessary. it may
be necessary to revalue the item every three or five years. however, Property, plant, equipment with the
aggregated amount of Rs. 7,288,976,743 had not been revalued for the past 7 years since 2014.
(d) Sum of Rs. 40,972,090 had been received as capital grant from treasury during the year under review had
not been recognised as revenue in terms of SLPSAS 11. As a result, the surplus from operating activities/
capital for the year had been understated by that similar amount in the 
financial Statement.
(e) An aggregated amount of Rs. 2,541,450 live stock had not been disclosed separately under non-current assets
as biological assets in the statement of financial position as per the requirement of Sri Lanka Public Sector
Accounting Standard 18. 
instead of, it had been accounted under Property, plant & equipment. As a results
he value of the Property, plant & equipment had been overstated by the similar amount.

(f) Expenditure on depreciation amounting to Rs. 1,065,410,866 relating to the year under review had been
adjusted in the statement of financial performance as non-operating expenditure instead of adjusting to the
operating expenditure of the year.
As such, profit earned from current operations and the profit earned from capital operations had been overstated 
and understated respectively in the financial statements during the year under review.
 i conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilties, under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor.s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements section 
of my report. i believe that the audit evidence i have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
my qualified opinion.
1.3 Other information included in the University’s 2021 Annual Report.
 the other information comprises the informatin included in the University.s 2021 Annual Report but does not 
include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon, which i have obtained prior to the date of this 
auditor’s report. Management is responsible for the other information.
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and i do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
 in connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
 if based on the work i have performed on the other information that i have obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s 
report, i conclude that there is  a material misstatement of this other information, i am required to report that fact. 
i have nothing to report in this regard.
1.4 Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
 in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing hte University’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
 those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.
As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the University is required to maintain proper books 
and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements 
to be prepared of the University.
1.5 Auditor’s Responsibilties for the Audit of the financial Statements
My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material missatement, whether due to fraud or error,and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonable assuarance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 

<!-- page 52 -->

1696
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statments.
As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also,
* i dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error,design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. 
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
* Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to desing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
University’s internal control.
* Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the management.
* Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
cast significant doubt on the University’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
if i conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, i am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. 
however, future events or conditions may cause the
University to cease to continue as a going concern.
* Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.
 i communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that i identify during my audit.

W. P. C. Wickramaratne,
Auditor General.
 Observation of the Governing Authority in respect of the issues highlighted in the report.
1. financial Statements
1.2 b asis for Opinion
(a) As per the SLPSAS 10 & 11 income received from exchange and non-exchange transaction has to be disclosed
as an income in that particular year only. Rs. 2,171,267,711 has been received as a donation from JiCA in 2021.
Even though physical building has been completed and equipment received from the project before 2021, official
handing over of the building had been done in 
february, 2021 by the Japanese Government to the University of
Jaffna. hence the official receipt of this donation amounting Rs. 2,171,267,711 had been received as donation in
2021 and reported to the council after officially received the assets from the Japanese Government. therefore,
even though the building was completed and equipment were received before 2021 official handing over of the
assets has happened only in 2021. Accordingly, proper accounting had been made for this transaction in the book
of accounts in 2021 as per SLPSAS 10 & 11.
(b) As per the SLPSAS 07 and SLPSAS 03 the residual value and the useful life of an asset shall be reviewed at
least at each annual reporting date. however, University of Jaffna has more than 11 categories of assets and some
of these categories (Lab & teaching Equipment and office Equipment) has more than one hundred thousand
individual items. the University has carried out one the revaluation for the 1st time in 2014 by a firm of Chartered
accountants firm for the purpose of computerization at a cost of more than Rs. 5 million taking more than 5
years and updated the fixed assets registrar. Reviewing the useful life of these assets annually for the purpose
of depreciation will not be practical as it time consuming and costly exercise which is not expected to bring a
significant impact on the financial statemets. Considering these aspects the Audit Committee at its 70th meeting
held on 22nd April, 2022 recommended to the council to initiate a policy to adopt the cost model taking the
revalued amount as deemed cost changing the depreciation policy appropriately with the approved of the UGC.
the Council is in apparent with this arrangement. Currently the depreciation has been calculated according to
the UGC circular No. 649 of 05.10.1995 which specify the useful life of the assets for each category. this will be
reviewed in consultation with the UGC from 2022 onwards with the justifiation for deviating from the Accounting
standard with appropriate disclosure.
(c) Same as (b) above.
(d) t he amount received from the treasury as a Capital grant has been properly taken to the account and disclosed
as revenue in the income statement. Rs. 40,972,090 reflected in the report was received from various sources
such as well-wishers, donors and income from restricted fund. When assets were purchased using other sources 
of funds the assets and the income are shown in the respective self-financing courses. Since it is related to the 
continuing Self-finance courses.
(e) Although the biological assets had been recognized, measured and kept in a separate ledger account properly
in terms of SLPSAS 18, for the reporting purpose the live stocks have been included and disclosed along with
Property, plant and equipment as a practice. Action had been taken to disclose the livestock as a separate line
item under non-current assets in the future.
(f) Depreciation being a noncash expenditure not funded by treasury and not considered for financial performance of
the University, we have been showing this as non-operating expenditure in the financial statement as a practice.
the amounts of depreciation for the year 2021 amount to Rs. 1,065,410,866. however, action will be taken to
show the depreciation as an operating expense in the future.

02. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
2.2.2
(a) f inancial Regulation of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
(i) As per the financial regulation 267 staff salaries are remitted to their bank account as per the written
confirmation given by the employees. Every month while remitting the salaries to the staff bank account
we are sending the payment details clearly to each of them through their heads of departments. Up to
data salaries were made to the individual employee’s bank account properly and we did ot receive any
complaint from any employees as they have not received their salary.
 the salary slips sent monthly to the individual employees through their department head are received and 
acknowledged monthly and returned to the finance branch properly. however, there had been instances 
where some of the employees are receiving their colleague’s salary slips due to the study leave, medical 
leave and some other reason and acknowledging with their own signature without attaching their colleagues 
request letter to collect their salary slip. Strict action has been initiated to avoid this practice and internal 
circular dated 19.05.2021 had been issued to all staff informing the procedure needs to be followed when 
they are collecting the colleague.s salary slips. Proper internal control mechanism has been accelerated 
to monitor this process closely.
(ii) (i) Due to the Covid 19 pandemic situation most of the institution had shut down their operations
cotinuously. University of Jaffna also completely closed for certain period continously for one to one 
and half months. Due to this most of the officers who were taken the advances for certain purposes were 
unable to commence and complete their program as they planned. Due to this the advance settlements 
had been delayed. 
however, we have ensured that all advances taken during the period of 2021 itself.
Also, we have taken proper control mechanism to monitor the advances and ensure the settlement of 
the advances as soon as the event is completed. Strict action has been taken and internal circulars had 
been issued to all the staff to educate them to settle their advances on time.
 (ii) When the staff is making advance request for any event costing more than Rs. 100,000 they request
the full amount of the expense as an advance since they are unable to finance the remaining amount
is excess of Rs. 100,000 from their own money. 
internal circulars have already been issued to educate
the staff in advance the procedure, to be followed, regarding the limits, approval and settlement. Proper
mechanism has already been implemented to supervise and monitor the advances strictly.
(b) Procurement manual of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (Goods & Works)
While calling the quotation procurement procedures have been followe properly and bid security had been called

Council at its 433rd meeting held on 16.12.2018 decided to withdraw the letter of acceptance of resignation 
based on the humanitarian grounds. Since her period of service had not been interrupted, Sabbatical leave 
was granted which is an entitlement of an employee, for the period from 30.05.2019 to 29.05.2020 for 1st 
instance and up to 29.01.2021 as an extension of earned sabbatical leave. She resumed duties on 29.01.2021 
after the sabbatical leave and she used the entire sabbatical leave to write and publish a book titled “Medical 
plants of Jaffna Peninsula” and to recover from the severe life-threatening medical complications. 
it is 
noted that, just prior to the sabbatical leave she was granted medical leave for the period from 08.02.2017 
to 07.02.2018 and vacation leave from 07.03.2018 to 04.05.2018 while referring her to medical board and 
considering the recommendation of the medical board. 
it is also emphasized that revoking the acceptance 
resignation (24.12.2018) with in three month period of the request for resignation (26.09.2018) by the Council 
on humanitarian grounds is well justifiable and reasonable. Because of the revoking of resignation, she did not 
lose her continuity of the service and thus her entitlement for sabbatical leave was considered favorably and 
sabbatical leave was granted. Vehicle permit and other benefits also granted to Mrs. J. Nandakumar based on 
the above justification. 
this has been adequately explained in our reply.

on Measure and Pay basis. Although the original estimated cost was prepared for 5 storied building in 2009,
the bids were called in April 2013. Due to the gap of 3 years between the preparation of estimate and invitation
for bid, the scope of this project had to be limited to 3 floors with foundation for 5 storied building.

78,855,000.00 excluding V At with the approval of Ministry Procurement Committee.
