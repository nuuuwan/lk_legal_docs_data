  those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the institute financial reporting process.
  As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the institute is required to maintain proper books and 
records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to be 
prepared of the institute.
 1.5 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial Statements
  My objective is to obtain reasonable assurasurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. 
Reasonble assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
  As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, i exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. i also:
 * identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for my opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
 * Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the institute’s internal 
control.
 * Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
 * Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use,of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the institute ability to continue as a going concern. if i conclude that a material uncertainty exists, i am 
required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of my auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the institute to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
 * Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
  i communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings, 
including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that i identify during my audit. 
2. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
 2.1 National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 includes specific provisions for following requirements.
  2.1.1 i have obtained all the information and explanation that required for the audit and as far as appears from my 
examination, proper accounting records have been kept by the institute as per the requirement of Section 12 (a)
