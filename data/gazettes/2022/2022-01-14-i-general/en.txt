internally generated funds, and donations. 
  in order to receive the ownership of the land at homagama, Pitipana, Mahahenawatta provided by the 
Government to construct the Faculty of technology, the university is requested to pay Rs.731 Million to the 
uDA.
 (a) basis of Recognition and measurement
  Property, Plant and Equipment are recognized if it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be reliably measured. 
  All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are recognized in the 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. the carrying value of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
 (b) Initial Recognition
  Equipment is capitalized on the basis of nature. Equipment is capitalized if it is tangible, has a life of 
more than one year and has a purchase cost greater than Rs.2,500. the life of an asset is dependent on its 
category within 8 categories, ranging from 4 to 20 years.
 (c) Subsequent Expenditure on Existing Property, Plant and Equipment

measured reliably has been carried at revalued amounts, being fair value at the date of revaluation less any 
subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Land & Buildings, 
Motor Vehicles, Office equipment, Lab & teaching Equipment, Furniture & Fittings, Sports Goods.
 (e) Depreciation

estimated useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment items from the date that they were made available 
for use. Lands are not depreciated. the estimated useful life periods are as follows.
 Description estimated useful life period
 1. Buildings 20 years
 2. Furniture &Equipment 10 years

is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of minimum lease 
payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments under finance leases are apportioned between 
the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. the finance expense is allocated to each 
period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability.
 (g) maintenance of Premises
  the university has a maintenance plan which is reviewed periodically and forms the basis of the on-going 
maintenance of the assets. the cost of maintenance is charged to the income and Expenditure Account as 
incurred.
 2.2.2 Capital Works in Progress

directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalization. Capital work-
in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is 
available for use i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the university.
 2.2.3 Intangible Assets
  Computer Software
  Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to 
use. these costs are amortized over their estimated useful life of five (5) years. 
  Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognized as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with
  the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the university are recognized as 
intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
 1. it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

  Employee Benefits
 (a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan – Gratuity
  Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan. the defined 
benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected unit Credit (PuC) method. the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, 
using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions about discount rate, future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the longterm nature 
of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. 
  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based 
on the actuarial valuation as of 31st December, 2018. the university accounting policy for gratuity is 
to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other 
comprehensive income.
  Retirement Benefit Obligation
  Actuarial and Management Consultant (Pvt) Ltd, qualified actuaries has done actuarial valuation on 
the defined benefit plan – Gratuity as at 31-12-2018. the assumptions used in determining the cost of 
retirement benefits are as follows.
  Rate of discount 11% p.a. 
  Rate of salary increased 
  Academic staff  10% p.a.
  Non Academic staff 8% p.a.

Vice Chancellor,
university Of Colombo.
Report of the Auditor General on the financial Statements and other legal and monitoring requirements of university 
Of Colombo for the year ended 31st December 2018 in terms of section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.
1. financial Statements
 1.1  Qualified Opinion
 
  the audit of financial statements of the university of Colombo for the year ended 31st December 2018 comprising 
the statement of financial position as at 31st December 2018 and the statement of financial performance, statement 
of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory notes was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 
(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with section 12 of 
the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. My report will be tabled in the parliament in due course in terms of Article 
154 (6) of the Constitution.
  in my opinion, except of the matters described in the paragraph on “ Basis for Qualified Opinion” of this report 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the university of Colombo as at 31 
December 2018 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  the following were observed regarding this.
 a)  Although the value of pre payments of the Faculty of Finance and Management in the year under review had 
been Rs. 487,670 , it had been recorded in the financial statements as Rs. 431,051, thus undervaluing it by  
Rs. 56,619.
 b)  An amount of Rs. 955,718,850 had been indicated as receivable from treasury under sundry debtors. But no 
consent of the treasury had been expressed to grant this.
 c)  the value of the balance receivable amounting to Rs. 139,240,643 from the faculties of the university and other 
sections has been recorded as debtors.
 d)  Although loss at disposal of assets had been Rs. 621,955, it had been recorded in the financial statements as  
Rs. 4,175,980. Consequently, a difference of Rs. 3,554,025 existed.
 e)  According to schedules, the investment value had been Rs. 1,783,293,156. But it had been mentioned in the 
financial statements as 1,783,693,156. this has resulted in a difference of Rs. 400,000.
 1.3  Responsibility of management and Controlling Parties for the financial Statements
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the management determines

72
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether 
due to fraud or error.
  it is the responsibility of the management to decide on the going concern ability of the institution in preparation 
of financial statements. Keeping accounts on a going concern basis and disclosure of the facts in relation to the 
going concern of the institution except in case the management intends to liquidize the institution or it is intended 
to cease operation in the absence of any other option.
  the controlling parties of the institution are responsible for the financial reporting system. 
  According to the subsection 16 (1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, every auditee entity shall maintain 
proper books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic 
financial statements to be prepared in respect of such entity.
 1.4  Responsibility of auditor on auditing financial statements
  My objective is to provide a fair assurance on the financial statements that they are free from material misstatements 
whether due to fraud or error as a whole and to issue the auditor’s report comprising my opinion. Although fair 
assurance is a high quality assurance, it does not confirm that it would always expose quantitative misstatements 
when auditing is implemented in accordance with Sri Lanka Audit Standards. it is expected that individual or 
collective impact of fraud or error may result in quantitative misstatements and it may have an effect on the 
decisions taken by the users based on these financial statements.
  this audit has been carried out by me with professional judgment and professional scepticism. Also,
 •  Obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to avoid risks caused by fraud or error by designing 
appropriate audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances in recognizing and evaluating possible 
misstatements that may occur in financial statements due to fraud or error is the basis of my opinion. Fraud will 
have a higher impact than that of quantitative misstatements and collusion, preparation of fake documents, 
intentional avoidance and avoidance of internal controls may result in fraud.
 •  the auditor considered internal control relevant to the institution in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
internal control of the institution.
 •  the audit included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by management as well as the eligibility of the related disclosures made by the 
management.
 •  the relevance of using the basis of going concern was determined based on the audit evidence obtained 
on whether there is a sufficient contingency on the going concern of the institution due to any incident or 
circumstances. in case i conclude that there is a sufficient contingency, my audit report should attend to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements and my opinion must be modified in case the disclosures are 
not sufficient enough. however, going concern may end due to future incidents or circumstances.
 •  Presentation, structure and content of the financial statements with disclosures was assessed and underlying 
transactions and events were evaluated for whether they were included in the financial statements in an 
appropriate and reasonable manner.

  it was revealed in the sample inspection that a proper Leave Register had not been maintained for the 
academic staff of the Faculty of Science, although such register should be maintained on the leave 
obtained by the staff.
  Although the arrival and departure of all the academic and non- academic staff should be recorded, 
618 academic officers had been paid salaries and allowances totaling up to Rs. 677,219,763 in the 
year under review, without establishing their attendance and leave obtained.
 ( c)  circular 13/2015 dated 18 September of 2015 of university Grants Commission 
  Although the fuel allowance paid for the vehicles assigned for the entitled officers should be added to the 
monthly salary of the relevant officers, fuel for the reserved vehicles had been supplied out of the fuel order 
of the university, without paying a fuel allowance to the relevant officers. As such an excessive amount of Rs. 
1,905,898 had been paid other than the fuel allowance.
 2.3  According to the requirements of section 12 (g) of National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the auditee entity has not

 2.4 According to the requirements of section 12 (h) of National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, except for the following 
observations, the resources of the auditee entity had been procured and utilized economically, efficiently and 
effectively within the time frames and in compliance with the applicable laws.
 ( a) it was revealed that supplying of commodities valuing up to Rs. 16,434,490 had been delayed from 02 
months to 11 months. this was revealed in the Sample inspection of Commodity Orders Relating to 2018 
in the Supplies Branch.
 ( b)  Although an amount of Rs. 12,441,324 had been granted by the Embassy of japan to purchase practical 
training equipment for the Department of journalism of the Sripalee Campus, that amount had not been 
utilized for that purpose until May, 2019.
 ( c)  An invitation for bids had been published in 03 newspapers to renovate KG hall of the Faculty of Science 
and to repair the roof of it. Due to the contradictions in the advertisements, an amended notice had to be 
published regarding this. Consequently, the institution had to bear a loss of Rs. 229,185 and selection of 
bidders had been delayed by another month.
3. Other Observations
 ( a)  although the approval of the cabinet should be granted with the recommendation of the university Grants 
Commission before establishing a company within the institution, a limited by guarantee company has 
been established without such permission in the name of Colombo Science and technology Cell in 2013 
under the companies’ Act. the head Office of this Company had been housed in a building belonging to 
the Faculty of Science of the university of Colombo and the other physical and human resources including 
computer and accessories of the university had been utilized, whereas an agreement had not been entered 
into on the utilization of the property of the university. Only a sum of Rs. 479,684 had been paid to the 
university in lieu of the utilization of the resources of the university.

review in the “ Designated Fund” which consists of 123 funds , had been underutilized.
 ( c)  4 deposits Rs. 55,000,000 in worth out of 07 deposits totalling up to Rs. 305,000,000 in worth, that had 
been invested in Seven-day demand deposit at an interest rate of 5.5% had not been encashed for 03 months.

A minimum interest income of 10.5% could have been gained if this amount had been deposited in quarterly 
deposits. Consequently, the possibility of earning an income of Rs. 933,425 had been neglected.
 ( d)  When the number of students who applied for the hostel facilities was compared with the number of students 
who obtained hostel facilities in the university, granting hostel facilities to the students was in a minimum 
level. A minimal level of 22%, 40%, 44% and 33% of students who applied for the hostel facilities had 
been granted accommodation, consecutively from first year to the fourth year students. it was observed 
that 243 more students could have been granted accommodation in 06 hostels. Further, 02 hostels had been 
obtained on lease basis and an amount of Rs. 5,400,000 had been paid as lease in the year under review. it 
was observed that the actual number of hostelers in these hostels were 55, although 108 students could be 
accommodated in them. in addition, the hostel of the monks is run in a private building since 2006 on lease 
basis and an amount of Rs. 3,900,000 had been paid in as lease in 2018, as the monthly rent was 325,000. 
it was observed that the actual number of student monks in this hostel was 55, although 50 monks could be 
accommodated in it. 
 ( e)  Even though the student capacity of the Faculty of Science had been 515, only 501 students had been 
enrolled to the faculty, thus preventing university entrance of 14 students. Although 520 students could 
have been enrolled in the Faculty of Management, only 515 students had been enrolled and consequently 05 
students had been deprived of enrolling in the university.
 (f)  Although the uGC had been informed that the capacity of the Faculty of Arts had been 550, the actual 
enrolment of the faculty had been 713 and this was an increase of 29.6% over the number reported to the 
uGC.
 (g)  A sum of Rs. 52,650,521 remained receivable on 31st December 2018 from 25 lecturers who had breached 
the agreements and bonds.
 ( h)  Approved cadre of Professors and Lectures of the university had been 723 in the end of the year under 
review. Since the actual number was 586, there were 137 vacancies, including 27 vacancies for the post of 
Senior Professor. 183 posts of the nonacademic staff remained vacant.
 ( i)  An amount of Rs. 565,000,000 had been received from the treasury as capital grants and out of that, an 
amount of Rs. 141,820,522 had been spent on recurrent expenditure. this has been 18.76% of the total 
capital grant.
 ( j)  A Senior Professor in the Department of Plant Sciences had obtained medical leave , vacation leave and 
sabbatical leave due to an illness from time to time. he had reported to the duty in 03 occasions in 2015, 
2017 and 2018. Although it was explained that he had delivered lectures and monitored researches, no 
evidence has been provided to the auditing to establish this information. No lecture hours had been allocated 
for this lecturer in the academic time table for the year 2018. An amount of Rs. 3,397,055 had been paid to 
him as salary and allowances for a time period of 09 months. Also, a lecturer of the Faculty of Science had 
been paid Rs. 1,012,674 as salary and allowances although he had not delivered lectures, since his date of 
retirement could not be determined.

 2.3.4  Provision for Retirement Benefits 
    Employee Benefits 
    (a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan – Gratuity
    Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan.  The defined 
benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method.  The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, 
using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability.  The present value of the defined benefit 
obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions about discount rate, future salary increments and mortality rates.  Due to the long-term nature 
of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
    
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.  Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based 
on the actuarial valuation as of 31stDecember 2019.The University accounting policy for gratuity is to 
recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other 
Financial Performance. 
    Retirement Benefit Obligation 
    Actuarial and Management Consultant (Pvt) Ltd, qualified actuaries has done actuarial valuation on the 
defined benefit plan – Gratuity as at 31-12-2019.  The assumptions used in determining the cost of retirement 
benefits are as follows.
 Rate of discount  10.5% p.a.
 Rate of salary increased
 Academic staff  10% p.a.
 Non Academic staff  8% p.a.
 Retirement age
 Academic Staff  65 yrs
 Non Academic staff  60 yrs
    Defined Obligations
     Sensitivity analysis to discount rate –
     One percentage point increase -Rs.1,289,401,296
     One percentage point decrease -Rs.1,529,623,024
     Sensitivity analysis to salary escalation rate –
     One percentage point increase -Rs.1,529,689,222
     One percentage point decrease -Rs.1,287,429,169
    Gratuity Expenditure 
    As per Commission Circular No.05/2019 dated June 04, 2019, informed that the Academic Allowance and 
MCA should be taken into the calculation of Gratuity in terms of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983 for Academic 
staff members and Non Academic staff members respectively with effect from 01-06-2019.  As a result of 
that substantial increase in deficit occurred during the year 2019.  It has resulted in a large increase in the

and section 18 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 which should be read in conjugation with Article 154 (1) of 
the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 
of 2018. My report will be tabled in the parliament in due course in terms of Articles 154 (6) of the Constitution.
  In my opinion, except of the matters described in the paragraph on “Basis for Qualified Opinion” of this report 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the University of Colombo as at 31 
December 2019 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Public Sector Accounting Standards.
 1.2 Basis for Qualified Opinion
  a) Five projects that have been already completed totaling up to Rs. 19,627,090 had been accounted under work 
in progress in spite of a time lapse of 5 to 11 months after the completion of the same projects. A due amount 
of Rs. 13,554,963 for 04 projects had not been recorded in the accounts.
  b) A total amount of Rs. 10,310,841 that should have been capitalized under buildings had been accounted under 
recurrent expenditure. Consequently, the deficit and the building value of the Financial Statements were 
overvalued and undervalued respectively by the same amount.
  c) Since the assets had not been categorized accurately in accounts, both the amortization value related to the year 
and the deficit of the year had been reduced by Rs. 1,344,012.
  d) When the income obtained by the differed courses and Research and various units were compared with the 
relevant annexures, respectively an imbalance of Rs. 14,565,700 and Rs. 5,341,127 were observed. Yet, no 
explanation was given for the audit regarding those imbalances.
  e) Although the investment interest income should have been Rs. 237,168,553 as per 31st December 2019, the 
same balance has been recorded in the Statement of Financial Performance as Rs. 237,943,303. Consequently, 
the annual interest income and due interest income have been increased by Rs. 774,750 in the Financial 
Statements.
 1.3 Responsibility of management and Controlling Parties for the financial statements.
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for determining the internal controls which are necessary 
to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or 
error.
  It is the responsibility of the management to decide on the going concern ability of the University in preparation of 
Financial Statements. It is also a responsibility of the management to keep accounts on a going concern basis and 
disclosure of the facts in relation to the going concern of the University except in case the management intends to 
liquidate the University or it is intended to cease operation in the absence of any other option.
 
 The controlling parties of the University are responsible for the financial reporting system.
 According to the Sub section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, University shall maintain proper 
books and records of all its income, expenditure, assests and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial 
statements to be prepared in respect of the University.

 1.4 Responsibility of  the auditor in the audit of financial statements
  My objective is to provide a fair assurance on the Financial Statements that they are free from material misstatements 
as a whole whether due to fraud or error and to issue the auditor’s report comprising my opinion. Although fair 
assurance is a high quality assurance, it does not confirm that it would always expose quantitative misstatements 
when the audit is done in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. It is expected that individual or collective 
impact of fraud or error may result in quantitative misstatements and it may have an effect on the decisions taken 
by the users based on these financial statements.
  This audit has been carried out by me with professional judgement and professional scepticism. Also,
• Obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to avoid risks caused by fraud or error by designing 
appropriate audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances in recognizing and evaluating possible 
misstatements that may occur in Financial Statements due to fraud or error is the basis of my opinion. Fraud 
will have a higher impact than that of material misstatements and collusion, preparation of fake documents, 
international avoidance and avoidance of internal controls may result in fraud.
• The auditor considered internal controls relevant to the University in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
internal controls of the institution.
• The audit included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by management as well as the suitability of the related disclosures made by the 
management.
• The relevance of using the going concern basis for accounting purpose was determined based on the audit 
evidence obtained on whether there is a sufficient contingency on the going concern of the University due to 
events or circumstances. In case I conclude that there is a sufficient contingency, my audit report should attend 
to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements and my opinion must be modified in case the disclosures 
are not sufficient enough. However, going concern may end due to future events or circumstances.
• Presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements with disclosures was assessed and underlying 
transactions and events were evaluated for whether they were included in the financial Statements in an 
appropriate and reasonable manner. 
  The controlling parties were made aware of the important audit findings, major internal control weaknesses and 
other facts recognized in the audit.
2. Report on other legal and monitoring Requirements
  Special provisions are included regarding the following requirements in the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.
  - I have obtained all the information and explanations required for the audit according to the requirements of

The  project  helps  to  share  knowledge  related  to 
agro-eco  system  resilience  among  partners  and 
mix  them  with  new  knowledge  to  develop  new 
strategies    for    resilience    building    of    agro- 
ecosystems  in  Sri  Lanka.  These  programs  will 
help      to      strengthen      ecosystem      resilience 
development activities that will increasingly build the  
capacity  of  professionals to  develop  a  master degree   
program   curriculum   at   the   end   of   the project.
BRITAE   claims   that   the   knowledge   gap   is 
profound   and   skewed   in   favour   of   developed 
countries and developing countries struggle from a 
lack  of  both  financial  and  human  resources  in 
research  and  innovation  in  the  field  of  building 
resilience  in  tropical  agro  eco-systems.  The  need 
to advance their capability to produce knowledge 
domestically  and  absorb  the  knowledge  for  the 
capacity building  in the field of higher  education is 
addressed.

In order to receive the ownership of the land  at Homagama, Pitipana, Mahahenawatta provided by the Government 
to construct the Faculty of Technology, the  University is requested to pay Rs.731 Million to the UDA  and the 
Ministry of Education agreed to pay this amount.
(a) Basis of Recognition and Measurement
Property, Plant and Equipment are recognized if it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the  
item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be  reliably measured.
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the Statement of Financial 
Performance as incurred. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment are reviewed  for impairment when 
events or changes in circumstances  indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable.
(b) Initial Recognition
Equipment costing less than Rs.2,500 per individual item is typically written-off in the year of purchase.All other 
Equipment is capitalized on the basis of nature. Equipment  is capitalized if it is tangible, has a life of more than 
one year. The life of an asset is dependent on its category within 8 categories, ranging from 4 to 20 years.
(c) Subsequent Expenditure on Existing Property, Plant and Equipment
Expenditure incurred on tangible fixed assets is charged  to the Statement of Financial Performance in the 
period it is incurred, unless it meets one of the following  criteria, in which it is capitalized and is depreciated 
on the relevant basis:
1. Market value of fixed assets has subsequently increased,
2.  Asset capacity increase,
3. Sustainable improvement in  the  quality  of output or reduction in operating cost,
4. Significant extension of  the asset  life beyond that has already been confirmed by repair and maintenance.
(d) Revaluation Model

as finance leases. On initial recognition, the  leased assets under property, plant and equipment, is  measured at an 
amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, the asset is accounted for  in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Minimum lease payments under finance leases are  apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction  of 
the outstanding liability. The finance expense is  allocated to each period during the lease term so as to  produce a 
constant periodic rate interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
During the year university paid Rs.2.6 Million as lease  rental.
(h) Maintenance of Premises
The University has a maintenance plan which is reviewed  periodically and forms the basis of the on-going  
maintenance of the assets. The cost of maintenance is  charged to the Statement of Performance.

nature, directly incurred in the construction of property,  plant and equipment awaiting capitalization. Capital   
work-in-progress would be transferred to the relevant  asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it  
is available for use i.e. when it is in the location and  conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in  
the manner intended by the University. Financial costs are not capitalized at part of additions to the  fixed  assets.

2.3.4 Provision for Retirement Benefits 
Employee Benefits
(a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan – Gratuity
Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit 
is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, 
using interest rates that are denominated in the  currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have  terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the  related liability. The present value of  the  defined  benefit obligations 
depends on a number of factors that  are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of  assumptions about 
discount rate, future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates 
are subject to significant uncertainty.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.  Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based on  the 
actuarial valuation as of 31st December, 2020. The  University accounting policy for gratuity is to recognize  
actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other Financial Performance.
Retirement Benefit Obligation
Actuarial and Management Consultant (Pvt) Ltd,  qualified actuaries has done actuarial valuation on the  defined 
benefit plan – Gratuity as at 31-12-2020. The  assumptions used in determining the cost of retirement  benefits are 
as follows.
Staff Turnover
Academic staff  1% p.a. 
Non Academic staff 0.50% p.a.
Rate of discount 10% p.a.
Rate of salary increased
Academic staff 7% p.a.
Non Academic staff 5% p.a.
Retirement age
Academic Staff 65 yrs
Non Academic staff 60 yrs
Defined   Obligations
In order to illustrate the significance of the discount rate  and salary escalation rate assumed in the valuation as at  31 
December 2020, conducted a sensitivity analysis for  all employees assuming the following discount rates and  salary 
escalation rate.

Report on the Auditor General on the Financial Statements and other legal and monitoring requirements of University of 
Colombo for the year ended 31st December 2020 in terms of section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.
1. Financial Statements
 1.1  Qualified Opinion

the Statement of Financial Position as at 31st December, 2020 and the Statement of Financial Performance and

laid down by section 20 of the Ordinance of University of Colombo No. 1 of 1980 vested upon by subsection 107 
(5) and section 108 (1) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 which should be read in conjugation with Article 
154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and section 12 of the of the National 
Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018. My report will be tabled in the parliament in due course in terms of Article 154 (6) of 
the Constitution. 
  In my opinion, except of the matters described in the paragraph on “Basis for Qualified Opinion” of this report 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the University of Colombo as at 31st 
December, 2020 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards.
	 1.2		Basis	for 	Qualified	Opinion
 a)  As per paragraph 54 of the No. 07 in Sri Lanka Public Audit Standards, revaluation increases and decreases 
relating to assets within a class of property, plant and equipment must not be offset in respect of assets 
in different classes. Yet, the revaluation deficit of office equipment of Sri Palee Campus totaling to  
Rs. 5,437,395 had been offset to the revaluation surplus of laboratory and teaching equipment. Consequently, 
revaluation revenue and annual surplus have been understated and overstated in the Financial Statements 
by the same amount.
 b)  In contrary with the provisions of the paragraph 55 of the No. 07 in Sri Lanka Public Auditing Standards, an 
amount of Rs. 42,248,667 in asset evaluation revenue has been adjusted to the revenue of the Statement of 
Financial Performance under Amortization of Capital Grants and thereby, the annual surplus and revaluation 
revenue have been overstated and understated in the Financial Statements by the same amount.
 c)  No action had been taken to re- review property, plant, equipment and intangible assets that have already 
been totally depreciated yet still in use totalling to Rs. 80,706,090 and to state them in the Financial 
Statements as per No.3 of Sri Lanka Public Auditing Standards.
 d)  Though the depreciation percentage of the sports equipment is 25% as per the depreciation policy on 
property, plant and equipment, depreciation has been calculated in 17 instances in contrary to the above 
provisions, thus making an under provision of Rs. 1,299,182 in depreciation of the year under review. 
Accordingly, the surplus of the year under review and the net value of sports equipment had been overstated 
by the said amount. 
  I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. My responsibilities, under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
section of my report. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate enough 
to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.
 1.3.  Other Information in the Annual Report of the university -2020
  Other information refers to the information obtained by me before the date of this report that are included in the 
annual report of the university -2020, yet not available in my audit report. The management is responsible for this 
other information.
  My opinion of the Financial Statements does not cover this other information and I do not confirm or express 
an opinion regarding that. My responsibility regarding the auditing of the Financial Statements is to reading the 
above recognized other information and to consider whether other information quantitatively contradict with my 
knowledge obtained through the Financial Statements, auditing or in any other means. I have nothing to report in 
this regard.
 1.4  Responsibility of Management and Controlling Parties for the Financial Statements
  Managem ent is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards and for determining the internal controls which are necessary 

<!-- page 181 -->

191
to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud 
or error.
  It is the responsibility of the management to decide on the going concern ability of the university in preparation of 
Financial Statements. It is also a responsibility of the management to keep accounts on a going concern basis and 
disclosure of the facts in relation to the going concern of the university except in case the management intends to 
liquidate the university or it is intended to cease operation in the absence of any other option.
  The controlling parties of the university are responsible for the financial reporting system.
  According to the subsection 16 (1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, university shall maintain proper 
books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial 
statements to be prepared in respect of the university.
 1.5.  Responsibility of the Auditor in the audit of Financial Statements
  My objective is to provide a fair assurance on the Financial Statements that they are free from material misstatements 
as a whole whether due to fraud or error and to issue the Auditor’s Report comprising my opinion. Although fair 
assurance is a high quality assurance, it does not confirm that it would always expose quantitative misstatements 
when the audit is done in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. It is expected that individual or collective 
impact of fraud or error may result in quantitative misstatements and it may have an effect on the decisions taken 
by the users based on these financial statements.
  This audit has been carried out by me with professional judgement and professional scepticism. Also,
 •  Obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to avoid risks caused by fraud or error by designing appropriate 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances in recognizing and evaluating possible misstatements 
that may occur in Financial Statements due to fraud or error is the basis of my opinion. Fraud will have a higher 
impact than that of material misstatements and collusion, preparation of fake documents, international avoidance 
and avoidance of internal controls may result in fraud.
 •  The auditor considered internal controls relevant to the university in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
internal controls of the institution. 
 •  The audit included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by management as well as the suitability of the related disclosures made by the management.
 •  The relevance of using the going concern basis for accounting purpose was determined based on the audit evidence 
obtained on whether there is a sufficient contingency on the going concern of the university due to events or 
circumstances.
  In case I conclude that there is a sufficient contingency, my audit report should attend to the related disclosures 
in the Financial Statements and my opinion must be modified in case the disclosures are not sufficient enough. 
However, going concern may end due to future events or circumstances.
 •  Presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements with disclosures was assessed and underlying 
transactions and events were evaluated for whether they were included in the Financial Statements in an 
appropriate and reasonable manner.
  The controlling parties are made aware of the important audit findings, major internal control weaknesses and 
other facts recognized in the audit.
