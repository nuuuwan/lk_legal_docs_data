in Sri Lanka transacts life insurance business in Sri Lanka,
whether directly or through an agent, the profits therefrom
shall be ascertained by reference to such proportion of the
total investment income of the Life Insurance Fund of the
company, as is equal to the proportion which the premiums
from life insurance business in Sri Lanka bear to the total life

reason of the limited extent of the business transacted in Sri
Lanka by a non-resident insurance company, it would be
unreasonable to require the company to furnish the particulars
necessary for the application of subsections (1) and (2), he
may notwithstanding the provisions of such subsections,
permit the profits of the company to be ascertained by
reference to such proportion of the total profits and income

in any district where the defaulter resides or in which any
property, movable or immovable, owned by the defaulter is
situate, containing particulars of such tax and the name or
names of the person or persons by whom the tax is payable,

which such place is situate. The Magistrate shall thereupon
summon such defaulter before him to show cause why further
proceedings for the recovery of the tax should not be taken
against him, and in default of sufficient cause being shown

sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence
punishable with fine only or not punishable with
imprisonment, and the provisions of subsection (1) of section
291 (except paragraph (a), (d) and (i) thereof) of the Code of

the provisions of that subsection, he could have made at the
time of imposing such sentence.

by the Commissioner-General for the purposes of subsection
(1), shall not be called in question or examined by the
Magistrate in any proceeding under this section and
accordingly, nothing in that subsection shall be read and
construed as authorizing a Magistrate to consider, or decide
the correctness of any statement in such certificate or to
postpone or defer such proceeding for a period exceeding
thirty days, by reason only of the fact that an appeal is pending
against the assessment in respect of which the tax in default
is charged.

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, shall apply

made in instalments.

cause as therein provided, or under subsection (4) for the
payment of the fine; and the provisions of Chapter XXXIV

apply, where the defaulter is so required to give bail.

payment be made in instalments and default is made in the
payment of any one instalment, proceedings may be taken as
if default had been made in payment of all the instalments
then remaining unpaid.
(7) In any proceeding under subsection (1), the
Commissioner-General’s certificate shall be sufficient
evidence that the tax has been duly assessed and is in default,
and any plea that the tax is excessive, incorrect, or under
appeal, shall not be entertained.
