subsisting over all or any part of the property of the company,
a receiver may be appointed under this Part of this Act by
virtue of each such charge. A receiver appointed by or on the

receiver by this Act, to the exclusion of any other receiver.
(2) Where two or more floating charges rank equally with

(3) Subject to subsection (4), the powers of a receiver
appointed by or on the application of the holder of a floating
charge are suspended by, and as from the date of the

to such extent as may be necessary to enable the receiver
second mentioned, to exercise his powers under this Act. Any
powers so suspended shall take effect again when the prior
floating charge ceases to attach to the property subject to the
charge, or when the appointment of a receiver under the prior
floating charge ceases in respect of that property, whichever
occurs first.
(4) The suspension of the powers of a receiver under
subsection (3) does not have the effect of requiring him to
release any part of the property (including any letters or
documents) of the company from his control, until he receives
from the receiver superceding him a valid indemnity (subject
to the limit of the value of such part of the property as is
subject to the charge, by virtue of which he was appointed)
in respect of any expenses, charges and liabilities he may
have incurred in the performance of his functions as receiver.
