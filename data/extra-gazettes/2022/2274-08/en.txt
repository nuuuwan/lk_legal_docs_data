INdEPENdENT  AUdIToR’S  REP oRT

December 2021, and financial performance of the Institute and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with

2A
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Section of my 
report. I am independent of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA 
Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
Other Information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information  included  in the Annual 
Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report   thereon.
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, I conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and those who Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with  
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless Management either intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged  with 
governance are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. I also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud and error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to prove a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, or fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	 Obtaining an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Institute’s internal controls.

3A
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am 
required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
Other Matter
The Financial Statements of the institute for the year ended 31st December, 2020 were audited by another auditor who 
expressed an unmodified opinion on those financial Statements.
Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
I communicate with those who charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that, I identify during 
my audit.

1.3 Going Concern
 The Council of the Institute has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is     
satisfied that it has the resources to continue its operations in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the council 
is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast a significant doubt upon the ability of the Institute to 
continue as a going concern. The Council has assessed the existing and anticipated effects of COVID-19 on 
its operations and has taken all possible measures to mitigate the effects of COVID 19 and reduced the impact 
to its operations. While adhering to the health regulations issued by the government, the Institute was able to 
convert most of its activities such as Examinations, National conference, seminars/ workshops and other short 
courses to virtual/hybrid platforms to strengthen its ability to continue providing services to ensure operation 
is continued as least impacted as possible.
1.4 Financial Period
The financial period of the Institute represents a twelve - months period from 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021.
1.5 Accounting for Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL)
APFASL has been set up jointly with the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy (IPFDA) and The 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) in 2012, to enhance the capacity of public sector 
financial management professionals. Both CA Sri Lanka and IPFDA have equally contributed Rs. 10 mn as initial 
investment for this project. In terms of paragraph 5.9 of the Articles of Constitution of APFASL, on the occasion of 
dissolution, the fund will either be spent for collective welfare purpose or be granted towards any good cause as the 
general membership feels best.
The  assets  and liabilities of Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) which had 
been amalgamated with the Institute  financials up to  year 2015  have been de - recognised  from the financial

statements of the Institute from the year 2016 due to the amendment of certain clauses and provisions of the 
Constitution of APFASL in order to operate as a more autonomous entity.
1.6 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
1.6.1 Statement of Compliance
The financial statements of the Institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards issued 
by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
These financial statements comprise the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement 
of changes in funds and reserves, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements unless otherwise stated.
1.6.2 Basis of Measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost basis, except where appropriate 
disclosures are made with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
1.6.3 Comparative Information
Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of the 
previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements, in order to enhance the understanding of the 
financial statements of the current period and to improve comparability.
Where necessary, comparative figures have been rearranged to conform to the current year’s presentation.
1.6.4 Responsibility and Approval of Financial Statements
The Council of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka acknowledges their responsibility for the financial 
statements and financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Council at the meeting held on 
24th March 2022.
1.6.5 Materiality and Aggregation
Each material class of similar items is presented separately in the financial statements. Items of a dissimilar nature 
or function are presented separately, unless they are immaterial.
1.6.6 Functional and Presentation Currency
The financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Institute’s functional and presentation 
currency, in the primary economic environment in which the Institute operates.
All financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated 
otherwise.
1.7 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation and presentation of financial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, requires 
Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and 
judgements used.

12A
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows:-
a) Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) and Accounting for Association of Public 
Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL)
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all factors 
and circumstances in SLFRS 10- “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows:-
(a) power over the investee
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Accordingly, Management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to variable returns 
from its involvement with AAT or APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation.
b) Defined Benefit Plans
The cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. 
Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase and retirement 
age. Due to the long- term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
c) Estimating the Incremental Borrowing Rate
As the Institute cannot readily determine the interest rate implict in the lease, it uses its incremental borrowing 
rate (IBR) to measurethe lease liabilities. IBR is rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow similar 
facilities from a financial institution.
d) Changes in Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the 
financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
2.1 Assets and the Bases of Their Valuation
2.1.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
(a) Basis of Recognition and Measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset 
will flow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income as incurred. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable.
(b) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight-line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, in order 
to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Asset Category Useful Life
(Years)
Buildings 50
Furniture 5- 10
Plant and Machinery 5-10
Motor vehicles 10
Computers 5
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is 
classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identified and depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to  the statement of 
comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of the related asset.
(c) Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Institute recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-
use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less 
any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.

<!-- page 14 -->

I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2022'04'04
Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE  EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE  DEMOCRATIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC OF  SRI  LANKA - 04.04.2022
14A
 The estimated useful lives of right of use assets are as follows;
Asset Category Useful 
Life
(Years)
Right of use asset       5
Improvements to Right of use asset     5
Depreciation of improvement to right of use asset is calculated based on the remaining lease period.
At the commencement date of the lease the Institute recognises lease liability measured at the present value 
of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, the lease payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on 
an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Institute and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Institute exercising the option 
to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses 
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.  
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Institute uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The 
Institute uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Institute determines its incremental 
borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from the Institute's internal records. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease 
payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, 
a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from 
a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset.
(d) Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no  future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year, the asset is derecognised.
2.1.2 Library Books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years.
2.1.3  Capital Work-In-Progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital nature, directly 
incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-in- progress would be

15A
transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is available for use i.e. when it 
is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the Institute.
2.1.4 Intangible Assets
a. Computer Software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use. 
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five to ten (5-10) years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
1.  It is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
2.  Management intends to complete the software product and use it;
3.  there is an ability to use the software product;
4.  it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
5.  adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software 
product are available; and
6.  the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognized as intangible assets are amortised over  their  estimated useful lives,  which  do not exceed   ten
(10) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress until the software is 
ready for use.
b. Study Material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA qualifications 
are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new curriculum,  the investment 
attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably measured and it can be demonstrated 
that it will generate probable future economic benefits.
These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful life is reviewed at 
least at each financial reporting year end.
2.1.5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and 
slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the 
estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on weighted average cost. 
The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location 
and condition.
The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.
2.1.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such 
indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes an estimate of the 

<!-- page 16 -->

16A
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its  recoverable  amount,  the  asset  is  considered  impaired  and  is  written  down  to  its recoverable amount. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount rate 
that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot “exceed” the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.1.7 Financial Assets - Initial Recognition and Measurement
(a)    SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments
SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 on “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting 
for financial instruments: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting.
(b)    Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain significant financing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient, 
the Institute initially measures financial assets at their fair value plus transaction costs. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a significant financing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient 
are measured at the transaction price determined under SLFRS 15.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Institute’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages financial 
assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from 
collecting contractual cash flows or selling the financial assets or both.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial 
Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The financial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, fixed deposits held to 
collect contractual cash flows, government securities, repurchase agreements and cash and cash equivalents.
The Institute’s financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of both of the 
following conditions:
(a) The financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and

<!-- page 17 -->

I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2022'04'04
Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE  EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE  DEMOCRATIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC OF  SRI  LANKA - 04.04.2022
17A
(b) The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
Accordingly, financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method 
and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modified or impaired.
2.1.8  Derecognition of Financial Assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of an Institute of similar financial assets) 
is primarily derecognised when:
•		 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
•		 The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either
(a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
(b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset.
When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards  of   ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset,  nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Institute 
also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original 
carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Institute could be required to repay.
2.1.9  Impairment of Financial Assets
The Institute recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments measured at 
amortized cost.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the 
cash flows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. 
The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are 
integral to the contractual terms.
For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
2.1.10  Reclassification
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the Management intends to hold these instruments to collect the 
contractual cash flows upon completion of the SPPI test and evaluating the historical data. As of  01 st  January 2018, 
the Institute has elected the business model of hold to collect the contractual cash flows and measured the instruments 
at amortized cost.
Prior to 01
st January 2018 financial assets were classified as held to maturity and available for sale. In complying with 
SLFRS 9, financial assets are reclassified at amortised cost. Cumulative  balance  in AFS reserve is removed and is

18A
used to adjust the reclassified  amortised cost. EIR determined at initial recognition and gross carrying amount are 
not adjusted as a result of reclassification.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare circumstances 
when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such financial assets.
Consequent to the change in the business model, the Institute reclassifies all affected assets prospectively from the first 
day of the next reporting period (the reclassification date). Prior periods are not restated.
2.1.11 Financial Liabilities
All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss. The Institute does not have financial liabilities for the year ended 31
st December 2021.
2.1.12 Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, 
which has been prepared using the 'indirect method'.
2.2 Liabilities and Provisions
A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;  held primarily for the 
purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or there is no unconditional 
right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. The Institute 
classifies all other liabilities as   non-current.
2.2.1 Deferred Income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes are raised at the commencement of 
the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months. Deferred income is recognized in 
the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken place and the balance attributable to the 
remaining course period is recognized as a liability on the statement of financial position until income is recognized.
2.2.2. Provisions
A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the obligation and the 
obligation can be measured reliably.
2.2.3 Employee Benefits
(a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan - Gratuity
Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan. The defined 
benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. The present value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, using interest 
rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related liability. The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends 
on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions about discount 
rate, future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are 
subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Accordingly, the employee 
benefit liability is based on the actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2021. The Institute’s accounting policy 
for gratuity is to recognise actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of 
other  comprehensive income.

19A
(b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in 
line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognized as an expense in the statement of comprehensive 
income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross emoluments of the employees to Employees’ 
Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund  respectively.
2.2.4 Taxation
(a) Income Tax
The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017.
(b) Other Taxes
V AT has been paid in respect of rent received by the Institute, letting of movable or immovable property, being 
the only taxable activity carried on by the Institute. Since the Institute is not engaged in carrying on              a trade or a 
business, the Institute is not liable for Economic Service Charge or Nation Building Tax. Therefore, no provision 
has been made for any other taxes.
(c) Deferred Taxation
Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed against the 
liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable income. Deferred tax has not 
been provided in the financial statements.
2.2.5  Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates which 
approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets (including securities) and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange at that date. 
Non - monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated at the 
foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realized and unrealized exchange differences are reported in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
2.3   Accounting for the Receipt and Utilization of Funds, Grants and Reserves
The Institute received various grants for specific development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have been classified 
as unrestricted funds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
2.3.1    Unrestricted Funds
Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Council and funds that 
are designated for a specific purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives of the Institute. Allocations 
made by the Council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the statement of comprehensive income. 
Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted funds in terms of the relevant donor agreements or 
with the subsequent approval of the donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of  references.

and reinvestment decisions require the approval of the investment committee.
ii. Withdrawal Policy:
Withdrawals are not made other than at maturity. Any early withdrawal requires the approval of the investment 
committee.

2.3.4 Grants
2.3.4.1     Land Received as a Government Grant:
Government grants for non-monetary assets are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will 
be received and all attached conditions have been complied with.
The method adopted for accounting for Government grant is income approach, where the grant relating to non-

2.4.1     Income Recognition
(a)      Income
The sources of revenue of CA Sri Lanka is recognised as per SLFRS 15 on “Revenue from contracts with customers”. 
Accordingly, SLFRS 15 establishes five step model to account for revenue recognition at an amount that reflect the 
consideration where CA Sri Lanka expects to provide services to its stakeholders. The Institute has adopted SLFRS 
15 using the full retrospective method based on the assessment performed and decided that the impact is not material 
to the financial statements and therefore adjustment has not been made in the retained earnings opening balance of 
the statement of changes in funds and reserves.
In terms of SLFRS 15, Revenue is recognised upon satisfactory performance obligation is achieved. CA Sri 
Lanka expects that, the revenue recognition to occur over time where stakeholders (mainly students and members) 
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by CA Sri Lanka and when the Institute has an enforceable 
right to receive payment for performance completed. Otherwise, the revenue  of the Institute is recognised at point in time.
