Note 1:  All eﬀ orts shall be made to remove unpleasant odour as practicable as possible.
Note 2:  These limit values are based on the premise that for an outfall leading up to near-shore water with no dilution, for short 
sea outfalls 1:10 and for long sea outfalls 1: 100 respectively. In an event where the dilution factor for a respective category 
mentioned above is found to be less, the limit values given in the Lists shall be adjusted on a proportional basis so as to give 
rise to more stringent values.
Note 3:  The limit values given in the List shall be measured at the entrance of the outfall preferably at the pumping station or 
a manhole.
 
Note 4: In the case of application of this List, the design incorporating bathymetry, dilution based on actual meteorological 
and current data at the place of construction, construction details such as pipe details (length of the pipe), anchoring details 
and diﬀ user descriptions etc. shall be approved by the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department, the 
Marine Environment Protection Authority, and any other relevant authorities as the case may be, and the letter/s of  approval 
shall be submitted to the Authority along with the application for Environmental Protection Licence.
Note 5:  The Authority may decide the ﬁ nal discharge point for either near shore water, short sea out fall or long sea out fall as 
the case may be, on the basis of an environmental screening of the likely impacts.
Note 6:  In case of the tolerance  limits  of  radioactive  materials  exceeds, the standards stipulated by the Sri Lanka Atomic 
Energy Regulatory Council shall apply.

Note 1: The eﬄ  uent discharge on land shall only be allowed under the following conditions;
 ( a) The highest seasonal groundwater table usually envisaged during rainy season Shall be at least 0.5 meters below the 
existing ground surface.
 ( b) The natural slope of the existing ground surface shall not be steeper than 30 Percent (or 16.7 degrees).
Provided however, the discharge on ground, steeper than 30% could be allowed under the circumstances where measures are 
taken in order to curtail the run oﬀ  arising due to the said discharge.
In this context a report showing the methods by which the runoﬀ   be curtailed shall be submitted to the Authority and the 
approval for the proposed method shall be obtained.
A test report indicating the design inﬁ ltration rate done by a competent authority for the soil investigations shall be submitted 
to the Authority.
Note 2:  The in-situ inﬁ ltration rate of the land to which the eﬄ  uents be discharged shall be measured in accordance with the 
standard test method for inﬁ ltration rate of soils in the ﬁ eld using double- ring inﬁ ltrometers stipulated in ASTM D3385-09 or 
by a standard test method   followed at present.
 
Note 3:  In case if the soil layers are diﬀ erent, the number of in-situ tests to be carried out for the land to which the eﬄ  uents 
discharge is planned shall be decided as follows:-
 (i) For a land having an extent up to  0.1 hectare (1000 m
2) - 1 test
 (ii) For a land having an extent greater than 0.1 hectare (100 0 m2) - 2 tests 
  and up to 1.0 hectare (10,000m 2)
 (iii) For a land having an extent greater than 1.0 hectare (10 ,000 m2) - 3 tests
  and up to 5.0 hectare (50,000m 2)
 (iv) For a land having an extent greater than 5.0 hectare (50, 000 m2)  - 5 tests
Note 4:  Design inﬁ ltration rate will be obtained by getting the average inﬁ ltration rate from clause (3) and it will be multiplied 
by the factor of safety 1/3. This method of estimation of inﬁ  ltration rate will be recommended merely to account for the 
variation of soil strata in the land to which the eﬄ  uent be discharged.

Note 5:  A report encompassing method of delivery of eﬄ  uents to the land, method of irrigation over the land, number of hours 
of application, eﬄ  uent storage facilities, types of crops and any other details envisaged shall be forwarded to the Authority.
Note 6:  The Authority has the sole discretion to decide based on the reports submitted the applicable inﬁ ltration rate so that 
the project developer could adhere to the given inﬁ ltration rate in deciding the land requirement for disposal of eﬄ  uent for the 
purpose of agriculture.
Note 7:  In case of the tolerance  limits  of  radioactive  materials  exceeds, the standards stipulated by the Sri Lanka Atomic 
Energy Regulatory Council shall apply.

Note 2: These  limit  values  are  based  on  the  premise  that  for  either inland surface water or coastal water, as the case may 
be, the dilution factor may be at least 1:8. In an event where the dilution factor is found to  be less, the limit values in the List 
shall be adjusted on a proportional basis so as to give rise to more stringent limit values.
Note 3: The List V is a set of interim criteria applicable for a speci ﬁ c period of 3 years from the date of enactment of these 
regulations and thereafter the general standards given in either List IIA, List IIB, List IIIA or List IIIB, as the case may be, shall

Note 1:  Following conditions shall be met:
 • Discharge of highly viscous material shall be prohibited.
 • Sludge including Calcium Carbide shall not be discharged.
 • Substances producing inﬂ  ammable vapours shall be absent
 • Oil based substances shall not be discharged.

   For the purposes of this Schedule-
“Coastal water” means a body of surface water conﬁ ned in an area lying within a limit of 300 meters landwards of  
the mean high water line or surface water in a river, stream, lagoon or any other body of water connected to the sea 
either permanently or periodically, within to a limit of 2 km landwards measured perpendicular from the mean high 
water line;
“Coastal Zone” means that the area referred to in the Coast Conservation Act, No.57 of 1981;
“Dilution factor” means the ratio of the quantity of wastewater or eﬄ  uent that is discharged to the average quantity 
of diluting water available which accounts for both the eﬄ  uent discharged and the receiving water at the point of 
disposal;
“Ground water” means water that collects or ﬂ  ows beneath the Earth's surface, ﬁ  lling the porous spaces in soil, 
sediment, and rocks, which originates from rain and is the source of water for aquifers, springs, and wells; the upper 
surface of groundwater is reckoned to be the water table;
“Inland surface water” means any standing or ﬂ owing water on the surface of the land extending up to the boundary 
of the coastal water;
 
“Leachate” means liquid that seeps through solid waste  or other medium and has extracts of dissolved or suspended 
material from it.
“Long sea outfall” means a pipeline or a tunnel that discharges wastewater or eﬄ  uent from a prescribed activity and 
is laid underneath the marine water with a mechanism to achieve intended dilution in such a manner that there shall 
be a minimum dilution factor of 1:100 at a distance of 500 metres from the point of exit of the pipeline or tunnel;
“Marine water” means the water in the area bounded by the mean low water line and the outer limit of the territorial 
sea;
“Near-Shore water” means the water in the area bounded by the m ean low water line and a line drawn parallel to 
wave breaking with a depth of 2.0 metres from the mean sea level;

“Outfall leading up to the near-shore” means a pipeline or a tu nnel that discharges wastewater or eﬄ  uent from a 
prescribed activity and is laid underneath the marine water with no dilution expected at a distance of 1.0 metre from 
the point of exit of the pipeline or tunnel;
“Short sea outfall” means a pipeline or a tunnel that discharges wastewater or eﬄ  uent from a prescribed activity and 
is laid underneath the marine water with a mechanism to achieve intended dilution in such a manner that there shall 
be a minimum dilution factor of 1:10 at a distance of 10 metres from the point of exit of the pipeline or tunnel; and
“Surface Water” means any standing or ﬂ owing water on the surface of the land which includes inland surface water, 
coastal water and marine water excluding ground water.".
