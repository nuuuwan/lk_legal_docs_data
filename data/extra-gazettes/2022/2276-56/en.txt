  4. Findings and  Observations -
     A.  Alcom Heavy Metals (Pvt) Ltd; a Board of Investment approved establishment having it's Head of ﬁ ce 
           in Colombo and Factory at Dambulla where mineral sands are processed for export. Mineral sands 
    are obtained from Lanka Mineral Sands Corporation on tender. Processed Mineral Sand in the form of 
    rutile, zircon and / laminate are exported to China, India Japan, Italy, Etc.The Finished products are 
    directly dispatched, whereas sand in crude form brought to the factory for polishing  value addition and 
    export.
   B.  The establishment Commenced operations in 2003 and continued processing and exporting the ﬁ nished 
                products. They were in a monopoly situation and lately several others tendered, and in consequence faced 
     dif ﬁ culties in obtaining the tender for production and supply. The management decided to modernize 
     replacing with new machines Chinese ﬁ rm brought in Chinese Technicians for installation, which lasted 
     several months. With the installation of new machinery the production had increased substantially.
   C.  There were nearly 70 employees, performing different functions who were classi ﬁ ed under labour grade. 
     Health and Welfare facilities  were deplorable, as explained herein -
        (a) Inside the factory it was very hot and all employees  removed  their  shirts

      Special provisions - Removal of dust and fumes, protection from vibration, and prevention 
      from noise.
      Regulations have been made under the factories Ordinance, which explains the application 
      of legal provisions on detail, which the employer shall observe in good,
    D. It was in 2016 , The inter Company Employees Union was formed and took up with the management, 
     among other matters, the question of recognition of the union and salary increase of 
     Rs. 10,000 per month. Some of the issues had been resolved at discussions held at Labour of ﬁ ce, 
     Naula. Salary increase byRs.10,000.00 was refused by the management, starting that the enterprises 
     was facing losses due to competition in business and failure to obtain a tender  for supplies.
     Although enterprise commenced operations in 2003, there was no evidence of evidence of any salary 
     increase until 2013, From 2013 onwards increases were made in the following manner.
         2013 Rs. 2,000 - To Rs. 4,000.00 - P.M.
         2014 Rs. 1,400 - To Rs. 2,100.00 - P.M.
         2015 Rs. 2,000 - To Rs. 3,200.00 - P.M.
         2016 Rs. 2,500 -  P.M.
     With the rejection of salary demand  by management workers commenced a strike w. e. t. 16 Feb. 2018, 
      which lasted till 09th April, 2018. On 22nd Feb 2018.Management required all workers to report back 
     to work, followed with a letter of vacation of post in the event of failure. Accordingly some workers 
     reported for work, while some kept away.
        Several rounds of discussions were held under the Chairmanship of Commissioner General 
     of Labour, to reach out a settlement, but consistently management was not ﬂ exible in their stand. At the
     latter stage the trade union offered to come back, under certain condition, but management 
     maintained intransigent attitude and as an escape ground, requested reference to voluntary 
     arbitration, under sec. 3(D) of Industrial Dispute Act, Where the other party also should agree, but Trade 
     Union did not accept their request. 
    E. The Trade Union embarked on a legal strike, meaning a registered Trade Union entitled to commence a 
     strike to win their just demands. Sri Lanka ratified ILO Convention No. 87, concerning the 
     Freedom of Association and tha Protection of the Right to Organize and Convention No.98 concerning 
     the Right to Organize and  Collective Bargaining.
   Also, in terms of article 14 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,  1978, a 
 citizens is entitled to, inter alia, The freedom to form and join a Trade union.
In this instance, when the workers of this Trade Union commencing a strike on 16 th Feb, 2018 Just there after  those who 
failed to report as requested by management, were considered to have vacated their posts. This is a serious violation and a 
commission of unfair labour practice.
    F. Most important in this litigation rests on the demand concerning the salary increase  by Rs. 10,000.00 
per month. Management consistently declared that the establishment suffered severe losses during the particular year. It is 
possible since, the Chinese ﬁ rm was engaged in ﬁ xing new machinery and in consequence normal work got disrupted. To 
prove it's position, Management through the witness marked documents R 13 and R 14, which do not project the total ﬁ nancial  
position of the establishment. There needs absolute transparency.
   Cash Flow pro ﬁ t and loss account and the balance sheet, should have been, submitted in complete form. The 
balance sheet will display the ﬁ nancial standing, with the amount lying at various banks. value of machinery and ﬁ ttings, 
value of various assets as well as liabilities. This indicates ﬁ nancial indiscipline, That is the result of number of reasons, 
primarily the lack of accountability and oversight by it's management.

  5. Award.
    Having examined the evidence comprehensively. I ﬁ nd that the management had ﬁ rstly neglected to provide 
the basic health and welfare facilities to the workmen, for 15 years past thus making it a slave camp,
 
   Secondly, immediately after the strike, when discussions were proceeding,terminating the employment contract,  
violated the obligation enunciated in ILO Conventions No. 87 and 98, including the breach of provions in Article 14 of 
Constitution of Sri Lanka.
   Thirdly, surreptitiously suppressing the ﬁ nancial position of the establishment, which forms the core issue in 
determining the matter in dispute.
   I therefore require the respondent to pay compensation the amounts notes against the following persons :
