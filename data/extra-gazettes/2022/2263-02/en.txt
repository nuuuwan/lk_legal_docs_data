THE 2022 PROHIBITED LIST 
WORLD ANTI-DOPING CODE 
V ALID 01 JANUARY 2022
Introduction
The 
Prohibited List is a mandatory International Standard as part of the World Anti-Doping Program.
The List is updated annually following an extensive consultation process facilitated by WADA. The eﬀ ective date of the List 
is 01 January 2022.
The oﬃ  cial text of the Prohibited List shall be maintained by WADA and shall be published in English and French. In the event 
of any conﬂ ict between the English and French versions, the English version shall prevail.
Below are some terms used in this List of Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods.
Prohibited In-Competition
Subject to a diﬀ erent period having been approved by WADA for a given sport, the 
In - Competition period shall in principle be 
the period commencing just before midnight (at 11:59 p.m.) on the day before a Competition in which the Athlete is scheduled 
to participate until the end of the Competition and the Sample collection process.
Prohibited at all times
This means that the substance or method is prohibited In- and Out-of-Competition as deﬁ ned in the Code.
Speciﬁ ed and non-Speciﬁ ed
As per Article 4.2.2 of the World Anti-Doping Code, “for purposes of the application of Article 10, all Prohibited Substances 
shall be Speciﬁ ed Substances except as identiﬁ ed on the Prohibited List. No Prohibited Method shall be a Speciﬁ ed Method 
unless it is speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed as a Speciﬁ ed Method on the Prohibited List”. As per the comment to the article, “the Speciﬁ ed 
Substances and Methods identiﬁ ed in Article 4.2.2 should not in any way be considered less important or less dangerous than 
other doping substances or methods. Rather, they are simply sub stances and methods which are more likely to have been 
consumed or used by an Athlete for a purpose other than the enhancement of sport performance.”
Substances of Abuse
Pursuant to Article 4.2.3 of the Code, 
Substances of  Abuse are substances that are identiﬁ ed as such because they are frequently 
abused in society outside of the context of sport. The followin g are designated Substances of Abuse: cocaine, diamorphine 
(heroin), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/”ecstasy”), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
 S0 NON-APPROVED SUBSTANCES
PROHIBITED AT ALL TIMES (IN- AND OUT-OF-COMPETITION)
All prohibited substances in this class are Speciﬁ ed Substances.
Any pharmacological substance which is not addressed by any of the subsequent sections of the List and with no current 
approval by any governmental regulatory health authority for human therapeutic use (
e.g. drugs under pre- clinical or clinical 
development or discontinued, designer drugs, substances approved only for veterinary use) is prohibited at all times.
This class covers many diﬀ erent substances including but not limited to BPC – 157.
