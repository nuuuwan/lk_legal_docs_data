 Explanation: “zero metre setback”:
 Zero metre setback is mandatory in certain areas to help generate activities along certain corridors or nodes.  
The objective is to integrate commercial developments with pedestrian access within the road Right of way 
(ROw). It can allow for a variety of building typologies and arcade (covered walkway) developments (Figure 
1.11). For Colombo Port City Development Project, zero setback defines minimum 70% built-to-edge along the 
East Boulevard in Financial District, and minimum 50% built-to-edge along other Boulevards (Figure 1.12). The 
remaining facade can have setbacks for plaza and F&B areas. developments built-to-edge can allow for setback 
at the ground floor for arcade (covered walkway) developments;

metre setback along Boulevard (except for the East 
Boulevard). This percentage allows for a good building 
edge with necessary setback area allowing for some play 
with the building design, pedestrian entry, drop off 
canopy, landscape areas and outdoor refreshment areas.

Urban Design Control Plans (Regulations 63 to 72 both inclusive)
Building Setback
63.   The building setbacks on each side of the plot are defined in the building setback control plan (Figure 3.2). Setback 
area in some key plots is mandated to allow for public thoroughfare, helping create more pedestrian links through 
large plots. These public thoroughfares are indicated in the next at-grade pedestrian network plan. The basement 
setbacks are defined in the Land Use Regulations (Regulations 50 to 62).   
Active Edges  
 64.  Streets are designed to increase the safety and vibrancy of the place. Active edges help define the public space 
and the private space, and create visual connection between the street users and the people inside the buildings. 
By regulating the uses and activities on the ground floor, these streets will have users continuously resulting in 
active public realm. selected plots are to provide commercial facade along ground level (cannot have their backs 
or blank sides on this side) especially along the Boulevard, the pedestrian mall, public parks, waterfront open 
space and the marina (Figure 3.3). 
 
At-Grade Pedestrian Network  
65. (1) The overall at-grade pedestrian network consists of the pedestrian malls as the spine of the whole network, 
covered walkways (arcade) that provide all-weather protected pedestrian routes, through-block links that break 
down the scale and improve permeability of the blocks, public thoroughfares that allow part of the development 
to be open for public, and public plazas at important pedestrian nodes (Figure 3.4). 
(2)  Covered walkways (arcade) shall be minimum 3.6m wide with 3.0m clear width and 4.5m clear height. 
Tower Zone  
66.  Tower zone shall be applicable to key plots including mixed use and commercial plots in the Financial district, 
TOd parcels and plots in other districts where tower building will be strategically positioned. Tower zone sug-
gests the location of tower building, landmark tower, iconic building and TOD marker building to help define 
the skyline of the Colombo Port City (Figure 3.5). 
 
Overhead and Underground Pedestrian Links  
67.  (1) Overhead and underground pedestrian network (Figure 3.6) shall compliment to the at-grade pedestrian 
network. These additional connections help navigate through the blocks quickly and conveniently. For plots 
located next to LRT stations, the developments shall connect directly to the LRT concourse through an overhead 
pedestrian link.
(2)  In the case of Financial district, an alternative pedestrian network is proposed at basement level (Figure 
3.7). An underground pedestrian network connects all key plots within the Financial district. The devel-
oper is recommended to rent the space along the pedestrian link for commercial activities. These activities 
will advocate business, safety and direct connection between developments. The developer shall provide 
sunken Plazas to integrate the underground pedestrian network with the at grade pedestrian network.

101A
Vehicle Ingress/Egress   
68.  The vehicular access to plots is usually not taken from the Main Boulevards (Figure 3.8). The main elevation 
towards the Boulevard and public parks is mainly dedicated to pedestrian access.  The location of access points 
is to be determined by the developers and the control is indicated by a range where access points can be located. 
However, this is further subject to verification for conflict with utility services, street facilities such as bus stops, 
taxi bays and street lamps, and street furniture such as benches.
  
Basement Car Park Circulation
  
69.  (1) For plots located in Financial district, the developer shall provide basement car park circulation where 
basement car park spaces in these plots can be accessed from (Figure 3.9). 
(2)    Pedestrian walkways shall be provided as they are indicated in the Basement Car Park Circulation Plan 
(Figure 3.9). The pedestrian walkways shall be connected to the underground pedestrian network.
(3)  w idth of driveway and pedestrian walkways, length of additional left-turn short lane, location of access to 
parking area are indicated on Basement Car Park Circulation Plan.
Roofscape   
70.  (1)  The roof areas of the development shall be considered the “fifth” elevation and designed to be fully inte-
grated as part of the overall building form, massing and architectural treatment and articulated to contribute to 
the skyline profile of this part of the city.
(2)  All service areas, Mechanical and electrical (M&e) equipment, water tanks, roof-top equipment, etc., shall 
be fully located within and integrated into the overall building envelope and visually concealed from the 
top and on all sides. 
Public Spaces
  
71. Public spaces and Landscaping are to be provided within the development, as indicated in the Public spaces and 
Landscape Plan (Figure 3.10) and as described below: -
(a) Green Buffer Zones: 
 The planted green buffer to the frontage of the plot facing a road, from which there is vehicular access to 
the site, shall be a minimum of 3.0m.
(b) Perimeter Tree Planting:
 Boundary tree planting (minimum width 2.0m) in a building setback fronting and contiguous with the 
public realm shall be sufficient to clearly demarcate the plot boundary and allow unobstructed pedestrian 
access into the ground level arcades and access to the building.
(c) Public Thoroughfare:
 Public thoroughfare access is to be provided within the plot boundary. As the plot boundary will lie within 
an integrated public open space it shall be demarcated with a non-corrosive metal strip or similar and 
provided with clearly marked and referenced trig points for land survey confirmation of the plot boundary 
with the land registration records.

102A
(d) Public spaces:
 Public spaces with minimum area of 1,000m² each in the form of plazas are to be provided within the 
development. Public space provided shall have its frontage opened and un-obstructed to allow for easy 
pedestrian access and good visibility from the adjoining street / public open space.
  
Night Lighting Master Plan
  
72. (1) The Night Lighting Master Plan for the Financial district, along the Canal and Marina district, shall guide 
the lighting up of developments to achieve a unique, three-dimensional nightscape for the area (Figure 3.11). 
This Master Plan is realised incrementally as and when new buildings are developed and when existing buildings 
redevelop or undergo major refurbishment.
(2) All developments within the Master Plan boundary are required to provide night lighting in compliance 
with the requirements listed in this section. These are to help realise the vision for a congruous, harmonious 
and well-coordinated signature nightscape, for the day-to-day night lighting of buildings as well as during 
festivals and national events. The Guidelines provide a recommended framework for the lighting treatment 
of key building elements, including the covered walkways, building facades, sky gardens and building 
crowns. They also highlight practical issues, such as light trespass, light pollution, light fitting details, as 
well as energy efficiency and maintenance, which should be considered upfront at the design stage.
(3) The night lighting design should take cognizance of the lighting design of surrounding developments.
(4) The night lighting design under the Master Plan refers to the lighting up of the exterior of the building to 
highlight the design of the development, particularly the building crown, façade, main architectural features 
of the building, sky gardens and the pedestrian areas at street level, using permanent lighting fixtures.
(5) The light fixtures are encouraged to be designed and well-integrated with the overall design of the building 
and integrated into the building façade or within a building element, such as the roof feature or sun-shading 
devices. The entire lighting fixture shall be located and installed fully within the boundary of the development.
(6)   The night lighting design will be evaluated under the following categories: -
(a) Basic Night Lighting - defined as the daily elegant, tasteful and sensitive lighting up of the architecture 
of the building to complement the overall skyline of the city at night; and
(b) Special Night Lighting - defined as special night lighting to accompany a specific festival or event. 
Special Night Lighting installations are fittings which can be programmed to complement and con-
tribute to different festivals or events held in the area.
(7) As a guide, the daily night lighting shall be elegant, tasteful and sensitive to the architecture of the build-
ing and well-coordinated with the overall night time skyline. Animated night lighting sequences for daily 
lighting up of the building are discouraged.  Festival or event night lighting shall relate to and complement 
the theme of the festival or event. A separate detailed festival night lighting proposal shall be submitted 
for each event for the Commission’s evaluation and approval. Specific guidelines may be provided by 
the Commission or the appointed event organiser to ensure coordination of the festive night lighting of 
developments around the area.
(8) Building owners are required to minimally turn on the night lighting as per the guideline issued by the 
Commission.

103A
(9)  The night lighting design shall be sustainable and energy saving.
(10) All developments within the Financial district, along the canal and the Marina district (Figure 3.11), are 
required to provide night lighting under the Night Lighting Master Plan, in accordance with the prevailing 
guidelines.
(11) To ensure that the external building lighting installation is considered as an integral part of the design of 
the development, all night lighting proposals shall be submitted formally to the Commission for approval 
as part of the development Permit process.
(12) The Night Lighting design shall minimally focus on the-
(a)   Covered Walkways and Public Spaces at the ground floor;
(b)   Façades of the buildings visible from the surrounding roads and public spaces;
(c)   sky Gardens; and
(d)   Building Crown.
(13) The external night lighting shall be reflected in the proposal plans for the development for the Commission’s 
approval. A retention clause will be included as a condition in the development permit for the development 
to ensure that the night lighting is retained and operated.
(14) Any changes to the approved night lighting proposal for the development (e.g. change in lighting concept, 
type of lighting equipment, specifications of the lighting equipment), are required to be submitted to the 
Commission for evaluation and approval.
(15) If the external lighting fixtures are not installed and commissioned according to the approved plans, the 
Applicant or Building Owner will be required to revise the lighting installation to match the previously 
approved lighting design or provide reasons for the deviation for the Commission evaluation and approval.
(16) The night lighting fixtures are to be retained and maintained throughout the entire life of the building and 
shall not be removed without the prior approval of the Commission.
(17)   Night lighting of the building crowns help to create a unique, three- dimensional skyline   for the city. A 
strategic colour temperature plan recommends that low and mid-rise structures use lights of a lower colour 
temperature at their building crowns, while high-rise structures should use higher colour temperature lights, 
to create a colour gradation effect for the skyline
(18) There is a growing concern about the excessive use of lights to illuminate the cityscape. Night lighting 
shall thus be executed sensitively to avoid glare, light trespass and light pollution. Pedestrians, residents, 
drivers, and other fields of vision shall be considered to prevent light spillage and to increase the energy 
efficiency of the lighting.
(19) Sufficient measures shall be taken to ensure that night lighting fixtures and mounting details are fully inte-
grated with the architecture and/or landscape design of the building and screened from view.
(20) The night lighting equipment shall have necessary protective means from damage, theft and harm to the 
public, for those elements that are accessible to the public.
(21) Light sources that have a high energy-efficiency rating, have a long operating life for easier maintenance, 
and are of high economic efficiency, such as compact metal halide lamps, fluorescent lamps, LEDs, or 
electrodeless lamps, are recommended for use.

 sCHeDUle IV (regulations 43 & 50-62)
VeHICle PARkING sTANDARDs
1.   The Vehicle Parking Standards stipulate the minimum parking layout dimensions for cars, heavy vehicles and motorcycles 
parking places. All dimensions shall be met when designing a parking place. Where necessary, provision in excess of the 
requirement stated in these standards shall be made to meet the actual demand of the development.
2.0 Car Parking
2.1 Minimum Dimensions of Parking space
A parking space refers to the space for parking of one motorcar. The space shall be rectangular. The longer side is known 
as length and the shorter side is the width. In parallel parking, the longer side is parallel to the parking aisle or driveway.
The minimum dimensions required for a car parking stall are as follows (Figure A-1):-
(a) Stall width: 2.5m
(b) Stall length: 5.0m
(c) Stall length for parallel parking: 6.0m
The area of each stall shall be flat and free from kerbs and other encumbrances.
 
 Figure A-1 Minimum dimensions of car parking stalls     Figure A-2 Parking stalls with adjacent obstruction
Where there is an obstruction (any large element above 1.75m such as columns, walls or ducts) adjacent to a stall, located 
within the middle 2.8m of the parking length, the parking stall shall be widened. If the obstruction is on one side, the minimum 
stall width shall be 2.8m. If the obstruction is on both sides, the minimum stall width shall be 3.1m (Figure A-2).

        Figure A-3 Parking stalls cannot be parked by reversing                       Figure A-4 Increase width of perpendicular spaces
For parallel parking, where cars cannot be parked by reversing or where there are obstructions at its ends, minimum stall 
length shall be 7.2m (Figure A-3).
Dead-end aisles shall be avoided wherever possible, as manoeuvring and parking at those corner-ends would be difficult for 
drivers. Instead, the end space shall be widened to 2.8m to facilitate parking (Fig. A-4).
2.2 Car Park Allocation
For the following land uses, a minimum of 80% of vehicle parking spaces shall be in multi-storey and/or basement car parks:
• Low Rise Residential (R1), Medium Rise Residential (R2), Mixed Use 1, Mixed Use 2 (TOD Parcel), Mixed Use 
3 (CBD Parcel), Commercial, Marina Commercial, Hotel, Education, Public Facility, Marina Facility.
For the following land uses, a minimum of 50% of vehicle parking spaces shall be in multi-storey and/or basement car parks:
• Cultural and Healthcare, Leisure and Entertainment.
2.3 Minimum Width of Parking Aisle
A parking aisle refers to an access lane or driveway with adjacent parking stalls.
Parking angle is the angle measured between the longer side of the parking stall and the line of traffic flow of the aisle.
Traffic Flow refers to the direction of vehicle movement.
