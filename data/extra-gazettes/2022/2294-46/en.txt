 (a)  Non recognition of seniority
  Following 8 applicants had the highest marks, for seniority, and in accordance with the ePF registration 
numbers, seniority is as follows - 
 ePF No. 10210 - a. abdul Majeed
 ePF No. 11320 - s. a. Fernando 
 ePF No. 11389 - (Mrs.) P. hewage
 ePF No. 11548 - P. P. d. N. Karunaratne 
 ePF No. 11891 - M. a. s. Nishantha
 ePF No. 12155 - (Mrs.) t. g. C. swarnamali
 ePF No. 12386 - W. a. N. Wanniarachchi
 ePF No. 13678 - K. a. s. Piyasena 
  For executive positions of responsibility and authority mere were seniority alone would not be 
sufficient. It is justified in choosing a more efficient for promotion overlooking mere seniority and 
promotion is strictly a matter of internal management. 
 (b)  Manipulation of Interview marks. 
  applicants, P. P. d. N. Karunaratne grievance is that, he faced only one interview, but had different 
marks for the two posts. If it was the one and the same interview, there cannot be any variation, since 
for one he scored 12 and for the other 10.
  In respect of most applicants in respect of the two posts, variations existed as such No body has been 
discriminated and the allegation is baseless.

 a. abdul Majeed 06 08
 M. P. Chandana 08 10

 (c)  adaptation of new marking scheme, 
  All enterprises aim at improving efficiency and increased productivity. Therefore various steps and 
measures are taken towards that end. Maintenance of discipline and administration is the prerogative 
of the management. Once a scheme is designed and implemented management is required to adopt 
it faithfully and there shall not be any discrimination. 
  92% accepted the new marking scheme 
  i.e. 100 x 23 - 92%

 (d)  Non acceptance of Certificates of Competency.

   An ideal certificate should contain - 
 (a)  Name and address of the issuing authority;
 (b)  Name and designation of the person authorized to sign;
 (c)  Purpose or the event with dates. 
 (d)  Name of recipient; and 
 (e)  Certificate number
  Those ingredients are required for the purpose of verification. Forged  certificates are referred back 
to verify it's genuineness. Most institutes have no ''legal personality'', such as sports Clubs, Liter-
ary associations, Welfare associations etc. But maintain good name with proper accounts and lists 
of membership. however, clubs with a legal personality, where perpetual succession exists have 
recognition. absence of said vital information means, there is no evidential valve. 
5.  Award 
 I have examined the matter in dispute comprehensively and am satisfied that the respondents have not violated or 
discriminated the applicants in any form. The new marking system is designed very scientifically, so that the best person 
with extraordinary talent and shall, succeed, who could keep his head and shoulders above the rest. the applicants are 
not entitle to any relief. 
 this is just and a fair award.
