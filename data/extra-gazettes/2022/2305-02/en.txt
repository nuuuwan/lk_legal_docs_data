Schedule 2
Productivity Based Incentive Scheme (PBIS)
   1 .  BMPH Factor
 ( a) Target BMPH applicable for each ship will be determined per the table below and the berth plan will be made 
accordingly. Applicable Crane Intensity for planning purpose will be determined based on input received from 
the Central Planners of respective vessel operator. Yard stock as at the beginning of the shift during which 
the ship is expected to berth will be used. ETA and ETD of the ship will be determined using the applicable 
BMPH target and the berthing plan for the ship will be determin ed and communicated to the ship operator 
accordingly.

 ( b) Actural data in the Vessel Performance Report (VPR) generated  after the completion of the ship will be the 
ﬁ nal information used for PBIS purposes. If there is a variance in planned vs actual Cl, the ﬁ nal Cl as per the 
VPR will be used to determine the applicable BMPH target for the ship.
 ( c) BMPH achieved as per the Gross Ship Rate will be used for calculation purposes. (Labour On to Labour Oﬀ )
 ( d) Success rate will be determined based on the ﬁ nal achieved GSR as per the VPR over the Target BMPH planned.

   5 .  High Performance Factor. –
 a. Higher BMPH performance on each ship handled within each sh ift will be rewarded through this factor.
 b. Shift will become eligible for this factor only if the shif t handles a minimum of 33%  of total moves of the 
ship during  the shift and the overall success rate achieved for the speciﬁ c ship is more than 90%.
 c. Diﬀ  erence between the applicable rate for actual BMPH achieved for the ship as per VPR and the applicable 
rate for higher BMPH achieved by the shift will be determined.
 d. If a group handles the same ship  in more than I shift, the  average BMPH achieved over all shifts by the 
same group  will be used  for the calculation.
 e. Total HPF amount earned for ships handled by the group duri ng the month will be added to the PBIS.
 f. Sample calculation of the HPF is as follows.
   6 .  Consistent Performance Incentive. –
 a. Consistent Performance Incentive (CPI) will be paid quarter ly subject to following terms and conditions.
  i. Average BMPH success rate for each  month shall be over 90 %.
  ii. Not more than 10% of the ships handled shall be below 90%  of the BMPH success rate in each month.
 If  100 ships handled by a group in a particular month, Not mo re  than 10 ships  should be<90%.
  iii. Above shall be met for 3 consecutive months to be eligib le for the CPI.
 b. CPI amount for 100% success  rate shall be Rs. 12,500/-. It  will be adjusted  downwards/Upwards based on
