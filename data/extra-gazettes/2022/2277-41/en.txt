Ms.Pathberiya, Deputy Human Resource Manager in her evidence stated as follows. She said notice was issued on 
02.02.2017 for calling applications for the interview and 20 applications were received. Out of 20 only 5 were met the basic 
qualiﬁ cations and they called for the interview. Initially 2 were selected namely G.L.Dhammika and M.T.C. Ratnayake.
Balance 3 were selected after the recommendation of the committee headed by the Managing  Director.
 
She further said all 3 applicants who were security Supervisor B-3 grade was called for the interview.
But Post of Security Assistant was not considered as it was not a Supervisory Post. Team Leaders Training period was taken 
into consideration but was not sufﬁ cient. 
Non of the Applicants had 8 years experience. 
Both parties have ﬁ led written submissions .
Applicants in their written submissions stated as follows.
The Respondent has violated fundamental rights of the Applicants by stating criteria for the application were B3 and C1 
grade could for B1 grade ( page 26 of evidence) Whereas when considering promotion to Bl grade Applicants should be 
from B2 Grade. If there are no B2 Grade Applicants , B3 grade Applicants should be considered.
Applicants further stated the Respondent main witness Deputy H.R. Manager has given marks to 5 applicants prior to the 
interview in order for them to reach 40 marks level. Whereas interview board has given not more than 15 marks.
The Respondent in their submission stated that the Applicants were selected without any injustice. Selection Criteria was
1. B 3 or Cl
2. G.C.E A/L 2 passes including 3 years experience in supervisory grade in 8 years experience.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to following conclusions.
The Respondent has acted maliciously towards the applicants as the B2 Grade was not considered to be promoted to B l 
grade in the selection Criteria. The Respondent has acted maliciously towards the Applicants as the selection Criteria was 
predesigned to suit the persons who were called for the interview. ( eg. Selection Criteria was B 3 or Cl instead of B I Grade.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe (1991) 
that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable; he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the 
contract o employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect of the award 
is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator creates a new 
contract for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract. An industrial 
arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force in the future when he cannot get the 
parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my ﬁ nding that the Respondent Company (party of the second part) has caused injustice to 
the applicant.( party of the First part ).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the First part
(the Applicants).
(a) Be promoted to Bl grade with effect from 01.07.2017.
(b) Be paid any loss of salary , and allowances (Less Over Time) which were entitled to the 7 Applicants for the above period 
as follows.
