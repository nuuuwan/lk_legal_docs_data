 III. Sri Lanka Transport Board, has acted unfairly and malicio usly towards the applicant by denying him the 
salary due for Grade 6 to up to now.
 IV . The Applicant stated total Salary Loss for him up to 20.06 .2020 is Rs. 44,030/- In the circumstances, I 
wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe (1991) that the 
arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of 
the contract of employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The 
eﬀ ect of the award is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that 
as industrial arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and 
liabilities arising out an existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions 
of employment to come into force in the future when he cannot g et the parties to agree to them in contrast 
to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties. 
For the reasons aforesaid it is my ﬁ nding that the Respondent Company (party of the second part) has caused injustice 
to the applicant. (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of 
the First part be paid loss of Salary Rs. 22,015/- (half of tot al salary loss claimed Rs. 44,040/-) due to the Party of 
the First Part for the said period.
The said sum of Rs. 22,015/- be deposited at the oﬃ  ce of Commissioner of Labour, Colombo East within 14 days 
of this award.
I further make order that this award should be implemented with in 21 days of the publicaion in the Government 
Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award just and equitable.
