   Bank's contribution .. 12% (twelve per cent) of salary
   Employee's contribution  .. 8% (eight per cent) of salary)
 
   Provident Fund contributions shall be on the consolidated salary referred to at Clause 5 hereof subject to 
the Rules of the Provident Fund.
 (b) Interest on Provident Fund Contributions held by Bank
   Where Provident Fund monies are invested in the Bank, the Ba nk shall continue to pay the rate of interest 
paid on 12 months' ﬁ xed deposits for a sum of Rs 100,000/- published by the N.S.B. or HNB which ever

July for the second half of the year on the net Provident Fund monies invested at the Bank.
 (c) De ﬁ ciency in Bank's Contributions to Provident Fund to an Employee not entitled to a Pension
   Where an employee shall cease to be employed by the Bank in circumstances which do not entitle him to a 
pension or payment in lieu of pension as the case may be, such employee shall be entitled to the diﬀ erence 
between the Bank's contributions made to the Fund during his period of service and the employer's minimum 
rate of contribution he would have been entitled to, in terms of the Employees' Provident Fund Act and its 
amendments from time to time as a contribution to the Fund by the employer on behalf of such employee. 
Such deﬁ ciency will be the diﬀ erence between the following minimum rates of contribution under the Act 
and 10% of basic salary actually contributed by the Banks up to 31st March 1992.
    From 1.1.71 to 31.12.80 .. 9% of consolidated salary
   From 1.1.81 onwards .. 12% of consolidated salary
 
   Prior to 31.12.70 the employer's minimum rate of contributio n was 6% of total earnings (gross salary) 
which was less than 10% of basic salary and therefore no deﬁ ciency arises.
