 1. Introduction
  the State Ministry of Solar wind and Hydro Power development jointly with the Sri lanka Sustainable energy 
Authority is paving the way forward to achieve the high target of contributing 70% of renewable energy out of the 
national energy requirement in 2030 in line with the “Sawbagye Dakma”manifesto of His excellency the President.
  in order to achieve this target, number of programs have been implemented to develop renewable energy resources 
by the Authority with the powers vested in it as per the provisions of the Sri lanka Sustainable energy Authority Act 
no. 35 of 2007 and on the instructions received from the State Ministry.
  the primary objective of this is to introduce a speedy activity plan to sign the power purchase agreements under a

  it is expected to proceed with following actions under the acceleration program.
 i. intervention of the Sri lanka Sustainable energy Authority to obtain the approvals required form other agencies 
in a speedy manner.
 ii. Providing the support in Ministerial level to resolve the issues in power project development.
 iii. identifying the non-progressive projects and take steps to develop such projects.

 4.1  Publication of the Grid Capacity availability by the Ceylon Electricity Board :
  if the ceylon electricity board had published the Grid capacity availability within past 06 months in one or few 
Grid Substations, the Sustainable energy Authority shall be informed and request the ceylon electricity board 
to allocate such availability to the applicant who have already registered to such grid substation. 
4.1.1 A reply shall be obtained within 14 days from the date of such notice.
