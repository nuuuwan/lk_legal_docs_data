Introduction 
Scope of this SLSRS 
1. This Sri Lanka Standard on Related Services (SLSRS) deals with:  
(a) The practitioner‚Äôs responsibilities when engaged to perform an agreed-upon procedures engagement; 
and 
(b) The form and content of the agreed-upon procedures report. 
2. This SLSRS applies to the performance of agreed-upon procedures  engagements on financial or non-
financial subject matters. (Ref: Para. A1‚ÄìA2) 
 
Relationship with SLSQC 11 
3. Quality control systems, policies  and procedures are the respon sibility of the firm. SLSQC 1 applies to 
firms of professional accountants in respect of a firm‚Äôs agreed -upon procedures engagements. The 
provisions of this SLSRS regarding quality control at the level  of individual agreed-upon procedures 
engagements are premised on the basis that the firm is subject to SLSQC 1 or requirements that are at 
least as demanding. (Ref: Para. A3‚ÄìA8) 
The Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement 
4. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner performs the procedures that have been agreed 
upon by the practitioner and the engaging party,  w h e re the engaging party has acknowledged that the 
procedures performed are appropriate for the purpose of the engagement. The practitioner communicates 
the agreed-upon procedures performed and the related findings in the agreed-upon procedures report. The 
engaging party and other intended users consider for themselves the agreed-upon procedures and findings 
reported by the practitioner and draw their own conclusions from the work performed by the practitioner. 
 
5. The value of an agreed-upon procedures engagement performed in accordance with this SLSRS results 
from: 
(a) The practitioner‚Äôs compliance with professional standards, incl uding relevant ethical requirements; 
and  
(b) Clear communication of the procedures performed and the related findings. 
6. An agreed-upon procedures enga gement is not an audit, review  or other assurance engagement. An 
agreed-upon procedures engagement does not involve obtaining ev idence for the purpose of the 
practitioner expressing an opinion or an assurance conclusion in any form. 
Authority of this SLSRS 
7. This SLSRS contains the objectives of the practitioner in following the SLSRS, which provide the context 
in which the requirements of this SLSRS are set. The objectives  are intended to assist the practitioner in 
understanding what needs to be accomplished in an agreed-upon procedures engagement. 
8. This SLSRS contains requirements, expressed using ‚Äúshall,‚Äù that  are designed to enable the practitioner 
to meet the stated objectives. 
9. In addition, this SLSRS contains introductory material, definitions, and application and other explanatory 
material, that provide context relevant to a proper understanding of this SLSRS.

Relationship with SLSQC 1 (Ref: Para. 3) 
A3. SLSQC 1 deals with the firm‚Äôs responsibilities to establish and  maintain its system of quality control for 
related services engagements, including agreed-upon procedures engagements. Those responsibilities are 
directed at establishing:  
x The firm‚Äôs quality control system; and 
x The firm‚Äôs related policies designed to achieve the objective o f the quality control system and its 
procedures to implement and monitor compliance with those policies. 
A4. Under SLSQC 1, the firm has an obligation to establish and maintain a system of quality control to provide 
it with reasonable assurance that:  
(a) The firm and its personnel comply with professional standards a nd applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements; and 
(b) Reports issued by the firm or engagement partners are appropriate in the circumstances.2 
A5. A jurisdiction that has not adopted SLSQC 1 in relation to agreed-upon procedures engagements may set 
out requirements for quality control in firms performing such engagements. The provisions of this SLSRS 
regarding quality control at the engagement level are premised on the basis that quality control 
requirements adopted are at leas t as demanding as those of SLSQ C 1. This is achieved when those 
requirements impose obligations on the firm to achieve the aims  of the requirements of SLSQC 1, 
including an obligation to establish a system of quality contro l that includes policies and procedures that 
address each of the following elements:  
x Leadership responsibilities for quality within the firm; 
x Relevant ethical requirements; 
x Acceptance and continuance of client relationships and specific engagements; 
x Human resources; 
x Engagement performance; and 
x Monitoring. 
 
A6. Within the context of the firm‚Äôs system of quality control, eng agement teams have a responsibility to 
implement quality control procedures applicable to the engagement.  
 
A7. Unless information provided by the firm or other parties su ggests otherwise, the engagement team is 
entitled to rely on the firm‚Äôs system of quality control. For e xample, the engagement team may rely on 
the firm‚Äôs system of quality control in relation to: 
x Competence of personnel through their recruitment and formal training. 
x Maintenance of client relationships through acceptance and continuance systems. 
x Adherence to legal and regulatory requirements through the monitoring process. 
In considering deficiencies identified in the firm‚Äôs system of quality control that may affect the agreed -
upon procedures engagement, the engagement partner may consider measures taken by the firm to rectify 
the situation that the engagement partner considers are suffici ent in the context of that agreed-upon 
procedures engagement.

A8. A deficiency in the firm‚Äôs system of quality control does not necessarily indicate that an agreed -upon 
procedures engagement was not performed in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements, or that the agreed-upon procedures report was not appropriate. 
 
Effective Date (Ref: Para. 11) 
A9. For terms of engagement coverin g multiple years, practitioners may wish to update the terms of 
engagement so that the agreed-upon procedures engagements will be conducted in accordance with this 
SLSRS on or after the effective date.  
Definitions 
Engaging Party and Other Intended Users (Ref: Para. 13(a), 13(b), 13(d), 13(g), 24(f)(i), 24(g), 30(e)(i), 
30(e)(iii)) 
A10. In some circumstances, the procedures may be agreed with intend ed users in addition to the engaging 
party. Intended users other than the engaging party may also ac knowledge the appropriateness of the 
procedures.  
A11. The engaging party may be, under different circumstances, the r esponsible party, a regulator or other 
intended user. References to the engaging party in this SLSRS i nclude multiple engaging parties when 
relevant.  
Findings (Ref: Para. 13(f)) 
A12. Findings are capable of being objectively verified, which means that different practitioners performing 
the same procedures are expected to arrive at equivalent result s. Findings exclude the expression of an 
opinion or a conclusion as well as any recommendations that the practitioner may make.  
A13. Practitioners may use the term ‚Äúfactual findings‚Äù in place of ‚Äúfindings‚Äù, for example, in cases when the 
practitioner is concerned that the term ‚Äúfindings‚Äù may be misun derstood. This may be the case in 
jurisdictions or languages where the term ‚Äúfindings‚Äù may be understood as including results that are not 
factual.  
Relevant Ethical Requirements (Ref: Para. 17) 
Objectivity and Independence  
A14. A practitioner performing an agreed-upon procedures engagement is required to comply with relevant 
ethical requirements. Relevant ethical requirements ordinarily comprise CA Sri Lanka Code, together 
with national requirements that are more restrictive. CA Sri Lanka Code requires practitioners to comply 
with fundamental principles including objectivity, which requires practitioners not to compromise their 
professional or business judgment because of bias, conflict of interest or the undue influence of others. 
Accordingly, relevant ethical requirements to which the practit ioner is subject would, at a minimum, 
require the practitioner to be objective when performing an agreed-upon procedures engagement.  
A15. CA Sri Lanka Code does not contain independence requirements fo r agreed-upon procedures 
engagements. However, national ethical codes, laws or regulations, other professional requirements, or 
conditions of a contract, program, or arrangement relating to t he subject matter for the agreed-upon 
procedures engagement may specify requirements pertaining to independence.

Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations3 
A16. Law, regulation or relevant ethical requirements may:  
(a) Require the practitioner to report identified or suspected non-compliance with laws and 
regulations to an appropriate authority outside the entity.  
(b) Establish responsibilities und er which reporting to an appropriate authority outside the entity may 
be appropriate in the circumstances.4  
 
A17. Reporting identified or suspected non-compliance with laws  and regulations to an appropriate authority 
outside the entity may be required or appropriate in the circumstances because: 
(a) Law, regulation or relevant ethical requirements require th e practitioner to report; 
(b) The practitioner has determined reporting is an appropriate  action to respond to identified or 
suspected non-compliance in accordance with relevant ethical requirements; or 
(c) Law, regulation or relevant ethical requirements provide th e practitioner with the right to do so. 
 
A18. The practitioner is not expected to have a level of unders tanding of laws and regulations beyond that 
necessary to be able to perform the agreed-upon procedures enga gement. However, law, regulation or 
relevant ethical requirements may expect the practitioner to ap ply knowledge, professional judgment 
and expertise in responding to identified or suspected non-compliance. Whether an act constitutes actual 
non-compliance is ultimately a matter to be determined by a cou rt or other appropriate adjudicative 
body.  
A19. In some circumstances, the reporting of identified or susp ected non-compliance with laws and 
regulations to an appropriate authority outside the entity may be precluded by the practitioner‚Äôs duty of 
confidentiality under law, regulation or relevant ethical requirements. In other cases, reporting identified 
or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate authority outside  the entity would not be considered a 
breach of the duty of confidentiality under the relevant ethical requirements.5  
A20. The practitioner may consider consulting internally (e.g.,  within the firm or network firm), obtaining 
legal advice to understand the professional or legal implicatio ns of taking any particular course of 
action, or consulting on a confidential basis with a regulator or a professional body (unless doing so is 
prohibited by law or regulations or would breach the duty of confidentiality).6 
Professional Judgment (Ref: Para. 18) 
A21. Professional judgment is exercised in applying the requirements  of this SLSRS and relevant ethical 
requirements, and in making informed decisions about courses of  action throughout the agreed-upon 
procedures engagement, as appropriate. 
A22. In accepting, conducting and reporting on an agreed-upon proced ures engagement, professional 
judgment is exercised, for example, in:  
                                                           
3 Relevant ethical requirements may indicate that non-compliance with laws and regulations includes fraud.

Accepting the engagement 
x Discussing and agreeing with the engaging party (and if relevan t, other parties) the nature, timing 
and extent of the procedures to be performed (taking into account the purpose of the engagement).  
x Determining whether engagement acceptance and continuance conditions have been met. 
x Determining the resources necessary to carry out the procedures  as agreed in the terms of the 
engagement, including the need to involve a practitioner‚Äôs expert.  
x Determining appropriate actions if the practitioner becomes awa re of facts or circumstances 
suggesting that the procedures to which the practitioner is bei ng asked to agree are inappropriate 
for the purpose of the agreed-upon procedures engagement. 
Conducting the engagement 
x Determining appropriate actions or responses if, when performing the agreed-upon procedures, the 
practitioner becomes aware of: 
o Matters that may indicate fraud or an instance of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance 
with laws or regulations. 
o Other matters that cast doubt on the integrity of the informati on relevant to the agreed-upon 
procedures engagement or that indicate that the information may be misleading. 
o Procedures that cannot be performed as agreed. 
Reporting on the engagement 
x Describing the findings in an objective manner and in sufficient detail, including when exceptions 
are found. 
A23. In conducting the agreed-upon procedures engagement, the need f or the practitioner to exercise 
professional judgment when performing the agreed-upon procedures is limited for reasons including:  
x An agreed-upon procedures engagement involves the performance o f procedures that have been 
agreed upon by the practitioner and the engaging party, where the engaging party has acknowledged 
that the procedures performed are appropriate for the purpose of the engagement. 
x The agreed-upon procedures and the findings that result from pe rforming those procedures are 
capable of being described objectively, in terms that are clear , not misleading, and not subject to 
varying interpretations.  
x The findings are capable of being objectively verified, which m eans that different practitioners 
performing the same procedures are expected to arrive at equivalent results. 
 
Engagement Level Quality Control (Ref: Para. 19‚Äì20) 
A24. The actions of the engagement partner and appropriate messages to the other members of the 
engagement team, in taking responsibility for the overall quali ty on each engagement, emphasize the 
importance to achieving the quality of the engagement of: 
(a) Performing work that complies with professional standards and regulatory and legal requirements; 
(b) Complying with the firm‚Äôs quality control policies and procedures as applicable; and 
(c) Issuing the practitioner‚Äôs report for the engagement in accordance with this SLSRS.

A25. SLSQC 1 requires the firm to obtain such information as it cons iders necessary in the circumstances 
before accepting an engagement with a new client, when deciding  whether to continue an existing 
engagement, and when considering acceptance of a new engagement  with an existing client. 
Information that assists the engagement partner in determining whether acceptance or continuance of 
client relationships and agreed-upon procedures engagements is appropriate may include information 
concerning the integrity of the principal owners, key managemen t and those charged with governance. 
If the engagement partner has cause to doubt management‚Äôs integ rity to a degree that is likely to affect 
proper performance of the engagement, it may not be appropriate to accept the engagement. 
A26. SLSQC 1 sets out the responsibilities of the firm for establish ing policies and procedures designed to 
provide it with reasonable assurance that the firm and its pers onnel comply with relevant ethical 
requirements. This SLSRS sets out the engagement partner‚Äôs resp onsibilities with respect to the 
engagement team‚Äôs compliance with relevant ethical requirements. 
A27. If the practitioner is unable to meet the requirement in p aragraph 20, it may be appropriate for the 
practitioner to agree with the engaging party to limit the scope of the agreed-upon procedures 
engagement to procedures for which the practitioner can appropriately take responsibility. The 
engaging party may separately engage an expert to perform the other procedures. 
 
Engagement Acceptance and Continuance (Ref: Para. 21‚Äì23) 
A28. In obtaining an understanding of the purpose of the agreed-upon  procedures engagement, the 
practitioner may become aware of indications that the procedure s the practitioner is asked to perform 
are inappropriate for the purpose of the agreed-upon procedures  engagement. For example, the 
practitioner may be aware of facts or circumstances that indicate: 
x The procedures are selected in a manner intended to bias the intended users‚Äô decision-making. 
x The subject matter on which the agreed-upon procedures are performed is unreliable. 
x An assurance engagement or advisory service may better serve th e needs of the engaging party or 
other intended users.  
A29.  Other actions that may satisfy the practitioner that the condit ions in paragraphs 21 and 22 are met 
include:  
x Comparing the procedures to be performed with written requirements set out, for example, in law or 
regulation, or in a contractual agreement (sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúTerms of Reference‚Äù), where 
appropriate. 
x Requesting the engaging party to: 
o Distribute a copy of the anticipated procedures and the form an d content of the agreed-upon 
procedures report as set out in the terms of engagement to the intended user(s). 
o Obtain acknowledgement from the intended user(s) of the procedures to be performed. 
o Discuss the procedures to be performed with appropriate representatives of the intended user(s). 
x Reading correspondence between the engaging party and other intended user(s) if the engaging party 
is not the only intended user.  
A30. If the conditions in paragraphs 21 and 22 are not met, it is un likely that an agreed-upon procedures 
engagement is able to meet the needs of the engaging party or o ther intended users. In such 
circumstances, the practitioner may suggest other services, such as an assurance engagement, that may 
be more appropriate.  
A31. All the conditions in paragraphs 21 and 22 also apply to proced ures that have been added or modified 
during the course of the engagement.

Descriptions of Agreed-Upon Procedures and Findings (Ref: Para. 22(c)) 
A32. The procedures to be performed during the agreed-upon procedure s engagement may be prescribed by 
law or regulation. In some circumstances, law or regulation may also prescribe the way the procedures 
or findings are to be described in the agreed-upon procedures r eport. As set out in paragraph 22(c), a 
condition of accepting an agreed-upon procedures engagement is that the practitioner has determined 
that the agreed-upon procedures an d findings can be described o bjectively, in terms that are clear, not 
misleading, and not subject to varying interpretations. 
A33. Agreed-upon procedures are described objectively, in terms that  are clear, not misleading, and not 
subject to varying interpretations. This means that they are de scribed at a level of specificity sufficient 
for an intended user to understand the nature and extent and if applicable, the timing, of the procedures 
performed. It is important to recognize that any term could pot entially be used in an unclear or 
misleading manner, depending on context or the absence thereof.  Assuming that the terms are 
appropriate in the context in which they are used, examples of descriptions of actions that may be 
acceptable include: 
x Confirm. 
x Compare. 
x Agree. 
x Trace. 
x Inspect. 
x Inquire. 
x Recalculate. 
x Observe. 
A34. Terms that may be unclear, misleading, or subject to varying in terpretations depending on the context 
in which they are used, may include, for example:  
x Terms that are associated with assurance under the Sri Lanka Auditing Standards such as ‚Äúpresent 
fairly‚Äù or ‚Äútrue and fair,‚Äù ‚Äúaudit,‚Äù ‚Äúreview,‚Äù ‚Äúassurance,‚Äù ‚Äúopinion,‚Äù or ‚Äúconclusion.‚Äù 
x Terms that imply expression of an assurance opinion or conclusi on such as ‚Äúwe certify,‚Äù ‚Äúwe 
verify,‚Äù ‚Äúwe have ascertained‚Äù or ‚Äúwe have ensured‚Äù with regard to the findings.  
x Unclear or vague phrases such as ‚Äúwe obtained all the explanations and performed such procedures 
as we considered necessary.‚Äù 
x Terms that are subject to varying interpretations such as ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù or ‚Äúsignificant.‚Äù 
x Imprecise descriptions of procedures such as ‚Äúdiscuss,‚Äù ‚Äúevaluate,‚Äù ‚Äútest,‚Äù ‚Äúanalyze‚Äù or ‚Äúexamine‚Äù 
without specifying the nature and extent, and if applicable, th e timing, of the procedures to be 
performed. For example, using the word ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù may be imprecise without specifying with whom 
the discussion is held or the specific questions asked. 
x Terms that suggest that the findings do not reflect factual res ults such as ‚Äúin our view,‚Äù ‚Äúfrom our 
perspective‚Äù or ‚Äúwe take the position that.‚Äù  
A35. For example, a procedure such as ‚Äúreview cost allocations to de termine if they are reasonable‚Äù is 
unlikely to meet the condition for terms to be clear, not misle ading, or not subject to varying 
interpretations because: 

<!-- page 18 -->

 PART I  : SEC.(1) ‚Äì GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 19.08.2022  
 
x The term ‚Äúreview‚Äù may be misinterpreted by some users to mean t hat the cost allocation was the 
subject of a limited assurance engagement even though no such a ssurance is intended by the 
procedure.  
x The term ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù is subject to varying interpretations as to what constitutes ‚Äúreasonable.‚Äù 
A36. In circumstances when law or regulation specifies a procedure or describes a procedure using terms that 
are unclear, misleading, or subject to varying interpretations, the practitioner may satisfy the condition 
in paragraph 22(c) by, for example, requesting the engaging party to: 
x Modify the procedure or the description of the procedure so that it is no longer unclear, misleading, 
or subject to varying interpretations. 
x If a term that is unclear, misleading or subject to varying int erpretations cannot be amended, for 
example because of law or regulation, include a definition of t he term in the agreed-upon 
procedures report. 
Compliance with Independence Requirements (Ref: Para. 22(e), 24(e)) 
A37. Paragraph 22(e) applies whe n the practitioner is required to comply with independence requirements 
for reasons such as those set ou t in paragraph A15. Paragraph 2 2(e) also applies when the practitioner 
agrees with the engaging party, in the terms of engagement, to comply with independence requirements. 
For example, the practitioner may have initially determined tha t the practitioner is not required by 
relevant ethical requirements, law or regulation, or other reas ons to comply with independence 
requirements. However, when considering engagement acceptance a nd continuance or agreeing the 
terms of engagement, the practitioner‚Äôs knowledge of the follow ing matters may indicate that a 
discussion with the engaging party as to whether compliance wit h certain identified independence 
requirements is appropriate for the purpose of the agreed-upon procedures engagement: 
x The purpose of the agreed-upon procedures engagement; 
x The identity of the engaging party, other intended users and responsible party (if different from the 
engaging party); 
x The nature, timing and extent of the procedures to be performed; or 
x Other engagements that the practitioner is performing or has pe rformed for the engaging party, 
other intended users or the responsible party (if different from the engaging party). 
A38. The practitioner may be the auditor of the financial statements  of the engaging party (or responsible 
party if different from the engaging party). In such a circumstance, if the practitioner is also engaged to 
conduct an agreed-upon procedures engagement, intended users of  the agreed-upon procedures report 
may assume that the practitioner is independent for the purpose  of the agreed-upon procedures 
engagement. Therefore, the practitioner may agree with the enga ging party that the practitioner‚Äôs 
compliance with the independence requirements applicable to aud its of financial statements is 
appropriate for the purpose of the agreed-upon procedures engagement. In such a case, a statement that 
the practitioner is required to comply with such independence r equirements is included in the terms of 
the engagement, in accordance with paragraph 24(e). 
 
Agreeing the Terms of the Engagement (Ref: Para. 24‚Äì25) 
A39. When relevant, additional matters may be included in the engagement letter, for example:  
x Arrangements concerning the involvement of a practitioner‚Äôs exp ert in some aspects of the agreed-
upon procedures engagement. 
x Any restrictions on the use or distribution of the agreed-upon procedures report.

 PART I  : SEC.(1) ‚Äì GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 19.08.2022  
 
 
A40. An illustrative engagement letter for an agreed-upon procedures engagement is set out in Appendix 1.  
A41. The practitioner may agree with the engaging party that the pro cedures to be performed will include 
quantitative thresholds for determining exceptions. If so, thes e quantitative thresholds are included in 
the descriptions of the procedures in the terms of the engagement.  
A42. In some circumstances, law or regulation may prescribe only the  nature of the procedures to be 
performed. In such circumstances, in accordance with paragraph 24(i), the practitioner agrees the timing 
and extent of procedures to be performed with the engaging party so that the engaging party has a basis 
to acknowledge that the procedures to be performed are appropriate for the purpose of the engagement.  
A43. In some circumstances, agreeing the terms of engagement and per forming the agreed-upon procedures 
takes place in a linear and discrete manner. In other circumsta nces, agreeing the terms of engagement 
and performing the agreed-upon procedures is an iterative proce ss, with changes to the agreed-upon 
procedures being agreed as the engagement progresses in response to new information coming to light. 
If procedures that have been previously agreed upon need to be modified, paragraph 25 requires the 
practitioner to agree the amended terms of engagement with the engaging party. The amended terms of 
engagement may, for example, take the form of an updated engage ment letter, an addendum to an 
existing engagement letter, or other form of written acknowledgement.  
 
Recurring Engagements (Ref: Para. 26) 
A44. The practitioner may decide not to send a new engagement letter  or other written agreement for a 
recurring engagement. However, the following factors may indica te that it is appropriate to revise the 
terms of the engagement, or to remind the engaging party of the existing terms of the engagement: 
x Any indication that the engaging party misunderstands the purpose of the agreed-upon procedures 
engagement or the nature, timing or extent of the agreed-upon procedures. 
x Any revised or special terms of the engagement, including any c hanges in the previously agreed-
upon procedures. 
x A change in legal, regulatory or contractual requirements affecting the engagement. 
x A change in management or those charged with governance of the engaging party.  
Performing the Agreed-Upon Procedures (Ref: Para. 28) 
A45. The practitioner may decide to request written representations in some circumstances, for example: 
x If the agreed-upon procedures involve inquiries, the practition er may request written 
representations on the responses that have been provided verbally. 
x If the engaging party is not the responsible party, the practitioner may agree with the engaging party 
to include, as an agreed-upon procedure, requests for written r epresentations from the responsible 
party.  
 
Using the Work of a Practitioner‚Äôs Expert (Ref: Para. 29) 
A46. Using the work of a practitioner‚Äôs expert may involve the use of an expert to assist the practitioner in: 
x Discussing with the engaging party the agreed-upon procedures t o be performed. For example, a 
lawyer may provide suggestions to the practitioner on the desig n of a procedure to address legal 
aspects of a contract; or

 PART I  : SEC.(1) ‚Äì GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 19.08.2022  
 
x Performing one or more of the agreed-upon procedure(s). For example, a chemist may perform one 
of the agreed-upon procedures such as determining the toxin levels in a sample of grains. 
A47. A practitioner‚Äôs expert may be an external expert engaged by the practitioner or an internal expert who 
is part of the firm and therefore subject to the firm‚Äôs system of quality control. The practitioner is entitled 
to rely on the firm‚Äôs system of quality control, unless informa tion provided by the firm or other parties 
suggests otherwise. The extent of that reliance will vary with the circumstances and may affect the 
nature, timing and extent of the practitioner‚Äôs procedures with respect to matters such as: 
x Competence and capabilities, through recruitment and training programs. 
x The practitioner‚Äôs evaluation of the objectivity of the practitioner‚Äôs expert. 
x Agreement with the practitioner‚Äôs expert. 
Such reliance does not reduce the practitioner‚Äôs responsibility to meet the requirements of this SLSRS.  
A48. If the practitioner‚Äôs expert is p erforming one or more of the a greed-upon procedure(s), the agreement 
of the nature, scope and objectives of that expert‚Äôs work as re quired by paragraph 29(b) includes the 
nature, timing and extent of the procedure(s) to be performed by the practitioner‚Äôs expert. In addition to 
the matters required by paragraph 29(b), it may be appropriate for the practitioner‚Äôs agreement with the 
practitioner‚Äôs expert to include matters such as the following: 
(a) The respective roles and responsibilities of the practitioner and that expert; 
(b) The nature, timing and extent of communication between the practitioner and that expert, including 
the form of any report to be provided by that expert; and 
(c) The need for the practitioner‚Äôs expert to observe confidentiality requirements.  
A49. The matters noted in paragraph A47 may affect the level of deta il and formality of the agreement 
between the practitioner and the practitioner‚Äôs expert, includi ng whether it is appropriate that the 
agreement be in writing. The agreement between the practitioner  and the practitioner‚Äôs external expert 
is often in the form of an engagement letter.  
A50. When the work of a practitioner‚Äôs  expert is to be used, it may be appropriate to perform some of the 
procedures required by paragraph 29 at the engagement acceptance or continuance stage.  
 
The Agreed-Upon Procedures Report (Ref: Para. 30‚Äì33) 
A51. Appendix 2 contains illustrations of agreed-upon procedures reports.  
Subject Matter on which the Agreed-Upon Procedures Are Performed (Ref: Para. 30(c)) 
A52. If applicable, to avoid misunderstanding, the practitioner may wish to clarify that the agreed-upon 
procedures report does not extend to information beyond subject  matters on which the agreed-upon 
procedures are performed. For example, if the practitioner was engaged to perform agreed-upon 
procedures on an entity‚Äôs accounts receivable and inventory, th e practitioner may wish to include a 
statement that the agreed-upon procedures report relates only t o these accounts and does not extend to 
the entity‚Äôs financial statements taken as a whole. 
Purpose of the Agreed-Upon Procedures Report (Ref: Para. 30(d)) 
A53. In addition to the statement required by paragraph 30(d), the practitioner may consider it appropriate to 
indicate that the agreed-upon procedures report is intended sol ely for the engaging party and the 
intended users. Depending on the law or regulation of the parti cular jurisdiction, this may be achieved 
by restricting the distribution or use of the agreed-upon procedures report. In some jurisdictions, it may

jurisdictions, it may be possible to restrict the distribution of the agreed-upon procedures report but not 
its use. 
A54. Factors that the practitioner may consider in deciding whet her to restrict the distribution or use of 
agreed-upon procedures report (if permitted to do so) include, for example whether:
x There is an elevated risk of users other than the intended users misunderstanding the purpose of the
agreed-upon procedures engagement or misinterpreting the findings.
x The agreed-upon procedures are designed solely for the use of i nternal users such as management
and those charged with governance of the engaging party.
x The agreed-upon procedures or findings involve confidential information.
Agreed-Upon Procedures and Findings (Ref: Para. 30(n)‚Äì30(o))
A55. If the practitioner is unable to describe the agreed-upon p rocedures or findings without including 
confidential or sensitive information, the practitioner may consider:
x Consulting internally (for example, within the firm or network firm);
x Consulting externally (for example, with the relevant professional body or another practitioner); or
x Obtaining legal advice,
to understand the professional or legal implications of taking any particular course of action.
A56. There may be circumstances when the fact that previously ag reed-upon procedures have not been 
performed or have been modified is important to the intended us ers‚Äô consideration of the agreed-upon 
procedures and findings. For example, this may be the case when  the procedures are set out in law or 
regulation. In such circumstances, the practitioner may identif y, in the agreed-upon procedures report, 
the procedures agreed in the original terms of the engagement w hich could not be performed or were 
modified, and why that has arisen.
A57. The practitioner may refer to the date when the agreed-upon procedures were agreed in the terms of the 
engagement. 
Reference to Practitioner‚Äôs Expert (Ref: Para. 31)
A58. In some circumstances, law or regulation may require a reference, in the agreed-upon procedures report, 
to a practitioner‚Äôs expert who performed any of the agreed-upon procedures. For example, such a 
reference may be required for the purposes of transparency in t he public sector. The practitioner may 
also consider it appropriate in other circumstances, for exampl e, when referring to the practitioner‚Äôs 
expert when describing the agreed-upon procedures. Nonetheless,  the practitioner has sole 
responsibility for the findings included in the agreed-upon pro cedures report, and that responsibility is 
not reduced by the use of the practitioner‚Äôs expert. It is impo rtant therefore that if the agreed-upon 
procedures report refers to the practitioner‚Äôs expert, the repo rt does not imply that the practitioner‚Äôs 
responsibility is reduced because of the reference to the practitioner‚Äôs expert.
Undertaking an Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement Together with another Engagement (Ref: 
Para.34)
A59. A practitioner may be reques ted to perform other engagement s together with the agreed-upon 
procedures engagement, such as providing recommendations arisin g from the agreed-upon procedures

engagement. Such requests may take the form of one request for the practitioner to perform agreed-
upon procedures and make recommendations, and the terms of the various engagements may be set out 
in a single engagement letter. To avoid misunderstanding, parag raph 34 requires that the agreed-upon 
procedures report be clearly dis tinguished from the reports of other engagements. For example, the 
recommendations may be: 
x Provided in a separate document from the agreed-upon procedures report; or 
x Included in a document that contains both the agreed-upon procedures report and recommendations 
but the recommendations are clearly differentiated from the agr eed-upon procedures report, for 
example, by including the agreed-upon procedures report and the  recommendations in separate 
sections of the document. 
Documentation (Ref: Para. 35)  
A60. Documentation of the nature, timing and extent of the agre ed-upon procedures performed may include 
a record of, for example: 
x The identifying characteristics of the subject matter(s) on whi ch the agreed-upon procedures are 
performed. Identifying characteristics will vary depending on t he nature of the agreed-upon 
procedure and the subject matter(s) on which the agreed-upon pr ocedure is performed. For 
example: 
o For a procedure on purchase orde rs, the practitioner may identi fy the documents selected by 
their dates and unique purchase order numbers. 
o For a procedure requiring selection of all items over a specific amount from a given population, 
the practitioner may record the scope of the procedure and identify the population (for example, 
all journal entries over a specified amount from the journal re gister for a specific period, all 
timesheets for hours recorded over a certain number for specifi ed months or every tenth item 
on a specific list). 
o For a procedure requiring inquiries of specific personnel, the practitioner may record the dates 
of the inquiries, the names and job designations of the personn el and the specific inquiries 
made. 
o For an observation procedure, the  practitioner may record the p rocess or matter being 
observed, the relevant individuals, their respective responsibi lities, and where and when the 
observation was carried out. 
x Who performed the agreed-upon procedures and the date such procedures were performed. 
x Who reviewed the agreed-upon procedures performed, and the date and extent of such review.

Procedures Findings
1 Obtain from management of [Engaging 
Party] a listing of all contracts signed 
between [January 1, 20X1] and [December 
31, 20X1] for [xyz] products (‚Äúlisting‚Äù)

Procedures Findings
2 For each identified contract valued at over 
Rs.25,000 on the listing, compare the 
contract to the records of bidding and 
determine whether the contract was 
subject to bidding by at least 3 contractors 
from [Engaging Party]‚Äôs ‚ÄúPre -qualified 
Contractors List.‚Äù For records of bidding 
that were submitted in [foreign language], 
translate the records of bidding with the 
assistance of a translator engaged by the 
practitioner before performing the 
comparison.
We inspected the records of bidding related to the 37 
contracts valued at over Rs.25,000. Of the records of 
bidding related to the 37 contracts, 5 were submitted in 
[foreign language]. We engaged a translator to assist us 
in the translat
ion of these 5 records of bidding.
We found that 36 of the 37 contracts were subject to 
bidding by at least 3 contractors from [Engaging 
Party]‚Äôs ‚ÄúPre-qualified Contractors List.‚Äù
We found 1 contract valued at Rs. 65,000 that was not 
subject to bidding. Management has represented to us 
that the reason that this contract was not subject to 
bidding was due to an emergency to meet a contractual 
deadline.
The engagement of the translator to assist us in the 
translation of the records of bidding does not reduce 
our responsibility for performing the procedures and 
reporting the findings.
3 For each identified contract valued at over 
Rs.25,000 on the listing, compare the 
amount payable per the signed contract to 
the amount ultimately paid by [Engaging 
Party] to the supplier and determine 
whether the amount ultimately paid is the 
same as the agreed amount in the contract.
We obtained the signed contracts for the 37 contracts 
valued at over Rs.25,000 on the listing and compared 
the amounts payable in the contracts to the amounts 
ultimately paid by [Engaging Party] to the supplier.
We found that the amounts payable in the signed 
contracts differed from the amounts ultimately paid by 
[Engaging Party] for 26 of the 37 contracts. In all these 
cases, management has represented to us that the 
difference in the amounts were to accommodate an 
increase of 1% in the sales tax rate of [jurisdiction] that 
became effective in September 20X1.
