 Calculation of deprivation score for an individual is done in three steps;
 1. calculation of indicator deprivation
 2. calculation of weight for indicators
 3. calculation of weighted deprivation score for individual
Calculation of indicator deprivation
If individual i, owns indicator j, then his/her indicator deprivation can be calculated using the following equation;
xj (i) is the individual value on indicator j
then
μj (i) = 1 ; if individual deprived in indicator j
μj (i) = 0; if individual does not deprived in indicator j

formula for weight function
Weights are generated using frequency-based weight function. indicators are weighted considering relative 
importance of the different deprivations by districts using household income and expenditure survey (hies) 
conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics once in three years. The weights will be fixed for this 
calculation for a period of time for each district and review once a new hies data become available.
Where ; fj  denotes the proportion of people who are deprived on jth indicator in the ith district in the hies sample 
and k is the number of indicators (i = 1,2 ............................. 25 districts).
Lower weights mean to the criterion in which many people are less deprived to be, that is lower weights indicate 
lower importance. higher weights mean high frequency of 'deprived people' in a criterion that people are highly 
belong to deprivation of that criterion. higher weights indicate greater importance.
Calculation of weighted deprivation score for individual
Where; μwi  is the weighted deprivation score for ith individual. Weighted deprivation score is getting values between 
0 and 1 in which towards zero (0) is less deprived and towards one (1) is highly deprived.
Note :  cut off is decided on poorest 40% considering the per capita expenditure values using recently past 
household income and expenditure survey data conducted by the department of census and statistics.
