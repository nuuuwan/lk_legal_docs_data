Award
1. The honourable Minister of labour and labour relations by virtue of the powers Vested in him by section 4 (1) of 
the Industrial disputes act chapter 131 of the legislative enactments of Ceylon (1956 revised edition) as amended by 
acts No. 14 of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 read with industrial disputed (special Provision) act No. 37 of 1968 
appointed me by his order dated 4.12.2014 and referred the dispute between the aforesaid parties to me for settlement 
by arbitration.
 The matter in dispute between aforesaid parties are,
 whether Mr. h. A. Gunarathne who worked as a lift Operator of Onali holdings l Td. had been caused injustice on 
this reinstatement with effect from 09.06.2005 and whether he has been placed in a justifiable salary scale and if so 
what relief he is entitled.
2. Mr. N. s. K. jayasingha appeared on behalf of the applicant and Mr. Yohan Kurera Attorney At law appeared for the 
responded organization.
 Applicant filed a long statement in support of his claim. Although the applicant has mentioned that respondent party 
as filed a written statement such statenment is not in a the main record.
 This inquiry had to be postponed due to several reasons. Proceeding will testify about such postponements, but 
nevertheless on 22.02.2018 (page 54) parties came to a settlement, this settlement is a full and final settlement. The 
applicant agreed to receive a sum of Rs. 50,000/- from the respondent and company, which sum was paid by cheque 
in open court to the applicant on 04.04.2018 (page 55)
I consider this as a fair and just award.   
 
U. Samaraweera,
 Arbitrator.
