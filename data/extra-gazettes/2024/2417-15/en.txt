Straight baselines are defined connecting fringing islands along a coast, across the mouths of 
rivers, or across the mouths of bays;
“boat” means a vessel of less than 24 m in length, or a vessel of less than 150Gt . a boat can be a boat, 
air cushion vehicle, sailing craft, inflatable craft;
“coastal waters” means all waters on the seaward side of the baseline other than exposed waters and 
extending up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline;

“exposed waters” means all waters on the seaward side of the baseline from which the territorial waters 
are measured up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline;
“internal waters” means all water and waterways on the landward side of the baseline from which the 
territorial waters are measured;
“length” means either 96 per cent of the total length on a waterline at 85 per cent of the least moulded 
depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the foreside of the stem to the 
axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, whichever is the greater. In a boat designed with a 
rake of keel, the waterline on which this length is measured should be parallel to the design 
waterline;
“nautical mile” means 1852 m;
“nominated point of departure” means the designated point of departure of the boat, as specified on 
the boats Certificate. Where this point lies within the Internal waters, it is to be taken as the
