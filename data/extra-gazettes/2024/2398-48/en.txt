The witness further said following Grades were amended to Grade 9 B to Grade 8 B
i.  Air Conditioning Technicians
ii. Electrical Technicians
iii. Diesel Technicians
iv. Data Operators
v.  Receptionists
vi.Telephone Operators
vii.Beuticians
The witness further said since the Applicant has not worked 15 years as a Cameraman he was not considered to be 
promoted. (Wa 9 and Wa 10)
During Cross examination witness further stated as follows.
The riggers duties are climb to transmission tower, ﬁ xing cables and maintenance towers.
There are about 15 employees of 9B grade in the Co-operation. Some of them were promoted 8B even without 
interview being held.
After analyzing the evidence of the given I arrived at following conclusion..
i. On 1991.12.16, the Applicant was recruited as a rigger, Grade 9 B after an interview and competitive examination
ii. As a rigger he performed important and risky tasks such as climbing to transmission tower, ﬁ xing cables and 
maintenance.
iii. In 1996 (1996.08.09.) others were promoted to Grade 8 B, except the Applicant.
iv. Though the Applicant was promoted to Trainee Camera Technician on 01.04.2005 he was not proper salary scale. 
He was placed on Rs. 16040/= scale when others were paid 16,305/=
v. The Applicant has followed 1 year course in Electrical Technician at Government Technical College. His 
professional qualiﬁ cations were neglected by the Respondent.
After taking into totality of evidence, I have come to following conclusion.
a. The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the Applicants denying him appropriate salary scale.
b. The Respondent has acted maliciously and irresponsible manner be little Applicant's contribution as a rigger.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe 
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable. he is not tied down and fettered by the 
terms of the contract of employement. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. 
The effect of the award is to introduced terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that 
as industrial arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in contrasts to a judje who enforces rights and liablilities 
arising out an existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment 
to come into force in the future when he cannot get the parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines 
the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my ﬁ nding that the Respondent, Sri Lanka Rupawahini Co-operation has caused injustice
