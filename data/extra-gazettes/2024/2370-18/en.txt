   20.  Disciplinary Inquiries.–
  (i) An Employee may be suspended without pay by his Employer pending an inquiry on a charge which 
warrants dismissal or where, in the Opinion of the Employer, a breach of the peace, damage to property 
or disturbance of business needs to be avoided. Where an Employee is suspended without pay he shall 
be notiﬁ ed in a general manner of the reasons for such suspension within 3 days of the actual suspension.
  (ii) An employee may also be suspended  with pay pending a disciplinary investigation and inquiry, where 
the Management deems that such measure is necessary. 
  (iii) An Employee is entitled to be furnished with a 'show ca use' notice setting out the charges of misconduct 
alleged against him and the employee shall be granted not less than seven (7) clear working days in 
which to give the answer or explanation. Where necessary  the employee may request further time and 
the Employer shall permit a reasonable amount of time depending on the nature of the charges, but not 
exceeding a total of 14 working days, other than in exceptional circumstances.
 
  (iv) If the Employer is satisﬁ  ed with the written explanation, the employee shall be exonerated of the charge 
or charges and  where appropriate he shall be summoned  to report back for work. Where the explanation 
is unsatisfactory, the Employer shall hold a disciplinary inquiry within a reasonable length of time and 
shall commence such inquiry within 30 working days from the dat e on which the explanation to the ' 
show cause' letter is received, unless circumstances prevent the employer.
  (v) An Employee shall be permitted to have a Union member to defend him at the inquiry. Such representative 
shall not be a professional. If the employee wishes to have the  beneﬁ t of such representation he shall 
inform the Superintendent of the name of the person defending him at least 48 hours before the inquiry 
is due to commence. The Superintendent may object to the indivi dual selected in which event the 
accused employee may nominate another representative. The failure of an employee to be defended by 
a representative shall not vitiate the inquiry.
 
  (vi) The Employer shall endeavour to give the ﬁ  ndings and convey the punishment, if any,  within a period 
of 30 working days from the date on which the inquiry is concluded, unless there is justiﬁ cation for the 
delay. In no case shall the ﬁ ndings be delayed beyond 90 working days from the date of conclusion of the 
inquiry, save and except in the case of a pending criminal investigation. If no ﬁ ndings are given within 
90 working days and the above exception does not apply, the accused employee shall be exonerated of 
the charges.
  (vii) Notwithstanding the above provisions, an Employer may, where the circumstances so  warrant, 
terminate an employee summarily. In such event the letter of te rmination shall set out the reasons for 
termination, including the justiﬁ cation for summary termination. In such event, the Union may a ppeal 
to the Employer or to the appropriate forum.
   
21.  Suspension Pending Disciplinary Inquiries
