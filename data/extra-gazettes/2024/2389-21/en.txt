ESTAbLIShmENT   Of  NATIONAL   hOSPITAL ,  GALLE
CONSIDERING the socio-economic benefits gained by the catchment population of the Southern Part of the country and 
the Teaching Hospital - Karapitiya has already fulfilled required service criteria for categorizing as a National Hospital, it 
was proposed to establish National Hospital, Galle replacing the Teaching Hospital - Karapitiya.
   As per the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers made at the Cabinet meeting held on 13.05.2024, the Teaching 
Hospital - Karapitiya was upgraded and re-categorized as the National Hospital, Galle.
