agreement for the above two pensioners with the OUSL but when t his case was started the above two 
employees were in the active service. Due to the long period taken for this case, the two employees had 
gone to their compulsory pension. Other two employees are in active service.
   ( b) The second party acted according to the circulars issued by the University Grants Commission time to 
time and acted according to the circular 9/2013. They have given proper promotion and salary steps after 
2018. R13, R18 marked by ﬁ rst party, one increment per two years paid during the years from 2013 to

Rs. 18, 550.00 for Mr. J.P. Bandula and Mr. S.P. Chandana Kumara, Mr. H.M. Gunadasa Rs. 18,395.00 
and Mr. S.W.R. Weerakoon Rs. 19,170.00. It was done with the ap proval of the controlling council

 AWARD
 After the three inquires, it is highlighted that there is no d ispute between the said two parties and both parties agreed 
that these salary reduction and adjustment done according to th e circulars issued by the UGC. Still there are small 
diﬀ erences shown in the requested salary scale and that which was paid. The OUSL may write to the UGC for further

   After taking into totality of evidence, I have come to follo wing conclusion:
 ( a) The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the  Applicant denying her promotion as decided by 
political victimisation committee.
 ( b) The Respondent has acted maliciously towards the Applicant depriving her due promotion and salary increments 
on time.
 ( c) The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the  Applicant not allowing the Applicant to work 
till 60.
   In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of t he Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe 
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just a nd equitabe, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms 
of the contract of employment. He can create new rights and int roduce new obligations between the parties. The eﬀ ect of 
the award is to introduce terms which become implied terms of t he contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator 
creates a new contract for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract. 
An industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force in the future when he 
cannot get the parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
   For the reasons aforesaid it is my ﬁ  nding that the Respondent National Housing Development Authori ty. (party of 
the Second part)
   In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party 
of the First part: Applicant Ms. G. A. P. Jayasinghe be paid a sum of Rupees Eight Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Nine 
Hundred and Forty Four. (Rs. 8,98,944/-) (Rs. 37,456/- x 2 x 12 ) as Compensation equivalent to 2 years salary by the 
Respondent National Housing Development Authority (party of the Second part)
   And the aforesaid money should be deposited by the Party of the Second part at the oﬃ   ce of the Assistant 
Commissioner of Labour, Colombo South.
   I  further make order that this award should be implemented within  21 days of the publication in the Government 
Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
   I consider this award is just and equitable.
