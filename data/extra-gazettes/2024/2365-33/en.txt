PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 03.01.2024 
SLFRS 16-Leases 
102A After the commencement date, the seller-lessee shall apply paragraphs 29–
35 to the right-of- use asset arising from the leaseback and paragraphs 36 –
46 to the lease liability arising from the leaseback. In applying paragraphs 
36–46, the seller-lessee shall determine ‘lease payments’ or ‘revised lease 
payments’ in a way that the seller -lessee would not recognise any amount 
of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. 
Applying the requirements in this paragraph does not p revent the seller -
lessee from recognising in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the 
partial or full termination of a lease as required by paragraph 46(a). 
C1D Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback, issued in September 2022, 
amended paragraph C2  and added paragraphs 102A and C20E. A seller -
lessee shall apply these amendments for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is permitted. If a seller-lessee 
applies these amendments for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact. 
C20E Lease liability in a sale and leaseback 
A seller -lessee shall apply Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (see 
paragraph C1D) retrospectively in accordance with LKAS 8 to sale and 
leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application.

LKAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements 
69 (d) it does not have the right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. 
72A Right to defer settlement for at least twelve months (paragraph 69(d)) 
An entity’s right to defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting  period must have substance and, as illustrated in 
paragraphs 72B–75, must exist at the end of the reporting period. 
72B An entity’s right to defer settlement of a liability arising from a loan 
arrangement for at least  twelve months after the reporting period may be 
subject to the entity complying with conditions specified in that loan 
arrangement (hereafter referred to as ‘covenants’). For the purposes of  
applying paragraph 69(d), such covenants: 

<!-- page 6 -->

6A  I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2024'01'03 
PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 03.01.2024 
(a) affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period—
as illustrated in  paragraphs 74 –75—if an entity is required to
comply with the covenant on or before  the end of the reporting
period. Such a covenant affects whether the right exists at the end of
the reporting period even if compliance with the covenant is
assessed only after the reporting period (for example, a covenant
based on the entity’s financial position  at the end of the reporting
period but assessed for compliance only after the reporting period).
(b) do not affect whether that right ex ists at the end of  the reporting
period if an entity is  required to comply with the covenant only
after the reporting period (for example, a  covenant based on the
entity’s financial position six months after the end of the reporting
period).
75A Classification of a liability is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will 
exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period. If a liability meets the criteria in 
paragraph 69 for classification as non-current, it is classified as non-current 
even if management intends or expects the entity to settle the liability within 
twelve months after the reporting period, or even if the entity settles the 
liability between the end of the reporting pe riod and the date the financial 
statements are authorised for issue. However, in either of those 
circumstances, the entity may need to disclose information about the timing 
of settlement to enable users of its financial statements to understand the 
impact of the liability on the entity’s financial position (see paragraphs 
17(c) and 76(d)). 
76 If the following events occur between the end of the reporting 
period and the date the financial statements are authorised for issue, 
those events are disclosed as n on‑adjusting events in  accordance 
with LKAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period: 
(a) refinancing on a long‑term basis of a liability classified as current
(see paragraph 72);
(b) rectification of a breach of a long‑term loan arrangement
classified as current (see paragraph 74);
(c) the granting by the lender of a period of grace to rectify a breach
of a long‑term loan arrangement classified as current (see
paragraph 75); and
(d) settlement of a liability classified as non-current (see paragraph
75A).

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 03.01.2024 
76ZA In applying paragraphs 69–75, an entity might classify liabilities arising 
from loan arrangements as non -current when the entity’s right to defer 
settlement of those liabilities is subject to the  entity complying with 
covenants within twelve months after the reporting period (see paragraph 
72B(b)). In such situations, the entity shall disclose information in the notes 
that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that the 
liabilities could become repayable within  twelve months after the reporting 
period, including: 
(a) information about the covenants (including the nature of the
covenants and when the entity is required to comply with them) and
the carrying amount of related liabilities.
(b) facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have
difficulty complying with the covenants —for example, the entity
having acted during or after the reporting period to avoid or
mitigate a potential breach. Such facts and circumstances could
also include the fact that the entity would no t have complied with
the covenants if they were to be assessed for compliance based on
the entity’s circumstances at the end of the reporting period.
76A Settlement (paragraphs 69(a), 69(c) and 69(d)) 
For the purpose of classifying a liability as current or non-current, settlement 
refers to a transfer to the counterparty that results in the extinguishment of 
the liability. The transfer could be of: 
(a) cash or other economic resources—for example, goods  or
services; or
(b) the entity’s own equity instruments, unless paragraph 76B
applies.
76B Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its 
settlement by the  transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments do not 
affect its classification as current or non - current if, applying LKAS 32 
Financial Instruments: Presentation, the entity classifies the option as an 
equity instrument, recognising it separately from the liability as an equity 
component of a compound financial instrument. 
139U Classification of Liabilities as Current or  Non-current, issued in January 
2020 amended paragraphs 69, 73, 74 and 76 and added paragraphs 72A, 
75A, 76A and 76B. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 retrospectively in 
accordance wit h LKAS 8. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity 
applies those amendments for an earlier period after the issue of Non -
current Liabilities with Covenants (see paragraph 139W), it shall also apply 
Non-current Liabilities with Covenants for that peri od. If an entity applies 
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current for an earlier period, 
it shall disclose that fact.

139W Non-current Liabilities with Covenants, issued in October 2022, 
amended paragraphs 60, 71, 72A, 74 and 139U and added paragraphs 72B 
and 76ZA. An entity shall apply: 
(a) the amendment to paragraph 139U immediately on issue of Non-
current Liabilities with Covenants.
(b) all other amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2024 retrospectively in accordance with LKAS
8. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies these
amendments for an earlier period, it shall also apply
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non -current for that
period. If an entity  applies Non-current Liabilities with
Covenants for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.
LKAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows 
44F Supplier Finance Arrangements 
An entity shall disclose information about its Supplier Finance 
Arrangements (as described in  paragraph 44G) that enables users of 
financial statements to assess the effects of those  arrangements on the 
entity’s liabilities and cash flows and on the entity’s exposure to liquidity  
risk. 
44G Supplier Finance Arrangements are characterised by one or more finance 
providers offering to pay amounts an entity owes its suppliers and the entity 
agreeing to pay according to the terms and conditions of the arrangements 
at the same date as, or a date later than, suppliers are paid. These 
arrangements provide the entity with exten ded payment terms, or the 
entity’s suppliers with early payment terms, compared to the related invoice 
payment due date. Supplier Finance Arrangements are often referred to as 
supply chain finance, payables finance or reverse factoring arrangements. 
Arrangements that are solely credit enhancements for the entity (for 
example, financial guarantees including letters of credit used as guarantees) 
or instruments used by the entity to settle directly with a supplier the 
amounts owed (for example, credit cards) a re not Supplier Finance 
Arrangements. 
44H To meet the objectives in paragraph 44F, an entity shall disclose in 
aggregate for its Supplier Finance Arrangements: 
(a) the terms and conditions of the arrangements (for example, extended
payment terms  and security or guarantees provided). However, an
entity shall disclose separately the terms and conditions of
arrangements that have dissimilar terms and conditions.
(b) as at the beginning and end of the reporting period:
(i) the carrying amounts, and associated line items presented in the
entity’s statement of financial position, of the financial
liabilities that are part of a supplier finance arrangement.

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 03.01.2024 
(ii) the carrying amounts, and associated line items, of the financial
liabilities disclosed under (i) for which suppliers  have already
received payment from the finance providers.
(iii) the range of payment due dates (for example, 30–40 days after
the invoice date)  for both the financial liabilities disclosed
under (i) and comparable trade payables  that are not part of a
supplier finance arrangement. Comparable trade payables are,
for example, trade payables of the entity within the same line
of business or jurisdiction as the financial liabilities disclosed
under (i). If ranges of payment due  dates are wide, an entity
shall disclose explanatory information about those ranges or
disclose additional ranges (for example, stratified ranges).
(c) the type and effect of non -cash changes in the carrying amounts of
the financial liabilities disclosed under (b)(i). Examples of non -cash
changes include the effect  of business combinations, exchange
differences or other transactions that do not require the use of cash or
cash equivalents (see paragraph 43).
62 Supplier Finance Arrangements, issued in May 2023, added paragraphs 
44F–44H. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is 
permitted. If an entity applies those amendments for an earlier period, it 
shall disclose that fact. 
63 In applying Supplier Finance Arrangements, an entity is  not 
required to disclose: 
(a) comparative information for any reporting periods presented
before the beginning of the annual reporting period in  which the
entity first applies those amendments.
(b) the information otherwise required by paragraph 44H(b)(ii)–(iii)
as at the beginning of the annual reporting period in  which the
entity first applies those amendments.
(c) the information otherwise required by paragraphs 44F–44H for any
interim period presented within the annual reporting period in
which the entity first applies those amendments.
LKAS 12 – Income Taxes 
4A This Standard applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or 
substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 
including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top - up 
taxes described in those rules. 

<!-- page 10 -->

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 03.01.2024 
Such tax law, and the income taxes arising from it, are hereafter referred to 
as ‘Pillar Two legislation’ and ‘Pillar Two income taxes’. As an exception 
to the requirements in this Standard, an entity shall neither recognise nor 
disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 
Two income taxes. 
88A International tax reform—Pillar Two model rules 
An entity shall disclose that it has applied the exception to recognising and 
disclosing information about deferred tax assets and  liabilities related to 
Pillar Two income taxes (see paragraph 4A). 
88B An entity shall disclose separately its current tax expense (income) related to 
Pillar Two income  taxes. 
88C In periods in which Pillar Two legislation is enacted or substantively 
enacted but not yet in effect, an entity shall disclose known or reasonably 
estimable information that helps users of financial statements understand 
the entity’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that 
legislation. 
88D To meet the disclosure objective in paragraph 88C, an entity shall disclose 
qualitative and  quantitative information about its exposure to Pillar Two 
income taxes at the end of the reporting period. This information does not 
have to reflect all the specific requirements of the Pillar Two legislation and 
can be provided in the form of an indicative range. To the extent information 
is not known or reasonably estimable, an entity shall instead disclose a 
statement to that effect and disclose information about the entity’s progress 
in assessing its exposure. 
Examples illustrating paragraphs 88C –88D Examples of information an 
entity could disclose to meet the objective and requirements in paragraphs 
88C–88D include: qualitative information such as information about how 
an entity is affected by Pillar Two legislation and the main jurisdictions in 
which exposures to Pillar Two income taxes might exist; and  quantitative 
information such as:  an indication of the proportion of an entity’s profits 
that might be subject to Pillar Two income taxes and the average effective 
tax rate applicable to those profits; or  an indication of how the entity’s 
average effective tax rate would have changed if Pillar Two legislation had 
been in effect. 
98M International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules, issued in May 2023, 
added paragraphs 4A and 88A–88D. An entity shall: 
(a) apply paragraphs 4A and 88A immediately upon the issue of these
amendments and retrospectively in accordance with LKAS 8; and
(b) apply paragraphs 88B–88D for annual reporting periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2023. An entity is not required to disclose the
information required by these paragraphs for any interim period
ending on or before 31 December 2023.
