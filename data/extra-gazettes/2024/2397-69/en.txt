Rationale for the consideration of the Primary Business of Strategic Importance
the objectives of the Colombo Port City economic Commission, as stipulated in section 5 of the Colombo Port 
City economic Commission act, No. 11 of 2021, have been considered in designating the business as a Primary 
Business of strategic importance, in order to ensure the success of establishing the Colombo Port City, having 
regard to the national interest or the advancement of the national economy as provided for in section 53(5) of the 
said act.
COLOMBO MariNa deveLOPMeNt  (Priv ate) LiMited, a company incorporated in sri Lanka and wholly 
owned by Browns investment PLC, has leased 4 land plots 1-02-07, 1- 02-08, 1-02-09 and 1-02-10 for the Marina 
development project within the area of authority of the Colombo Port City . as per the disclosures made in 
december 2021, investment made for the said land plots amounted to LKr 11,129 million (usd 36 million) and 
a further usd 75 million in fdi for the development would be made by the company. this resulted in a total 
investment of approximately usd 111 million.
Thus, COLOMBO MARINA DEVELOPMENT (PRIV ATE) LIMITED satisfies the criteria set out in Regulation 
2 (b) of the Colombo Port City (guidelines on the grant of exemptions or incentives to Businesses of strategic 
importance) regulations, No. 2 of 2023 which states that an authorised Person who makes an investment of a 
minimum of USD twenty-five million in the plots of land for the Marina infrastructure shall be designated as a

and Control Center), club house including club rooms for guests, retail outlets including food and beverage and 
entertainment venues, events spaces and car parking spaces. the spaces will offer a comprehensive suite of amenities 
and services specifically designed to cater to the needs of affluent visitors. The development across the four plots of 
land would include a gross floor area of the built up spaces would be approximately 20,000 square meters. It will 
offer a diverse range of entertainment, shopping, and urban amenities, significantly enhancing Sri Lanka’s overall 
tourism experience. this strategic approach is expected to lead to increased tourist spending, further contributing 
to the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
The Marina development project is expected to create significant employment opportunities throughout its various 
phases. The company intends to employ approximately 50 individuals within the first year of commencing 
operations. Upon completion, Marina’s retail businesses and other ventures are expected to create many permanent 
jobs, contributing to long-term economic growth.
