1.3 Principles of Public Procurement
1.3.1 Primary Principles of Public Procurement
Primary Principles of Public Procurement mainly emphasize v alue for money (vFm). 
vFm is the achievement of the desired outcomes of the procurement at the most optimum price, not 
necessarily the lowest price based on a balanced judgment of financial and non-financial factors relevant 
to the procurement. vFm includes the following;
(a) Economy;
economy is spending less, considering the necessity to handle public funds with care and due diligence 
to ensure that the prices paid for Goods, Works and Services are fair and reasonable with appropriate 
quality and provide excellent value for the public funds used to procure them in order to meet the 
functional requirement. economy does not necessarily mean the lowest cost/price.
(b) Efficiency;
Efficiency is the careful consideration of the relationship between the financial and non-financial 
resources expended in the procurement of Goods, Works and Services and the results/outputs of the 
procurement. 
(c) Effectiveness;
Effectiveness is spending wisely to achieve the intended outcome of public funds. 
(d) Equity;
equity is spending fairly to ensure that Goods, Works, and Services are available and accessible to 
all relevant stakeholders.

14A
1.3.2 Other Principles of Public Procurement
(a) Transparency;
Transparency in Public Procurement means that information on the public Procurement Process must 
be available to all relevant stakeholders such as contractors, suppliers, service providers and the general 
public at large, unless there are valid and legal reasons to keep certain information confidential.
(b) Integrity;
Integrity is related to the ethical values of honesty and truthfulness. It is considered a key instrument 
to promote good governance in Public Procurement. It demonstrates a strong character imbued with 
moral principles and conviction to do the right thing even in difficult circumstances in line with the 
organizational values. Integrity is the use of funds, resources, assets, and authority, according to the 
intended Officer purposes in line with public interest.
(c) Fairness;
Fairness means reasonableness and impartiality. Fairness operates in a manner that is perceived as 
offering an equal opportunity for bidders to win contracts in accordance with an agreed set of rules 
that are not “prejudiced” against bidders.
(d) Openness;
openness means that, given the use of public funds, Public Procurement opportunities should be open 
to all qualified firms and individuals, and the public should have access to information pertaining to 
Public Procurement.
(e) Cost-effectiveness;
Cost-effectiveness is the use of resources to achieve the intended outcome. Cost-effective procurement 
is the process of obtaining Goods, Works, or Services in the most efficient and economical way. 
(f) Competitiveness;
In relation to Public Procurement, competitiveness means giving all qualified potential bidders the 
maximum opportunity to participate in the Procurement Process by providing sufficient time and 
adequate information about the needs of the Procuring entity.
(g) Accountability;
Accountability is undertaking responsibility for actions taken and being accountable for those actions.
