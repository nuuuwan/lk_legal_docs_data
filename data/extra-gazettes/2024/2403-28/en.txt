Preamble
 
THIS CHARTER is prepared in recognition of the 200th anniversary of the arr ival of the Indian Origin Tamil (IOT) 
(Malaiyaha  Tamils) plantation community (plantation community) to Sri Lanka.
WHEREAS , over the past two centuries, the plantation community has pla yed a pivotal role in the economic, social and 
cultural fabric of Sri Lanka. Their hard work and dedication ha ve been instrumental in transforming Sri Lanka into one of 
the world’s leading tea producers,  contributing signiﬁ cantly to the nation's economy and global standing.
WHEREAS, the tea industry, driven by the labour of the plantation community, has not only brought economic prosperity 
but has also shaped the social and cultural landscape of Sri Lanka.
WHEREAS, the vibrant culture, rich traditions, and resilience of the p lantation community have become integral parts of 
the Sri Lankan identity.
WHEREAS, despite their invaluable contributions, the Government recognises that the plantation community has historically 
faced marginalisation, with limited access to land, education, healthcare, and other essential services. This marginalisation 
has perpetuated cycles of poverty and social exclusion, leaving the community with limited opportunities for upward mobility 
and full integration into the broader Sri Lankan society.
THIS CHARTER is in recognition of the immense contributions made by the plantation community to Sri Lanka and is a 
commitment by the Government of Sri Lanka to rectify historic hardships and wrongs faced by the community.
THIS CHARTER sets out a comprehensive framework for the full integration and upliftment of the plantation community, 
ensuring that they enjoy equal rights, opportunities, and beneﬁ ts as all other citizens of Sri Lanka.
THIS CHARTER is not only a recognition of past contributions but also a forward-looking document that aims to build a 
more inclusive and equitable society for future generations.
THIS CHARTER is a declaration of the Government’s intent to ensure that the plantation community is no longer marginalised 
but is instead recognised, respected, and integrated into the socio-economic fabric of the nation. By committing to the initiatives 
outlined in this Charter, the Government of Sri Lanka is taking concrete actions to ensure that the plantation community is 
no longer marginalised but is fully integrated into the nation’s socio-economic fabric.
THIS CHARTER is a testament to the Government’s dedication to creating a ju st and fair society where every citizen, 
regardless of their background, has the opportunity to thrive.

CHAPTER 1 
Vision Statement
The Government of Sri Lanka envisions a future where the  Plantation community is fully integrated into the nation's socio - 
economic fabric, enjoying equal rights  opportunities, and beneﬁ ts as all other citizens. This vision is anchored in the principles 
of equity, dignity, and empowerment, aiming to rectify historical injustices and build a prosperous, inclusive society. 
The Government's vision is one where the plantation community is no longer seen as a marginalised group but as an integral 
part of the national identity, contributing to and sharing in the prosperity if the country.
The vision also recognises the need for systemic change. It acknowledges that addressing the issues faced by the plantation 
community requires more than just surface- level interventions;  it requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that 
tackles the root cause of inequality and exclusion. This includ es reforming existing policies, creating new opportunities 
for economic and social advancement, and ensuring that the voices of the plantation community are heard and respected in 
national decision - making processes,  
The Government is committed to ensuring that future generations of the plantation community have the same opportunities 
for success as any other citizen of Sri Lanka. This includes access to quality education, healthcare, housing and employment 
opportunities, as well as the ability to fully participate in the cultural and social life of the country. 
CHAPTER 2
Recognition of Contributions
The Government of Sri Lanka formally acknowledges  the immense contributions of the plantation community to the 
nation's economy and social and cultural fabric.
The Government recognises that the plantation community has been instrumental in making Sri Lanka one of the world's 
leading tea producers, thereby earning signiﬁ cant foreign exchange and sustaining the livelihoods of thousands of families. 
The Government recognises that the prosperity enjoyed by many sectors of Sri Lankan soci ety today is, in no small part, 
due to the sweat, and toil of plantation workers who, despite t heir invaluable contributions, have often been denied the 
recognition and rewards they deserve.
The Government recognises that beyond their economic contributions, the IOT/ Malaiyaha c ommunity has also enriched 
the cultural and social landscape of Sri Lanka. Their traditions, festivals, and cultural practices have become an integral part 
of the nation's diverse cultural tapestry. The Government is committed to ensuring that this cultural heritage is preserved and 
celebrated as part of the broader Sri Lankan identity.
The Government also recognises the signiﬁ cant social contributions made by the plantation community. Despite challenging 
living conditions and historic social exclusion, the community has shown remarkable  resilience and solidarity, maintaining

strong family and community ties, and contributing to the social fabric of the nation. The Government. commits to honouring 
these contributions by ensuring that the community is fully integrated into the national social framework, with acccess to the 
same rights, privileges, and opportunities as other citizens.
The Government acknowledges  that these contributions have often been overlooked or underva lued and that this has 
contributed to the systemic inequalities faced by the community.
This Charter is a commitment to rectifying these wrongs and ensuring that the conributions of the plantation community are 
recognised and rewarded in a meaningful way.
CHAPTER 3
National Commitments
The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to addressing the hist orical and ongoing challenges faced by the plantation 
community.
These commitments are rooted in the recognition of the immense contributions made by the plantation community to the 
nation's economy and social and cultural fabric.
These commitments are also rooted in the recognition of the urg ent need to rectify the social and economic disparities that 
have persisted for generations between the plantation community and wider Sri Lankan society.
The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to further develop and implement the following policies and initiatives to realise 
the vision for the plantation community.
These commitments are designed in promote equity, dignity, and full integration of the plantation community into Sri Lankan 
society.
CHAPTER 4
Land and Housing
4.1 Land Ownership
 The issue of land ownership is particularly critical given the  historical context in which the plantation cnmmunity has 
lived. For decades, plantation workers have lived in line rooms provided by the estate companies, with no legal ownership 
or security of tenure. This has left them vulnerable to eviction and has perpetuated a cycle of poverty and dependency.
 The Government will take action to provide a plot of land to e very plantation worker family for occupancy. This 
allocation of land is not just about providing physical space to live but about restoring dignity and a sense of belonging 
to a community that has long been deprived of land ownership.

<!-- page 7 -->

Pൺඋඍ I: Sൾർ. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF S RI LANKA  – 25.09.2024
 7A
 Mechanisms will also be established to convert any existing la nd permits held by estate workers into freehold land deeds.
 Land ownership is a fundamental right and a crucial step towar d economic empowerment, allowing families to build 
secure homes, cultivate their own crops, promote additional income generation and create a stable foundation for future 
generations.
 By granting land ownership, the Government is committed to bre ak, the cycle of poverty and dependency and to provide 
the community with the means to achieve greater enconomic and social independence.
 Moreover, this policy will help to address the long-standing i ssues of overcrowding and inadequate housing in the plantation 
sector. By providing each family with a plot of land, the Government will enable the construction of more spacious and 
digniﬁ ed homes, improving living conditions and promoting better health and well-being among the community.
4.2 Housing
 Many plantation workers live in cramped, substandard housing (line rooms) that lacks basic amenities such as clean - 
 water, sanitation, and electricity. This has had a detrimental  impact on their health, education, and overall well-being.
 A comprehensive housing policy will be formulated to replace l ine rooms with digniﬁ ed housing units. These new homes 
may be funded either through private ﬁ nancing. Government grants or Government blacked loans and should be equipped 
with essential services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity, and built to withstand the environmental challenges 
of the upcountry region. Special attention will be given to ensuring that these housing units are close to existing places 
of employment to reduce the burden on workers.
 The Government recognises that the development of new housing units is essential to improving the quality of life for 
the plantation community.
4.3 Conversion of Settlements into Villages
 For decades, plantation settlements have existed as isolated e nclaves, controlled by the plantation companies and largely 
excluded from the beneﬁ ts of national development. This has left the community with limited access to essential services 
such as healthcare. education, and infrastructure, further entrenching their marginalisation.
 The Government is committed to converting the current settleme nts within the estates into recognised and sustainable 
villages. This initiative will involve taking these settlements out of the control of plantation companies and integrating 
them into the national administrative framework, thereby providing the residents with full access to Government services 
and infrastructure. This includes access to clean water, sanitation, electricity, roads, and public transportation, as well as 
Government-run schools and healthcare facilities. The integration of these settlements into the national administrative 
framework will also provide residents with greater political representation and inﬂ uence, enabling them in advocate for 
their rights and needs more eﬀ ectively

<!-- page 8 -->

 8A
 This move is crucial for ensuring that the plantation communit y has the same rights and opportunities as other rural 
communities in Sri Lanka.
 Additionally, this policy will help to break the dependency of  the plantation community on the plantation companies. By 
transferring control of the settlements to the Gevernment, the community will gain greater autonomy and the ability to 
make decisions about their own development. This is a crucial s tep towards empowering the community and ensuring 
that they have a say in the policies and programmes that aﬀ ect their lives.
CHAPTER 5
Employment
The Government recognises the employment within the plantation community has historically been centred around the daily 
wage model, which has proven to be unsustainable and detrimental  to the long-term well being of workers.
The Government of  Sri Lanka recognises the need to transition to more sustainable and equitable employment models that 
ensure the protection of workers'  rights and provide them with opportunities for upward mobility.
5.1 Sustainable Employment Models
 The daily wage  model  has long been criticised for its inhere nt instability and its failure to  provide workers with a living 
wage. Under this model, workers are paid based on the amount of work they complete each day, with no guarantees of 
consistent  income or job security. This has left many plantation workers living in poverty, with little hope of improving 
their economic situation.
 The Government is committed to transition away from the daily wage model to more equitable systems such as the out-
grower and small holder models. These models  will empower workers by providing them with ownership stakes in the 
land they caltivate, thereby enhancing their ﬁ nancial security and social standing.
 The transition to more sustainable employment models is essent ial adressing these issues. The out-grower model, for 
example, allows workers to own and cultivate their own plots of land, with the plantation company providing technical 
support, inputs, and access to markets. This model provides workers with greater control over their livelihoods, as well 
as the potential to earn higher incomes based on their productivity. It  also encourages the development of entrepreneurial 
skills and sense of ownership among wurkers.
 Similarly, the small holder model allows workers to own larger  plots of land and operate as independent farmers, supplying 
produce to the plantation company or selling it on the open market. This model provides even greater opportunities for 
economic empowerment, as workers can diversify their income sources and invest in their own businesses.
 The Govemment will provide support to workers who wish to tran sition to these models, including access to credit, 
training, and technical assistance.

Pൺඋඍ I: Sൾർ. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF S RI LANKA  – 25.09.2024
 9A
 These models also have the potential to address some of the br oader challenges facing the plantation sector, such as 
declining productivity and the need for more sustainable agricultural practices. By empowering workers in take greater 
ownership of their land and livelihoods, these models can contribute to the long-term viability of the sector and the well-
being of the community.
5.2 Labour Rights and Social Security
The Government will enforce strict regulations to ensure that plantation companies comply with labour laws, including 
the provision of Employee's  ‘Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’,  Trust Fund (ETF) beneﬁ ts to all workers. This 
will include workers involved in out-grower models, who have often been excluded  from such beneﬁ ts.
The enforcement of labour rights is a critical component of the Government's commitment to improving the conditions 
of employment in the plantation sector. The Government recognis es that workers have been denied basic rights and 
protections, including access to social security beneﬁ ts such as EPF and ETF. This has left many workers without a safety 
net in times of need and has contributed to the cycle of poverty in the community.
 The Government is committed to ensuring that all workers in th e plantation sectot, regardless of their employment model, 
have access to these beneﬁ ts. This includes workers involved in out-grower and small hol der models, who have often 
been excluded from social security programmes due to their stat us as independent contractors. The Government will 
work with plantation companies and other stakeholders to develop mechanisms for extending social security coverage 
to all workers, including those who are self-employed or working in non-traditional employment arrangements.
 In addition to social security beneﬁ  ts, the Government will enforce regulations  related to working conditions, including 
hours of work, occupational health and safety, and the right to collective bargaining. This will help to ensure that workers 
are treated fairly and with dignity, and that they have the tools and resources they need to advocate for their rights. The 
Government will also strengthen the capacity of labour inspection services to monitor compliance with labour laws and 
take action against employers who violate workers' rights.
 These measures are essential to improving the quality of emplo yment  in the plantation sector and ensuring that workers 
have access to the protections and beneﬁ  ts they are entitled to. They also reﬂ  ect the Government's commitment to 
promoting docent work in the sector.
5.3. Negotiations with Plantation Companies
The relationship between workers and plantation companies has o ften been characterised by power imbalances and a 
lack of meaningful dialogue, Workers have had little say in the terms and conditions of their employment and this has 
resulted in exploitative practices, such as low wages, poor working conditions, and unfair pricing of produce.
The Government recognises the need for a more balanced and equi table relationship between workers and plantation 
companies. To this end, it will act as a mediator in negotiatio ns between the two parties, ensuring that the voices of 
workers are heard and that their interests are taken into account.

Pൺඋඍ I: Sൾർ. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF S RI LANKA  –25.09.2024
 10A
In addition to economic issues, the Government will also address issues related to working conditions, including health and 
safety, access to training and development opportunities, and t he right to organise and bargain collectively. By fostering a 
more collaborative and equitable relationship between workers a nd plantation companies, the Government aims to create 
a more sustainable plantation sector.
CHAPTER 6
Economic Upliftment
Economic upliftment is a critical component of the Government's vision for the plantation community. The goal is to create a 
diversiﬁ ed economy within the upcountry region that is not solely dependent on plantation work but also oﬀ ers opportunities 
in other sectors.
6.1 Creating New Employment Opportunities
 The Government recognises that the economy of the upcountry re gion has been historically dominated by the plantation 
sector. This has resulted in fewer opportunities for workers to pursue other forms of employment and has limited their 
ability to improve their economic situation.
 The Government recognises the need to create new employment op portunities in the upcountry region, particularly in 
sectors that oﬀ er higher wages, better working conditions, and greater opportunities for skills development. To this end, 
it will work with international partners to attract investment and establish new industries in the region. These industries 
could include manufacturing, agro-processing, tourism, and info rmation technology, among others. The Government 
will also invest in infrastructure development, including roads , electricity, and telecommunications, to support the 
growth of these industries.
 The diversiﬁ  cation of industries in the upcountry region will not only pro vide new employment opportunities but will 
also contribute to the broader economic development of the region. It will help to raise living standards, reduce poverty, 
and create a more vibrant and diversiﬁ ed local economy. It will also provide workers with the opport unity to acquire 
new skills and pursue career paths that were previously unavailable to them.
6.2 Entrepreneurship
 The Government will promote entrepreneurship within the planta tion community by providing training programmes, 
access to credit, and business development services. This will empower community members to start their own 
businesses and create jobs within their communities. The promotion of entrepreneurship is a key strategy for economic 
upliftment in the upcountry region. By encouraging community members to start their own businesses, the Government 
aims to create new sources of income and employment, reduce dependency on plantation work, and foster a culture of 
innovation and self- reliance.

Pൺඋඍ I: Sൾർ. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF S RI LANKA  – 25.09.2024
 11A
 The Government is committed to provide a range of support serv ices to aspiring entrepreneurs, including training 
programmes in business management, ﬁ nancial literacy, and marketing. It will also work with ﬁ nancial institutions to 
improve access to credit for small businesses, particularly tho se owned by women and other marginalised groups. In 
addition, the Government will establish business development ce ntres and societies and entrepreneurship incubation 
centres in the upcountry region to provide entrepreneurs with t he technical assistance, mentoring, and networking 
opportunities they need to succeed. 
 The promotion of entrepreneurship will also help to stimulate local economic development by creating new markets for 
goods and services and by encouraging the growth of local supply chains. It will also contribute to the diversiﬁ cation of 
the local economy, increasing the community's resilience to economic shocks.
6.3 Public-Private Partnerships
 The Government will encourage public-private partnerships to f und and implement economic development projects 
in the upcountry region. These partnerships will focus on build ing infrastructure, improving access to markets, and 
enhancing the overall economic environment in the region. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are an important tool for 
promoting economic development in the upcountry region. By leveraging the resources and expertise of both the public 
and private sectors, PPPs can help to accelerate the implementation of development projects, improve the eﬃ  ciency of 
service delivery, and attract investment to the region.
 The Government will actively seek out partnerships with private sector companies, both domestic and international, to 
fund and implement key infrastructure projects in the upcountry  region. This could include the construction of roads, 
bridges, and other transportation infrastructure; the development of water and sanitation systems; and the expansion of 
electricity and telecommunications networks. These projects wil l help to improve the quality of life for the plantation 
community, as well as create new economic opportunities by improving access to markets and services.
 In addition to infrastructure development, the Government will  also explore PPPs in areas such as education, healthcare, 
and agriculture. For example, partnerships with private sector companies could help to improve the quality of education 
and healthcare services in the upcountry region, or to promote the adoption of new agricultural technologies and 
practices. These partnerships will be carefully designed to ens ure that they deliver tangible beneﬁ ts to the plantation 
community and that they are aligned with the Government's broader development goals.
 The promotion of PPPs will also help to build the capacity of local Government authorities and other public sector 
institutions in the upcountry region. By working with private s ector partners, these institutions can gain valuable 
experience and expertise in project management, service deliver y, and stakeholder engagement, which will help to 
improve their performance and sustainability in the long term.

CHAPTER 7
Health
The Government recognises that the health and well-being of the  plantation community has been neglected, with many 
workers suﬀ ering from inadequate access to healthcare services.
The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to rectifying this situation by implementing comprehensive health policies that 
address the speciﬁ c needs of the plantation community.
7.1 Cluster Hospitals
 The Government will implement the cluster hospital concept, co nverting estate medical centres into cluster hospitals. 
These hospitals will provide a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, maternal and child health 
services, and treatment for chronic conditions. The Government will also seek funding for the acquisition of ambulances 
to serve these hospitals.
 The cluster hospital concept involves the consolidation of mul tiple estate medical centres into larger, better-equipped 
hospitals that can provide a full range of medical services. Th ese hospitals will be staﬀ  ed by trained healthcare 
professionals and will be equipped with modern medical equipmen t and facilities. They will also be supported by a 
network of ambulances that can transport patients to the hospitals in case of emergency.
 The cluster hospitals will focus on providing primary and seco ndary healthcare services, including preventive care, 
diagnosis, and treatment of common illnesses, maternal and child health services, and management of chronic conditions 
such as diabetes and hypertension. They will also provide specialised services, such as mental health care, reproductive 
health services, and care for the elderly and disabled.
 The Government will also work to improve the infrastructure an d facilities at the cluster hospitals, including the 
provision of clean water, sanitation, and electricity. This wil l help to create a safe and hygienic environment for both 
patients and healthcare workers.
 The implementation of the cluster hospital concept will help t o improve health outcomes for the plantation community 
by providing them with access to high-quality healthcare services that are closer to home. It will also help to reduce the 
burden on the public healthcare system by providing care to a population that has historically been underserved.
7.2 Mental Health and Well-being
 Mental health has long been a neglected aspect of healthcare, despite the high levels of stress and mental health issues 
experienced by workers. The demanding nature of plantation work, coupled with the challenges of living in isolated and 
often impoverished conditions, has contributed to high rates of  depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems 
among the community.

Pൺඋඍ I: Sൾർ. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF S RI LANKA  – 25.09.2024
 13A
 The Government is committed to addressing this issue by integr ating mental health services into the cluster hospitals 
and other community facilities. This will include the provision  of counselling and psychological support services, as 
well as stress management programmes and initiatives to promote  mental well-being. The Government will also work 
to raise awareness about mental health issues and reduce the st igma associated with seeking help for mental health 
problems.
7.3 Preventive Healthcare and Nutrition
 The Government will implement programmes to raise awareness ab out preventive healthcare, including vaccination 
campaigns, health education, and nutrition programmes. Special attention will be given to addressing malnutrition 
among children and pregnant women, ensuring that they receive the necessary nutrients for healthy development.
 Preventive healthcare is a critical component of the Governmen t's strategy to improve health outcomes in the plantation 
sector. By focusing on prevention, the Government aims to reduce the burden of disease and improve the overall health 
and well-being of the community.
 Nutrition is also a key focus of the Government's preventive h ealthcare strategy, given the high levels of malnutrition 
among children and pregnant women in the plantation sector. Mal nutrition is a major contributor to poor health 
outcomes, including stunted growth, low birth weight, and incre ased susceptibility to illness. The Government will 
implement programmes to improve access to nutritious food, incl uding the distribution of supplements and fortiﬁ  ed 
foods, as well as programmes to promote breastfeeding and healthy feeding practices.
 The Government will also work to address the underlying causes  of malnutrition, such as poverty, food insecurity, and 
lack of access to clean water and sanitation. This will include initiatives to improve food production and distribution, as 
well as programmes to promote food security and reduce waste. The Government will also work with local communities 
to promote healthy eating habits and improve access to safe, nutritious food.
 These preventive healthcare and nutrition programmes will help  to reduce the incidence of illness and improve the 
overall health and well-being of the plantation community. They will also contribute to the long-term sustainability of 
the healthcare system by reducing the demand for curative services and improving health outcomes.
CHAPTER 8
Education
Education is a key pillar of the Government's vision for the pl antation community, as it provides the foundation for long-
term socio-economic development.
The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to improving education al outcomes for the plantation community through 
comprehensive education reforms.

8.1 Early Childhood Education
 Early childhood education is critical to ensuring that childre n in the plantation sector have the best possible start in life. 
Research has shown that early childhood is a crucial period for brain development, and that high-quality early education 
can have long-lasting beneﬁ ts for children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.
 The Government will transform creches into early learning cent res, providing children with a strong foundation for 
their future education. These centres will oﬀ  er a stimulating learning environment, qualiﬁ  ed teachers, and nutritious 
meals to support children's physical and cognitive development.  The curriculum will also be designed to support the 
development of key skills, including language, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving, as well as social and emotional 
skills.
 The centres will also oﬀ  er health and developmental screenings to identify any potenti al issues early on and provide 
appropriate interventions. The Government will also work to eng age parents and caregivers in their children's early 
education, providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to support their children's learning and development 
at home.
 The transformation of creches into early learning centres is a  key component of the Government's strategy to improve 
educational outcomes in the plantation sector. By providing chi ldren with a strong foundation in the early years, the 
Government aims to ensure that they are well-prepared for success in primary school and beyond.
8.2 Primary and Secondary Education
Primary and secondary education are critical stages in a child's development and are essential for ensuring that children 
acquire the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life. However, the quality of education in the plantation sector 
has historically been poor, with inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and a shortage of trained teachers.
The Government is committed to addressing these issues by inves ting in the improvement of primary and secondary 
education in plantation areas. This will include upgrading school infrastructure, such as classrooms, libraries, laboratories 
and accommodation, to ensure that students and teachers have ac cess to a safe and conducive teaching and learning 
environment. providing tri-lingual education (Sinhala, Tamil, English), and introducing smart classrooms equipped with 
modern technology.
In addition to infrastructure improvements, the Government will  also focus on improving the quality of teaching and 
learning in plantation schools. This will include the provision of tri-lingual education (Sinhala, Tamil, English) to ensure 
that students are proﬁ cient in all three languages and can compete eﬀ ectively in the national and global job markets. The 
Government will also introduce smart classrooms equipped with m odern technology, such as interactive whiteboards 
and digital learning platforms, to support personalised and adaptive learning.

The Government will also invest in teacher training and profess ional development to ensure that teachers in plantation 
schools are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to  deliver high-quality instruction. This will include 
training in the use of technology in the classroom, as well as training in inclusive and diﬀ erentiated teaching practices 
to meet the diverse needs of students.
These investments in primary and secondary education will help to improve educational outcomes for students in the 
plantation sector, ensuring that they have the knowledge and sk ills they need to succeed in higher education and the 
workforce.
8.3 Higher Education and Skill Development
Higher education is a key driver of social and economic mobilit y, and the Government is committed to ensuring that 
students from the plantation community have access to high- quality higher education opportunities.
The Government will establish a university in Nuwara Eliya. This university will provide higher education opportunities 
to students from the plantation community, equipping them with the skills needed for the modern workforce. The 
establishment of a university in Nuwara Eliya will provide stud ents in the upcountry region with access to higher 
education, especially in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering , and Mathematics) and IT ﬁ elds, which are critical 
to the future economic development of the region and the countr y as a whole. The university will oﬀ  er a range of 
undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in these ﬁ elds, as well as opportunities for research and innovation.

CHAPTER 9
Child Welfare and Development
The Government of Sri Lanka acknowledges that children in the plantation sector face signiﬁ cant challenges that hinder their 
overall development and well-being. High levels of poverty, lim ited access to quality education and healthcare, and child 
protection issues are pervasive problems. The Government is committed to addressing these challenges through comprehensive 
child welfare and development policies aimed at promoting the rights of children and ensuring their protection and well-being.
9.1 Access to Quality Education
 Children in the plantation sector have historically faced barr iers to accessing quality education, including inadequate 
school infrastructure, lack of qualiﬁ ed teachers, and socio-economic constraints that force many ch ildren to drop out of 
school early. This lack of educational opportunities perpetuates the cycle of poverty and limits the prospects of children 
in the plantation community.
 The Government is committed to ensuring access to quality education to all children in the plantation sector, to empowering 
them, ensuring they remain in school and providing them with the tools they need to build a better future.
 The Government will work to improve educational infrastructure  in the plantation sector, including building and upgrading 
schools, providing modern teaching aids, and ensuring access to clean water and sanitation facilities in schools.
9.2 Child Protection and Safety
 Child protection is a critical concern in the plantation secto r, where children are vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, child 
labour, and traﬃ  cking. The Government recognises that a robust child protection framework is essential for safeguarding 
children's rights and ensuring their safety and well-being
 The Government will strengthen the child protection framework in the plantation sector by enhancing the coordination 
between relevant stakeholders, including law enforcement, judiciary, health, and education sectors.
 Comprehensive state-led mechanisms will be implemented to rais e awareness, prevent, identify, and respond to child 
abuse, exploitation, and traﬃ  cking. These mechanisms will include awareness campaigns, acc essible services such as 
counselling, medical care, and legal and psychosocial support for victims and at-risk children.
9.3 Child Health and Nutrition
 Malnutrition and poor health outcomes are prevalent among chil dren in the plantation sector, contributing to stunted 
growth, cognitive delays, and higher susceptibility to illness. These issues are compounded by limited access to healthcare 
services and inadequate knowledge about proper nutrition and hygiene practices. Addressing the health and nutrition needs 
of children is crucial for ensuring their overall development and well- being.

 17A
 The Government will implement comprehensive programmes  to improve child nutrition, including school meal programmes 
that provide nutritionally balanced meals, particularly in areas with high rates of malnutrition.
 Awareness and education campaigns will be conducted to promote  proper dietary practices, breastfeeding, and hygiene 
among parents and caregivers. These campaigns will disseminate information on low-cost, nutritious foods and best 
practices for child nutrition.
 The Government will work with health authorities to ensure tha t preventive healthcare services, such as vaccinations and 
health screenings, are readily available to children in the pla ntation sector. Additional eﬀ orts will be made to provide 
specialised health services for children who are malnourished or have chronic health conditions.
9.4 Prevention of Child Labour
 Child labour remains a signiﬁ  cant issue in the plantation sector, where economic pressures often force children to work 
instead of attending school. This not only deprives children of their right to education but also exposes them to dangerous 
and exploitative working conditions. The Government is committe d to eradicating child labour and ensuring that all 
children have the opportunity to pursue their education and development without being forced into work.
 The Government will strengthen the enforcement of existing chi ld labour laws, ensuring that all forms of child labour are 
eliminated in the plantation sector.
 The Government will also oﬀ  er more vocational training and skills development programmes to children aged 16 and 
older, providing them with alternative pathways to employment a nd reducing the likelihood that they will drop out of 
school to seek work.
9.5 Multi-Sectoral Collaboration
 Addressing the complex challenges faced by children in the pla ntation sector requires collaboration across multiple sectors, 
including education, health, law enforcement, and social servic es. The Government recognises that a coordinated and 
integrated approach is essential for ensuring the eﬀ ectiveness of child welfare and development policies.
 The Government will build capacity and enhance coordination am ong all relevant stakeholders, including Government 
agencies, law enforcement, judiciary, labour inspectors, employers, trade unions, civil society organisations, and community 
leaders to respond eﬀ ectively to child welfare and protection issues. This will ensure that child protection laws are enforced 
and that child welfare services are delivered eﬀ ectively across the plantation sector.

CHAPTER 10
Youth Empowerment
 The youth of the plantation community represent a vital resour ce for the future of Sri Lanka. However, young people 
in the plantation sector face signiﬁ cant challenges, including limited access to quality education , lack of employment 
opportunities, and social and economic marginalisation. These challenges often hinder their ability to achieve their full 
potential and contribute to the development of their communities and the country. Recognising the importance of youth 
empowerment, the Government of Sri Lanka is committed to implementing policies and programmes that address these 
challenges and provide young people with the tools, resources, and opportunities they need to succeed.
10.1 Access to Education and Vocational Training
 Education and vocational training are critical pathways to eco nomic empowerment and upward mobility for youth in the 
plantation sector. However, many young people face barriers to accessing these opportunities due to ﬁ nancial constraints, 
lack of infrastructure, and social pressures to enter the workforce at an early age. The Government recognises that ensuring 
access to quality education and vocational training is essential for enabling young people to pursue meaningful careers 
and improve their socio-economic standing.
 The Government will expand access to secondary and tertiary ed ucation in the plantation sector by establishing new 
educational institutions, upgrading existing schools, and providing scholarships and ﬁ nancial aid to ensure that all young 
people can continue their education beyond primary school.
 V ocational training programmes will be oﬀ  ered, focusing on skills that are in demand in both the local and national job 
markets. These programmes will include training in ﬁ elds such as information technology, hospitality, manufacturing, 
agriculture, and entrepreneurship.
 The Government will also promote ﬂ  exible and alternative education pathways, including online and distance learning, 
to accommodate the unique needs and circumstances of youth in the plantation sector. This will help to ensure that young 
people who are unable to attend traditional schools or training centres still have access to education and skill development 
opportunities.
10.2 Employment and Entrepreneurship Opportunities
 Youth unemployment is a major challenge in the plantation sect or, where economic opportunities are often limited to 
low-wage and hazardous jobs. Many young people are forced to migrate to urban areas in search of work, leaving their 
communities behind and contributing to the brain drain in rural  regions. The Government is committed to creating 
sustainable employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for young people in the plantation sector, enabling them to 
build successful careers and contribute to the economic development of their communities.

 The Government will work with the private sector, civil societ y and development partners to create new employment 
opportunities for young people in the plantation sector. This will include promoting job creation in emerging industries 
such as information technology, tourism, and renewable energy, as well as in traditional sectors such as agriculture and 
manufacturing.
 Entrepreneurship will be promoted as a key strategy for youth empowerment. The Government will provide training, 
mentorship, and access to credit for young entrepreneurs, enabling them to start and grow their own businesses. Special 
attention will be given to supporting young women entrepreneurs, who often face additional barriers to business ownership 
and ﬁ nancial independence.
 Public-private partnerships will be established to support you th entrepreneurship initiatives, including business incubators, 
startup competitions, and mentorship programmes. These partners hips will help to connect young entrepreneurs with 
resources, networks, and markets, increasing their chances of success.
10.3 Leadership and Civic Engagement
 The Government acknowledges that youth in the plantation secto r often lack representation in decision-making 
processes and are excluded from leadership opportunities. This marginalisation limits their ability to inﬂ uence policies 
and programmes that aﬀ ect their lives and hinders their capacity to contribute to the development of their communities. 
The Government recognises that empowering youth to take on leadership roles and participate in civic life is essential 
for fostering a sense of agency and responsibility among young people, as well as for building stronger, more resilient 
communities.
 The Government will work to strengthen civic spaces for youth participation in the plantation sector. This will include 
ensuring that youth are able to express their opinions, participate in community activities, and contribute to discussions 
on issues that aﬀ ect them.
 The Government will collaborate with civil society organisatio ns and community leaders to promote youth participation 
at the local level, ensuring that youth have opportunities to e ngage in meaningful dialogue with policymakers and 
contribute to the development of their communities and the nation.
10.4 Social Inclusion and Mental Health
Many young people in the plantation sector face social exclusion and discrimination based on their ethnicity, socio-economic 
status, or gender. This exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and poor mental health outcomes. The 
Government recognises the importance of promoting social inclus ion and mental health among youth in the plantation 
sector, ensuring that all young people feel valued, supported, and empowered to achieve their full potential.
The Government will implement programmes to promote social inclusion and reduce discrimination against youth in the 
plantation sector. These programmes will focus on fostering a sense of belonging and community among young people, 
as well as raising wareness about the negative eﬀ ects of discrimination and exclusion.

are experiencing stress, anxiety, depression substance abuse or other mental health challenges. These services will include 
counselling, peer support groups, and mental health education and rehabilitation programmes in schools and community 
centres
The Government will also promote positive youth development by supporting programmes that encourage healthy lifestyles, 
physical activity, and creative expression. These programmes will help to build resilience among young people and provide 
them with constructive outlets for their energy and creativity.
10.5  Promotion of Sports and Physical Activities
 Sports and physical activities play a critical role in the hol istic development of youth, promoting not only physical health 
but also mental well-being, teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills. However, access to sports facilities and organised 
sports programmes is often limited in the plantation sector, depriving young people of these valuable opportunities.
 The Government recognises the importance of sports as a tool f or youth empowerment and social cohesion and is committed 
to developing and promoting sports and physical activities as p art of its broader strategy for youth development in the 
plantation community.
 The Government is committed to investing in building and upgra ding sports facilities in the plantation sector, including 
playgrounds, sports ﬁ elds, and community centres. These facilities will be accessible to all young people and will provide 
safe spaces for recreational activities, team sports, and ﬁ tness programmes.
 The Government will also promote the organisation of national sports programmes and competitions in the plantation 
regions and the participation of young people from the plantation sector in them, providing them with opportunities to 
showcase their talents and represent their communities on a national platform. Special attention will be given to ensuring 
that girls and young women have equal access to sports programmes and facilities.
 The Government will also promote partnerships with sports orga nisations, civil society. and private sector sponsors to 
support the development of sports in the plantation sector, including the provision of equipment, coaching, and scholarships 
for promising athletes.
CHAPTER 11

 The Government formally acknowledges the crucial role played b y women in the plantation sector. Their labour, 
particularly in the tea industry, has been a cornerstone of Sri Lanka's economy.
 The Government commits to recognising these contributions in n ational economic policies and ensuring that women 
receive fair wages and working conditions.
 Women in the plantation sector have historically been the back bone of the tea industry. performing the physically 
demanding work of tea plucking, which requires skill, precision, and endurance. Their contributions have been critical to 
maintaining the quality and reputation of Sri Lankan tea on the global market, and their labour has generated signiﬁ cant 
revenue for the country.
 Despite their crucial role in the economy, women in the planta tion sector have often been undervalued and underpaid, 
with limited opportunities for advancement. The Government is committed to addressing this injustice by ensuring that 
women in the plantation sector are recognised and rewarded for their contributions. This will include measures to promote 
gender equality in the workplace, such as equal pay for equal w ork, access to training and development opportunities, 
and support for women in leadership roles
 The Government will also work to ensure that the contributions  of women in the plantation sector are recognised and 
celebrated in national economic policies and development plans.  This will include initiatives to promote the visibility 
of women's work, as well as eﬀ orts to raise awareness about the importance of gender equality in the economy.
11.2  Ending Gender-Based Violence
 Gender-based violence is a pervasive issue in the plantation s ector, where women are often vulnerable to exploitation, 
harassment, and abuse. The Government is committed to addressin g this issue through a comprehensive policy that 
includes prevention, protection, and support services for survivors.
 The Government will prepare and implement a comprehensive poli cy to prevent and address gender-based violence 
(GBV) within the plantation community. This policy will  be in line with the National Policy on Women’s Empowerment 
and Gender Equality. It will include setting up GBV response units within the cluster hospitals, providing legal assistance 
to survivors, and running awareness campaigns to educate the community about the rights of women and the importance 
of gender equality.

 22A
counselling, and legal assistance. The units will also work clo sely with law enforcement agencies and community 
organisations to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable and that survivors receive the support they need to recover 
and rebuild their lives.
 In addition to response services, the Government will also foc us on prevention by running awareness campaigns to educate 
the community about the rights of women and the importance of g ender equality. These campaigns will aim to change 
attitudes and behaviours that contribute to GBV , such as harmful gender norms, discrimination, and tolerance of violence. 
The Government will also work to strengthen legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms to protect women’s rights 
and prevent GBV .
 The comprehensive policy on GBV will help to create a safer an d more supportive environment for women in the plantation 
sector and will contribute to the broader goal of gender equality in Sri Lanka.
11.3 Socio-Economic Empowerment of Women
 Socio-economic empowerment is a key strategy for improving the  status of women in the plantation sector.
 The Government will support the socio-economic empowerment of women by promoting entrepreneurship, providing 
access to credit, and oﬀ ering training programmes in skills such as ﬁ nancial management and business development. These 
initiatives will enable women to start their own businesses and achieve ﬁ nancial independence. These programmes will 
also be designed to meet the speciﬁ c needs and challenges faced by women in the plantation sector, including those related 
to access to ﬁ nance, social an cultural barriers, and the balancing of work and family responsibilities.
 By  providing women with the resources and opportunities they need to start their own businesses, the Government aims 
to increase their income, improve their economic security, and reduce their dependency on plantation work.
 The Government will also work with ﬁ  nancial institutions to improve access to credit for women entrepreneurs, including 
through the provision of microﬁ nance and other ﬁ nancial products tailored to their needs.
 In addition to entrepreneurship, the Government will also supp ort women’s socio¬economic empowerment through 
initiatives to promote employment and income¬generating activities in other sectors. This could include programmes to 
train women in new skills, such as those needed for jobs in manufacturing, services, or tourism, as well as initiatives to 
improve working conditions and wages in these sectors.
 
 The socio-economic empowerment of women in the plantation, sec tor, is not only important for improving their individual 
well-being, but it is also Critical for the broader economic development of the region. By increasing women’s Participation, 
in the economy, the Government aims to create new sources of in come and employment, reduce poverty, and promote 
inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

Women have often been denied equal access to education, healthc are, and employment opportunities, and have faced 
discrimination in the workplace, including unequal pay, job segregation, and limited opportunities for advancement.
 The elimination of discrimination against women in the plantat ion sector is essential for achieving gender equality and 
for ensuring that women can fully participate in and beneﬁ t from the social and economic development of Sri Lanka. By 
addressing the root causes of discrimination and promoting equal rights and opportunities, the Government aims to create 
a more just and equitable society for all.
 
CHAPTER 12
Inclusion of Vulnerable Groups
 The Government of Sri Lanka recognises that within the plantat ion community, there are particularly vulnerable groups 
who face compounded challenges due to their social status, iden tity, or physical abilities. These include persons living 
in extreme poverty, those with disabilities or health condition s and persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender 
identities. The Government recognises that such vulnerable groups are often subjected to discrimination, marginalisation, 
and exclusion within their communities. The Government is committed to promoting the full inclusion and protection of all 
such vulnerable groups, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their social status, identity, health or abilities, can fully 
participate in and beneﬁ t from the nation’s development.
 The inclusion of vulnerable groups is a critical aspect of bui lding an equitable society. By addressing the speciﬁ c challenges 
faced by such persons in the plantation sector, the Government aims to create a more inclusive and just society where 
everyone is valued and respected.
12.1 Creating an Inclusive Environment
 Persons from vulnerable groups in the plantation sector face s igniﬁ cant barriers to accessing education, employment, 
healthcare, and public services. These barriers are often compo unded by stigma and discrimination, which limit their 
opportunities for full participation in society.

12.2 Access to Social Services and Legal Protections
 Vulnerable groups within the plantation sector, often have lim ited access to social services and legal protections. This 
lack of access leaves them vulnerable to exploitation, abuse, and neglect. The Government recognises the need to ensure 
that all members of the plantation community, particularly those who are most vulnerable, have access to the services and 
protections they need to live safe and digniﬁ ed lives.
 The Government is committed to enhance coordination among soci al service providers, law enforcement, and community

participation in the social, economic, and political life of th e country. The Government is committed to rectifying this 
injustice and ensuring that the plantation community is recognised and respected as full citizens of Sri Lanka, with all the

the dignity and humanity of the plantation community and a commitment to ensuring that they are treated with the respect 
and fairness they deserve.
