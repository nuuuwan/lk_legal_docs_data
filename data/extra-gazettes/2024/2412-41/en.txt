THE AWARD
THE  Honourable Minister of Labour by virtue of the  powers vested in him by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 
Chapter 131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revis ed Edition), as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of  1957, 4 of 
1962 and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial Disputes - Special Provisions) Act No. 37 of 1968 appointed me as Arbitrator by 
his order dated 29th June 2022 and referred the dispute to me for  settlement
The matter in Dispute referred to me by the Honourable Minister of Labour between the aforesaid parties is, 
“ Whether Mr. D. Thissa Yapa who had worked at the Open Univers ity of Sri Lanka had been caused injustice by the 
judgment given at  the  disciplinary inquiry to defer the Salar y Increments of Year 01.01.2011, 01.01.2012, 01.01.2013 
and 01.01.2014 and if so, to what relief he is entitled.”
At the very outset of the hearing of this case the Party of the second part made a preliminary objection to the eﬀ ect that since 
the University Services Appeal Board has made a determination t o the Appeal made by the party of the First part against 
the punishments imposed by the Governing Council of the Univers ity, that the party of the First Part Seeking relief again 
from the Arbitrator in regard to the same matter which has been already decided amounts to Res- Judicata and  that this case 
before the Arbitrator be dismissed.

Open University of Sri Lanka in regard to an alleged incident of unauthorized attempt to remove some unserviceable items 
from the open University by Tissa Yapa the Vice Chancellor had appointed an oﬃ  cer to conduct a preliminary investigation 
and the Investigating Oﬃ  cer had recommended that a formal inquiry be held against to said Tissa yapa.
Accordingly a Charge Sheet was issued on 22.02.2011 to the said  Tissa Yapa and a formal inquiry was held, where Tissa 
yapa (the party of the ﬁ rst part) was found guilty on all charges.
Thereafter the Governing Council of the University appointed a Committee comprising three members of the Council to 
study the report and recommend suitable punishment.
Based on the report of the Committee the Council imposed the following punishments.
  (i)  The Cancellation of four salary increments.
  (ii) The demotion of one grade from the position held at pres ent.
  (iii) The Non - extension of service beyond 57 years of age.
Tissa Yapa appealed against the punishment to the University Services Appeal Board, comprising of Chairman Justice G.W. 
Edirisuriya, Vice-Chairman Anton Alfred and Member Dr. R.M.K. Ratnayake.
The University Services Appeal Board having heard the case presented by Tissa Yapa decided on 17.08,2013 the following:
‘‘Considering the facts and the un-proportional punishments, we  allow the removal of punishments (ii) and (iii) 
and the Appeal is allowed”
Having received the above order given by the U.S.A.B. on 27.08. 2013 in response to the appeal made by Tissa Yapa, he 
continued to work as usual until he retired on 21.02.2017 having completed sixty (60) years of age.
The party of the ﬁ rst part Tissa Yapa having known that the U.S.A.B. Order altho ugh removed the punishments ii and iii 
imposed by the University Council, did not remove the punishmen t (i), that is the cancellation of four salary increments 
from the year 01.01.2011 to the year 01.01.2014, has had not initiated any action to get this particular punishment reversed, 
(except going to another forum of the “University Authorities”) from any other forum (other than the university authorities) 
by recourse to such available forum, but continued to work from  the day of the Order given by the U.S.A.B., that is from 
27.08.2013 to 21.02.2017 until he reached retirement age of sixty (60) years.
However, having received the Order of the U.S.A.B., Tissa Yapa made an appeal to the University Management Sabha (úYaj 
úoHd,hSh md,l iNdj) on 2015.04.06 asking for the removal of the punishment (i), that is the cancellation imposed for the 
four salary increments. The University Management Sabha (úYaj úoHd,hSh md,l iNdj) replied to Mr. Yapa on 2015.07.15 
that the punishment in regard to (i) would continue to remain and that the Appeal is dismissed.

Having known the ﬁ nal position taken by the University Authorities as regards pu nishment (i) by 15.07.2015, Mr. Tissa 
Yapa since the above mentioned date upto his retirement on 21.0 2.2017, after having exhausted all appeals aﬀ orded to an 
employee within the University structure to get redress, had not sought any relief regarding the same from any other forum 
by seeking recourse to such available Fora.
Since receiving the letter dated 15.07.2015 from the Vishwavidy alaleeya Palaka Sabha (University Management Sabha) 
rejecting the ﬁ nal appeal regarding the cancellation of four salary increment s the party of the ﬁ rst part (Tissa Yapa) by not 
making recourse to any other Fora, during the period from the a bove mentioned date that is 15.07.2015 to 21.05.2017 (the 
date of retirement) the ﬁ rst party by conduct has complied with the Order given by the U.S.A.B.
Further since the incident where it was alleged that Tissa Yapa attempted to remove some unserviceable items from the Open 
University, the University authorities has initiated the due process where such alleged incidents are dealt with.
However the Party of the ﬁ rst part has availed him self of all the remedial actions he c ould take within the scope of his 
employment within the University structure in respect to punishment (i). His appeal to the University Services Appeal Board 
had resulted in the removal of punishments (ii) and (iii) where  if upheld would have resulted in the demotion of one grade 
from the position he held and the non-extention of service beyond 57 years of age.
The Order given by the U.S.A.B. on 2013.08.27 by the ﬁ nal paragraph decided to remove punishments (ii) and (iii) and the 
immediately preceding paragraph states as follows:
“The decision of the Council to impose three types of punishmen ts to Mr. Tissa Yapa considering his long 
years of unblemished service to the University and age factor a re not ‘proportional’ to the proved charges. The 
Investigating Oﬃ  cer on the other hand has failed to quantify the extent of ‘p ecuniary embarrassment’ which 
warrant ‘Major’ punishments.”
U.S.A.B. however, did not remove punishment (i) by their decision on 27.08.2013.
The principles of Natural Justice entitled to the Party of the First Part has been aﬀ  orded to him as the due process of 
investigation and inquiry had been adhered to by the University  when the Chief Security Oﬃ  cer ol the Open University 
has alleged that the Party of the First Part (Tissa Yapa) attempted in remove some unserviceable items from the University. 
And also the Party of the  First Part has used up all the avenu es of redress available to him within University structure by 
15.07.2015.
As the Arbitrator of this Case. I See no reason why I should he ar a matter which had already been determined and in the 
light of the conduct by the party of the ﬁ rst part having acquiesced with the order of the university se rvices Appeal Board 
and that I make  any Award.
1 uphold the preliminary objection taken by the party of the second part.

Considering the preliminary objection made by the Party of the second part to the eﬀ ect that since the University Services 
Appeal Board has already made a determination to the Appeal made by the ﬁ rst part against the punishments imposed by the 
Governing Council of the University, that the party of the ﬁ rst part seeking relief again from the Arbitrator in regard to  the 
Same matter which has already been decided amounts to Res-Judicata and hence this case before the Arbitrator be dismissed.
For the reasons given aforesaid it is my ﬁ nding that I as the Arbitrator of this case uphold the prelimi nary Objection taken 
by the party of the second part.
Therefore regarding the dispute referred for Arbitration, I do not make an. Award.
Further I wish to reiterate that the decision regarding the Awa rd which I make has been made after fully examining the 
dispute between the parties in a just and equitable manner.
