THE  INSTITUTE  OF  CHARTERED  ACCOUNTANTS  OF  SRI LANKA
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023
iNdEpENdENT aUdiTOr’S rEpOrT
To the Members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka     
    
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements        
        
Opinion 
       
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (the institute). 
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the Institute, F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at December 31, 
2023  and financial performance of the institute  and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Accounting Standards.

2a
Basis for Opinion
        
I conducted the audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent 
of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) that 
are relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
Other Information
        
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.     
          
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.        
        
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated, If, based on the work we have performed, I conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard. 
       
        
Responsibilities of Management and those who charged with governance for the Financial Statements  
      
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal controls as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
        
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance 
are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s financial reporting process.      
      
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       
 
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  
        
As part of the audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. I also:        
        
  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud and error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to prove a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, or fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omission, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.      
 
    -  Obtaining an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Institute’s internal controls.

    -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
      
    -  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion . My conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
      
    -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation. 
      
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements       
 
I communicate with those who charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identify during the 
audit.

10A
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the ability of the Institute to continue as a going concern. 
The Council has considered the consequences of the economic crisis of the country, other events, and conditions in 
determining the going concern. Accordingly, the Council has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern and is 
satisfied that it has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Financial Statements of the 
Institute continued to be prepared on a going concern basis.
1.4 Financial Period
The financial period of the Institute represents a twelve-month period from 1st January 2023 to 31st December 2023.
1.5 Accounting for Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) 
APFASL has been set up jointly with the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy (IPFDA) 
and The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) in 2012, to enhance the capacity of 
public sector financial management professionals. Both CA Sri Lanka and IPFDA have equally contributed Rs. 
10mn as initial investment for this project. In terms of paragraph 5.9 of the Articles of Constitution of APFASL, 
on the occasion of dissolution, the fund will either be spent for collective welfare purposes or be granted 
towards any good cause as the general membership feels best.
The assets and liabilities of Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) which had 
been amalgamated with the Institute financials up to year 2015 have been de- recognised from the financial 
statements of the Institute from the year 2016 due to the amendment of certain clauses and provisions of the 
Constitution of APFASL in order to operate as a more autonomous entity.
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all factors 
and circumstances in SLFRS 10 - “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows:
(a) power over the investee
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Accordingly, Management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to variable returns 
from its involvement with APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation. 
1.6 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation and presentation of financial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, 
requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows.
a) Defined Benefit Plans
The cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) 
method. Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increases 
and retirement age. Due to the long-term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty.

b) Estimating the Incremental Borrowing Rate
As the Institute cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, it uses its incremental borrowing 
rate (IBR) to measure the lease liabilities. IBR is rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow 
similar facility from a financial institution.
c) Changes in Accounting Estimates and Judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the 
financial statements.
2.	 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies	
2.1 Assets and the Bases of Their Valuation
2.1.1	 Property, Plant and Equipment
(a)	 Basis of Recognition and Measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the asset will flow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
(b)	 Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight-line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, 
in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows;
Asset Category Useful Life
(Years)
Buildings 50
Furniture, Fittings and Fixtures 5- 10
Plant and Machinery 5-10
Motor vehicles 10
Computers 5
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier date that the asset is 
classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identified and 
depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of 
the related asset.

13A
(a)	 Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Institute recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-
use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less 
any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The estimated useful lives of right of use assets are as follows;
Asset Category Useful Life (Years)
Right of use asset 10
Improvements to Right of use asset 10
 
Depreciation of improvement to right of use asset is calculated based on the remaining lease period.
At the commencement date of the lease the Institute recognises lease liability measured at the present value 
of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, the lease payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on 
an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Institute and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Institute exercising the option 
to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses 
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.  
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Institute uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date as the discount rate, because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily 
determinable. The Institute determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from the 
Institute’s internal records. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to 
reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount 
of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease 
payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine 
such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. 
(d)	 Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year, the asset is derecognised.
2.1.2	 Library Books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years.
2.1.3	 Capital Work-In-Progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital nature, 
directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-
in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is 
available for use i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the Institute.

2.1.4	 Intangible Assets
a.	 Computer Software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to 
use. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five to ten (5-10) years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
1. it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use,
2. management intends to complete the software product and use it,
3. there is an ability to use the software product,
4. how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits can be demonstrated,
5. adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software 
product are available, and
6. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognized as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed ten 
(10) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress until the software 
is ready for use.
b.	 Study Material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA qualifications 
are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new curriculum, the 
investment attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably measured and it can be 
demonstrated that it will generate probable future economic benefits.
These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful life is reviewed 
at least at each financial reporting year end.
2.1.5	 Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and 
slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the 
estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on weighted average cost. The 
cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and 
condition.
The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.

15A
2.1.6	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such 
an indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes an estimate 
of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows 
that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot “exceed” the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.1.7	 Financial Assets - Initial Recognition and Measurement
(a)	 SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments
SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 on “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting 
for financial instruments: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting.
(b)	 Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain significant financing components for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient, 
the Institute initially measures financial assets at their fair value plus transaction costs. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a significant financing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient 
are measured at the transaction price determined under SLFRS 15.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Institute’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages financial 
assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from 
collecting contractual cash flows or selling financial assets or both.
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial 
Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 The financial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, fixed deposits held to 
collect contractual cash flows, government securities, repurchase agreements and cash and cash equivalents.
 The Institute’s financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of both of the 
following conditions
a) The financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and

<!-- page 16 -->

I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2024'04'05
Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 05.04.2024
16A
b) The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding  
Accordingly, financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) 
method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is 
derecognised, modified or impaired.
2.1.8	 Derecognition of Financial Assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised when:
l The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
l The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either
a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass- through 
arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In 
that case, the Institute also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are 
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of 
the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Institute could be 
required to repay.
2.1.9	 Impairment of Financial Assets
The Institute recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments measured at 
amortized cost.
 ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all 
the cash flows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest 
rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements 
that are integral to the contractual terms.
 For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
2.1.10	 Reclassification
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the management intends to hold these instruments to collect 
the contractual cash flows upon completion of the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test and 
evaluating the historical data. As of 1st January 2018, the Institute has elected the business model of hold to 
collect the contractual cash flows and measured the instruments at amortized cost.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare 
circumstances when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such financial assets.

<!-- page 17 -->

Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 05.04.2024
17A
Consequent to the change in the business model, if any, the Institute reclassifies all affected assets prospectively 
from the first day of the next reporting period (the reclassification date). Prior periods are not restated.
2.1.11	 Financial Liabilities
All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss. The Institute does not have financial liabilities other than payables for the year ended 31st December 
2023.
2.1.12	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash 
flows, which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
2.2 Liabilities and Provisions
A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or there is no 
unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. The 
Institute classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
2.2.1  Deferred Income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes are raised at the commencement 
of the courses where the course delivery takes place over a period of several months. Deferred income is 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken place and the balance 
attributable to the remaining course period is recognized as a liability on the statement of financial position until 
income is recognized.
2.2.2 Provisions
A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the obligation and the 
obligation can be measured reliably.
2.2.3 Employee Benefits
(a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan - Gratuity
Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan. The 
defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows, using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid 
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. The present value of 
the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions about discount rate, future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to 
the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date. Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based on the actuarial 
valuation as of 31 December 2023. The Institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognise actuarial 
gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive income.

18A
(b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund 
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognized as an expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross 
emoluments of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively.
2.2.4
 Taxation
a) Income Tax
The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act  
No. 24 of 2017 and as amended subsequently by Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 45 of 2022.
b) Deferred Taxation
Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed against 
the liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable income. Deferred tax 
has not been provided in the financial statements.
2.2.5
 Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates which 
approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets (including securities) 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange at 
that date. Non - monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated 
at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realized and unrealized exchange differences are 
reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.3 Accounting for the Receipt and Utilization of Funds, Grants and Reserves
The Institute received various grants for specific development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have been 
classified as unrestricted funds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
2.3.1	 Unrestricted Funds
Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Council and 
funds that are designated for a specific purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives of the 
Institute. Allocations made by the Council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income. Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted funds in terms of the 
relevant donor agreements or with the subsequent approval of the donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of references.
Designated Funds
Unrestricted funds designated by the Council to a specific purpose are identified as  designated funds. The 
Institute has accounted the following funds as designated funds and the purpose of such funds are elaborated 
as follows,

2.3.2	  Restricted Funds
Where grants / donations are received for use in an identified project or activity, such funds are held in a restricted 
fund account and transferred to the statement of comprehensive income to match with expenses incurred in 
respect of that identified project. Unutilized funds are held in their respective fund accounts and included under 
accumulated fund and reserves in the statement of financial position until such time as they are required.
Where approved grant expenditure exceeds the income received and there is certainty that the balance will be 
received, such amounts are recognized through receivables in the statement of financial position.

The Institute’s policies regarding the endowment funds are;
i. Investment Policy:
Funds are invested only in Government Securities and fixed deposits in state owned banks. Investments are 
made after considering the higher yield on investment, liquidity, and interest rate risk for reinvestment. All new 
investment and reinvestment decisions require the approval of the investment committee.
ii. Withdrawal Policy:
Withdrawals are not made other than at maturity. Any early withdrawal requires the approval of the investment 
committee.
iii. Fund Usage Policy:
Usage is restricted for the specific purpose for which the fund was established.
2.3.4	 Grants
2.3.4.1 Land Received as a Government Grant:
Government grants for non-monetary assets are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant 
will be received, and all attached conditions have been complied with.

The method adopted for accounting for Government grants is the income approach, where the grants relating 
to non-depreciable assets is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is treated as deemed cost of the land at the date of the recognition of Government grant given in 
the financial statements.
Grants and subsidies related to assets are generally deferred in the statement of financial position and 
credited to the statement of comprehensive income over the useful life of the asset.
2.3.4.2 Revenue Grants
Other grants are recognised in the financial statements at their fair value. When the grant or subsidy relates to 
an expense it is recognised as an income over the period necessary to match it with the costs, which is intended 
to compensate for on a systematic basis.
2.4 Statement of Comprehensive Income
2.4.1 Income Recognition
(a) Income
The sources of revenue of CA Sri Lanka are recognised as per SLFRS 15 on “Revenue from contracts with 
customers”. Accordingly, SLFRS 15 establishes five step model to account for revenue recognition at an amount 
that reflect the consideration where CA Sri Lanka expects to provide services to its stakeholders. The Institute 
has adopted SLFRS 15 using the full retrospective method based on the assessment performed and decided that 
the impact is not material to the financial statements and therefore adjustment has not been made in the retained 
earnings opening balance of the statement of changes in funds and reserves.
In terms of SLFRS 15, Revenue is recognised upon satisfactory performance obligation is achieved. CA 
Sri Lanka expects that, the revenue recognition to occur over time where stakeholders (mainly students and 
members) simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by CA Sri Lanka and when the Institute 
has an enforceable right to receive payment for performance completed. Otherwise, the revenue of the Institute 
is recognised at point in time.

Under the Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983, gratuity liability arises only upon an employee completing a continuous service of 
five years.
14.2 - Principal actuarial assumptions used 
                
              Actuarial and Management Consultants (Pvt) Ltd., qualified actuaries carried out an actuarial valuation on the defined 
benefit plan-gratuity as at 31 December 2023. The assumptions used in determining the cost of retirement benefits are 
as follows,
Assumption 2023 2022
Discount interest rate * 13% per annum 19% per annum
Staff turnover rate 20% per annum 17% per annum
Salary increment rate 10.0% 7.0%
Retirement age 60 years 60 years
*In the absence of a deep market in long term bonds in Sri Lanka, a long term interest rate of 13% p.a ( 2022 - 19% p.a) 
has been used to discount future liabilities considering anticipated long term rate of inflation.
14.3 - Sensitivity analysis
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used with all other 
variables held constant in the retirement benefit obligation measurement.

28 - Contingent liabilities          
          
The Institute had received assessments in respect of Value Added Tax (V AT) for the period commencing from 01 April 2012 
to 31 December 2014 amounting to Rs. 61mn and Nation Building Tax (NBT) for the period commencing from 01 July 
2009 to 31 December 2014 amounting to Rs. 100mn. Further, the Institute had also received an assessment in respect of 
Economic Service Charge (ESC) for the period commencing from 01 April 2009 to 31 March 2012 amounting to Rs. 4.5mn. 
The Institute had duly appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) against all the determinations of the Commissioner 
General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) in respect of above assessments. 
 TAC has determined appeals against the assessments for ESC in favour of the CGIR and the case has now been stated to 
the Court of  Appeal.
TAC has also determined appeals against the assessments for V AT and NBT  in favour of the CGIR. The Institute is currently 
awaiting the case stated from TAC to make an application to the Court of Appeal.
Having discussed with independent legal and tax experts and based on information available, the Institute is of the view 
that it is not liable for assessed taxes in the above assessments and therefore, no provision has been made in the financial 
statements.
