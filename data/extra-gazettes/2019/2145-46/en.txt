PART I: S EC. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 16.10.2019

redundant consequent upon the introduction of new computer based banking technology. It will not include a
situation where such redundant employees voluntarily leave the service of the employers on terms mutually
