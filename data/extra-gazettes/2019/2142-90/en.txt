No. 4 of 2019.
2. It shall be the duty of the owner or occupier of a factory to provide any person employed in such factory and
who is exposed to a sound pressure level of 85dB (A) or more measured with an integrating sound level meter (slow
response) with suitable ear protectors an the period of exposure of any person employed in a factory to noise and the
permitted sound pressure levels of such noise during such periods shall be as specified in the Schedule hereto.
Provided that the duration of measurement of any sound pressure level shall be lengthy enough for the resulting
noise exposure level to be representative of the activities performed by the employees. If there are significant variations
of noise level which the workers are exposed to, the sound pressure level of eight hours may be measured with the use of a
Noise Dosimeter :
Provided further, that no person employed in any factory at any time be exposed to any impact of noise or to peak
sound pressure level of 140 dB(A) or more.
3. Where any employee of a factory is subjeted to a sound pressure level exceeding the sound pressure levels as
specified in the Schedule hereto, the occupier of such factory shall adapt all or any of the following measures to maintain
such sound pressure level at the permitted sound pressure levels as are specified in the Schedule :-
(a) to reduce the sound pressure level at the source from which the sound emanates through engineering
controls by
(i) maintaining the machine in good condition, properly lubricated and replacing the worn or imbalanced
parts of the machine ;
(ii) mounting the machine on resilient mounts in order to reduce any vibration ;
(iii) using silencers or mufflers on the noisy parts of machines ;
(iv) shifting into a quiet process ;
(v) confining the sound of the machine to an acoustic enclosure ; and
(vi) isolating the operators of such machines in acoustic booths ;
(b) to carry out a programme of hearing conservation ;
(c) to adapt a feasible administrative control programme.
4. Any person who contravenes the provisions of these regulations shall be guilty of an offence.

5. For the purpose of these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires
“noise” includes any sound automatically, mechanically or electrically produced ;
“feasible administrative control programme” means any programme to reduce the duration of time period within
which an employee is exposed to excessive noise ;
“dB(A)” means the unit of measure of sound pressure level ;
“equivalent sound pressure level” means the combined effect of the daily sound level exposure measured by an
integrated sound level meter ;
“an integrated sound level meter” means a sound  level meter which integrates and accumulates the total sound
energy over a measurement period and calculates in overage, presenting the results in decibels ;
“Noise Dosimeter” means an instrument which indicates the amount of sound energy absorbed in a given period
for an individual worker. Such Noise Dosimeter shall be in conformity with the following or equivalent
standards “IEC 61252, ANSI - SI. 25”
“hearing conservation” means to protect an employee exposed to excessive sound from suffering any deterioration
of hearing, through an effective and on-going hearing conservation programme which shall include periodic
audiometric tests on heaving of every employee exposed to noise and the Periodc Sound tests in the
working areas ;
“ear protector” means any suitable device including ear plugs or ear muffs to protect the ears from noise and to
obtain necessary attenuation of noise in respect of such device.
