THE   INSTITUTE   OF   CHARTERED   ACCOUNTANTS   OF   SRI   LANKA
Financial  Statements  for  the  year  ended  31st  December  2018
INDEPENDENT   AUDITOR’S   REPORT   TO   THE   MEMBERS   OF   THE   COUNCIL   OF   THE   INSTITUTE
OF   CHARTERED   ACCOUNTANTS   OF   SRI   LANKA
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
I have audited the financial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, (‘the Institute’),
which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018, and the statement of comprehensive income,
statement of changes in funds and reserves and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. I have also audited the statements of financial position
of F.B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31
st December 2018.
In my opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Institute, F.B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at December 31, 2018, and financial
performance of the Institute and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

2A
Basis for Opinion
I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities under those standards
are further described in the Auditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I
am independent of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka
(Code of Ethics) that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with the Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for my opinion.
Other Information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the
Annual report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in
this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standardsand for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless management either intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. I also:
* Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

3A
* Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Institute’s internal control.
* Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management.
* Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Institute to cease to continue as a going concern.
* Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.
I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my
audit.

1.7 Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation and presentation of financial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards,
requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies
that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows.
a) Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) and Accounting for Association of Public
Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL)
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all
factors and circumstances in SLFRS 10 - “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows;
(a) power over the investee
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Accordingly, management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to variable
returns from its involvement with AAT or APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation.
b) Defined benefit plans
The cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC)
method. Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase and
retirement age. Due to the long term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
c) Changes in accounting estimates and judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial
statements.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 Assets and the bases of their valuation
2.1.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Basis of recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the asset will flow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured
reliably.

13A
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost
arerecognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying value of
property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable.
(b) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight line method on the cost of all property, plant and
equipment, in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows;
Asset category Useful life
Buildings 50 years
Furniture 5- 10 years
Plant and Machinery 5-10 years
Motor vehicles 10 years
Computers 5 years
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date
that the asset is classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately
identified and depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to
the statement of comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the
useful life of the related asset.
(c) Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition
of the asset is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount and included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year, the asset is
derecognised.
2.1.2 Library books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years.
2.1.3 Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital
nature, directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation.
Capital work-in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and
equipment, when it is available for use i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to
be capable of operating in the manner intended by the Institute.

2.1.4 Intangible  assets
a. Computer software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire
and bring to use. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five (5) years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense
as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following
criteria are met:
1. it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for
use;
2. management intends to complete the software product and use it;
3. there is an ability to use the software product;
4. it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic
benefits;
5. adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use
the software product are available; and
6. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably
measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognised as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do
not exceed five (5) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work
in progress until the software is ready for use.
b. Study material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the
CA qualifications are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement
the new curriculum, the investment attributable to the project during its development period can
be reliably measured and it can be demonstrated that it will generate probable future economic
benefits.
These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful
life is reviewed at least at each financial reporting year end.
2.1.5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for
obsolete and slow moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories
is based on weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories
and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and
consumables.

2.1.6 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If such indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes
an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of
assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount rate that reflects current market
assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates
used to determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If
that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased
amount cannot “exceed” the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income.
2.1.7 Financial assets – Initial recognition and measurement
(a) SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments
SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 Financial Instruments: “Recognition and
Measurement” for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, bringing together all
three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement;
impairment; and hedge accounting.
(b) Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flow characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With
the exception of trade receivables that do not contain significant financing component for which
the Institute has applied the practical expedient, the Institute initially measures financial assets
at their fair value plus transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing
component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient are measured at the
transaction price determined under SLFRS 15.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the
principal amount outstanding. The Institute’s business model for managing financial assets refers
to how it manages financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines
whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows or selling the financial
assets or both.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement
of Financial Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the
liabilities simultaneously.

<!-- page 16 -->

16A
The financial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, fixed deposits
held to collect contractual cash flows, Government securities, repurchase agreements and cash
and cash equivalents.
The Institute’s financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of
both of the following conditions:
a) The financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows ; and
b) The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
Accordingly, financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective
interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit
or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
2.1.8 Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of an Institute of similar
financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:
 • The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
• The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a
‘pass-through’ arrangement and either
(a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
(b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a
pass- through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the
asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to
the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Institute also recognises an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and
obligations that the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the
Institute could be required to repay.
2.1.9 Impairment of financial assets
The Institute recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments
measured at amortised cost.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract
and all the cash flows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the

17A
original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of
collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
2.1.10 Reclassification
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the management intends to hold these instruments
to collect the contractual cash flows upon completion of the SPPI test and evaluating the historical
data. As of 01st January 2018, the Institute has elected the business model of hold to collect the
contractual cash flows and measured the instruments at amortised cost.
Prior to 1st January 2018 financial assets were classified as Held to maturity and Available for sale. In
complying with SLFRS 9, financial assets arereclassified at amortised cost. Cumulative balance in
AFS reserve is removed and is used to adjust the reclassified amortised cost. EIR determined at initial
recognition and gross carrying amount are not adjusted as a result of reclassification.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those
rare circumstances when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such
financial assets.
Consequent to the change in the business model, the Institute reclassifies all affected assets
prospectively from the first day of the next reporting period (the reclassification date). Prior periods
are not restated.
2.1.11 Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss. The Institute does not have financial liabilities for the year ended 31st December
2018.
2.1.12 Cash and cash equivalents
The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayable
on demand and form an integral part of the Institute’s cash management are included as a component of
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand,cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase
agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement
of cash flows, which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
2.2 Liabilities and provisions
A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held
primarily for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or
there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period. The Institute classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

2.2.1 Deferred income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes  are raised  at the
commencement of the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months.
Deferred income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course
delivery taken place and the balance attributable to the remaining course period is recognised as a
liability on the statement of financial position until income is recognised.
2.2.2 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle
the obligation and the obligation can be measured reliably.
2.2.3.1 Employee benefits
(a) Employee defined benefit plan - Gratuity
Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan.
The defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC)
method.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows, using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related
liability. The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that
are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions about discount rate, future
salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates
are subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based on the actuarial valuation as of 31st December
2018. The Institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognise actuarial gains and losses in
the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive income.
(b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognised as an expense
in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of
gross emoluments of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
respectively.
2.2.4 T axation
a) Income tax
The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act,
No. 24 of 2017.
b) Other taxes
V AT has been paid in respect of rent received by the Institute, letting of movable or immovable
property, being the only taxable activity carried on by the Institute. Since the Institute is not
engaged in carrying on a trade or a business, the Institute is not liable for Economic Service
Charge or Nation Building Tax. Therefore, no provision has been made for any other taxes.

19A
c) Deferred taxation
Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed
against the liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable
income. Deferred tax has not been provided in the financial statements.
2.2.5 T ranslation of foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates
which approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date,  monetary assets
(including securities) and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan
Rupees at the rate of exchange at that date. Non - monetary assets  and liabilities in foreign currencies
that are stated at historical cost are translated at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Realised and unrealised exchange differences are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.3 Accounting for the receipt and utilisation of funds, grants and reserves
The Institute received various grants for specific development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have
been classified as unrestricted funds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
2.3.1 Unrestricted funds
Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Council
and funds that aredesignated for a specific purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives
of theInstitute.Allocations made by the Council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to
the statement of comprehensive income.Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to
unrestricted funds in terms of the relevant donor agreements or with the subsequent approval of the
donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of references.

iii. Fund usage policy:
Usage is restricted for the specific purpose for which the fund was established .
2.3.4 Grants
2.3.4.1 Land received as a government grant:
Government grants for non-monetary assets are recognised when there is reasonable assurance
that the grant will be received and all attached conditions have been complied with.
The method adopted for accounting for Government grant is income approach, where the grant
relating to non-depreciable asset is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is treated as deemed cost of the land at the date of the recognition of Government
grant given in the financial statements.
2.3.4.2 Revenue grants
Other grants are recognised in the financial statements at their fair value. When the grant or
subsidy relates to an expense it is recognised as an income over the period necessary to match it
with the costs, which is intended to compensate for on a systematic basis.
Grants and subsidies related to assets are generally deferred in the statement of financial position
and credited to the statement of comprehensive income over the useful life of the asset.
2.4 Statement of comprehensive income
2.4.1 Income recognition
(a) Income
The sources of revenue of CA Sri Lanka is recognised as per SLFRS 15 on” Revenue from
contracts with customers”.  SLFRS 15 supersedes LKAS 18 on “ Revenue”  and related
interpretations and it applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with
the customers. Accordingly, SLFRS 15 establishes five step model to account for revenue
recognition at an amount that reflect the consideration where CA Sri Lanka expects to provide
services to its stakeholders. The Institute has adopted SLFRS 15 using the full retrospective
method based on the assessment performed and decided that the impact is not material to the
financial statements and therefore adjustment has not been made in the retained earnings opening
balance of the statement of changes in funds and reserves.
In terms of SLFRS 15, Revenue is recognised upon satisfactory performance obligation is
achieved. CA Sri Lanka expects that,the revenue recognition to occur over time where stakeholders
(mainly students and members) simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by
CA Sri Lanka and when the Institute has an enforceable right to receive payment for performance
completed. Otherwise, the revenue of the Institute is recognised at point in time.
Following table provides the details of the sources of revenue and recognition of revenue
