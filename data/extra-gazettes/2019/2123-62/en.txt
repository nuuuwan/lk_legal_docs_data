the management contract in 2008 Chilaw Plantations Ltd., paid a sum of Rs. 124 million to Wayamba Plantations
Ltd.
Both parties have filed written submissions.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to following conclusions.
(i) The 8 Applicants initially were the employees of Janatha Estates Development Board.
(ii) By Gazette Extra Ordinary of  the Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka dated 11.06.1992 Chilaw Plantations
Ltd was incorporated to take over the functions including Contracts of Employment entered into by
the Janatha Estates Development Board b with the employees.
(iii) Mr. K. D. Manoj Priyantha, Commissioner of Labour Relations has ordered to the General Manager of
Chilaw Plantations Ltd., to pay salary increments due to 8 Applicants.
(iv) Whereas the retiring Gratuity of the all the Applicants were paid by the Chilaw Plantations Ltd., who
is the Employer Company and not by the Wayamba Plantations (Pvt) - the Managing Agents.
(v) Whereas the Gazette Extra Ordinary of the Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka dated 11.06.1992 will
prevail in respect of the Contract of Employment of the Applicants.
(vi) The Chilaw Plantations Ltd. has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the applicant by denying them
the salary revision granted to them by Public Adminitration Circular dated 15.01.1997.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the
contract o employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect of the award
is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator creates a new
contract for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract. An industrial
arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employement to come into force in the future when he cannot get the
parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the Respondent Company (party of the second part) has caused injustice
to the applicant. (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the
First part be paid Salary Arrears due to the Party of the Second Part as per the Public Administration Circular dated 15.01.1997
on their respective retirement date as follows.
