NATIONAL   ENVIRONMENTAL    ACT   No.   47   OF   1980
REGULATIONS made by the President under Section 32 of the National Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980, read with
Sections 23J, 23K and 23L of that Act and Section 51 of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

REGULATIONS
1. These Regulations may be cited as the National Environmental (Stationary Sources Emission Control)
Regulations, No. 01 of  2019.
2. Any person who manages or is in control off any stationary source specified in Schedule I hereto which
emanates stack emissions, shall construct such stationary source in conformity with the standards specified in Schedule
II hereto.

3. All emissions from stationary sources which are not specified in Schedule I, shall comply with the standards
specified in Part I and II of Schedule III hereto.
4. All fugitive emissions emanating from any industrial process shall be measured and controlled according to
the methods and standards specified in Schedules IV , V , VI and VII hereto.
5. The methods approved by the Central Environmental Authority (hereinafter referred to as the “Authority”)
shall be used in the measurement of emissions.
6. The concentration of any stationary source emission measured shall be converted into dry condition. The
following equation shall be used for such conversion :-
7. The stationary source emission concentration converted into dry condition under Regulation 6, shall be
converted into standard condition. The following equation shall be used for such conversion :-
where C n = Emission concentration at standard conditions
Cs = Converted dry emission concentration
Pn = Standard pressure 760 mmHg
Ps = Stack pressure in mmHg
Tn = Standard temperature 273 Kelvin
Ts = Stack temperature in Kelvin
8. The stationary source emission concentration converted into standard condition under Regulation 7 shall be
converted for relevant reference oxygen level specified in Schedule VIII hereto. The following equation shall be used for
such conversion :-
where
Er = Emission concentration at fuel specific reference oxygen percentage
Em = Standardized emission concentration
O2 % ref = Reference Oxygen percentrage of fuel type specified in Schedule VIII
O2 % m = Measured volume percentage of oxygen level on dry basis.
9. Where the fuel type is not specified in Schedule VIII, the reference oxygen level shall be six percent (6%) :
Provided that, where there  is a mixed-fuel usage, the major fuel type based on energy input shall be considered. Reference
oxygen level shall be ten percent (10%) for incinerators.
10. In the case of multi-fuel usage, for each fuel, the standards specified in Schedule II hereto shall be applied.
DRY  GAS  CONCENTRATION  =
MEASURED  CONCENTRATION
[100 - (MOISTURE   PERCENTAGE)]

11. Minimum stack height of any combustion point source shall be determined by the following equation.
where H = The height in meters of the tallest building within 5U radius of the point source.
C = Minimum stack height in meters.
U = Uncorrected stack height in meters.
U shall be determined by following equation.
where Q = Gross heat imput in Mega Watt (MW)
(i) This rule shall be applied for the combustion source with gross heat input greater than 0.620MW.
(ii) In any case, stack height shall not be less than 20 meters except for the combustion sources with gross heat
input less than 0.620 MW.
12. In relation to thermal power plants and to any other combustion source, air pollution caused by Sulfur Dioxide
(SO2) emission shall be controlled by fuel quality, stack height or Sulfur Dioxide emission control devices to maintain the
existing embient air quality standards. Minimum stack height shall be determinded by accepted air quality modelling
software. In the absence of such modelling software, with the approval of the Authority, following equation shall be
applied to determine the minimum stack height in meters.
Minimum stack height
Where Q is Sulfur Dioxide (SO
2) emission rate kg/hour.
13. Emissions from Crematoriums shall be controlled by emission reduction devices incorporated into the stack
of the crematorium.
14. Dioxin and Furan emissions form incinerators shall be controlled by maintaining temperature between
10000 C to 1250 0 C and 2-3 seconds retention time in secondary chamber.
15. No person shall emit or discharge any pollutant to atmosphere exceeding the pollutant based emision limits
specified in Schedule III hereto.
16. Any person who fails to comply with the above regulations, shall be liable to an offence under the National
Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980.
C (m)  = H(m) + 0.6U (m)
U (m)  = 1.36Q 0.6
H (m)  = 14Q 0.25

b. The wind direction shall be the most predominant wind direction during the time period of measurement.
c. Any method approved by the Authority shall be used for the TSPM measurement.
(Regulation 4)
SCHEDULE V

a. The measurement location shall be within 5 meters from any process equipment or emission area towards
up - wind and down - wind directions.
b. The wind direction shall be the most predominant wind direction the time period of measurement.
c. Any method approved by the Authority shall be used for the determination of Non-Methane V olatile Organic
Compounds.
