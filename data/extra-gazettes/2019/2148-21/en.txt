“SILENT PERIOD” in regard to Election Propaganda is the period commencing forty-eight hours before the date fixed for the
poll and ending with the declaration of the result. Publicity should not be given to promote or prejudice any political party or
candidate by way of propaganda or advertisement during this period.
However, reports of public meetings held on the day prior to the silent period to promote political parties or
candidates can be broadcast and telecast only once on radio and television channels in their news bulletins on the following
day, giving equal time periods for contesting parties or candidates. In print media, such news about the final public meetings
should be published only on the day that follows the meeting, without giving any special favour to any party or candidate.
