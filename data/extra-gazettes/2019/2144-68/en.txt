Manual 
7.6
Only the bids/proposals marked “original” shall be evaluated by the bec/Pc.
7.7 Purpose and Stages of bid/Proposal Evaluation refer 
Manual 
7.7
a) the purpose of bid/proposal evaluation is to determine the substantially responsive lowest 
evaluated bid/proposal out of the bids/proposals received.
b) bid/proposal evaluation process could be divided into four broad stages: 
Stage One: Collection of Data and Information and Prepare for bid/Proposal Evaluation:
begin with collection of information and preliminary examination of bids; 
a) basic data collection;
b) record of bid/proposal opening and related information collection;
c) examination for completeness of bids/proposals; and
d) preparation of table of bidder’s completeness. 
Stage Two: Examination of bids/Proposal for Substantial Responsiveness 
a) examination of substantial responsiveness to commercial requirements.
b) the bids/proposals that are responsive to commercial requirements will be examined for 
responsiveness to technical requirements.
c) when examining the responsiveness to both commercial and technical requirements due 
recognition will be given for deviations. 
d) preparation of a table of responsiveness to commercial, technical requirements and deviations. 
Stage Three: Detailed bid/Proposal Evaluation: 
At this stage detailed bid/proposal evaluation will be carried out in accordance with the Procurement 
Document,	to	determine	the	substantially	responsive	bids/proposals	after	which	the	financial	
evaluation should be carried out.
If the Procurement documents provide provision for application of domestic preference, will be 
carried out.
At the end of this evaluation stage, a table of substantially responsive evaluated bids/proposals will 
be prepared.
Stage four: Determination of the Lowest Evaluated Substantially Responsive bid/Proposal:
Step one is examination of unbalanced bids/proposals in the civil Works contracts; 
Step	two	is	examination	of	post	qualification	criteria;	and
Step three is examination of alternative bids/proposals if there is provision in the Procurement 
documents. 
Finally, selection and recommendation of substantially responsive lowest evaluated bid/proposal.
bid/proposal evaluation process ends up with preparation of bid evaluation report and 
recommendation for the award of contract.

7.8  Domestic Preference refer 
Manual
7.8
domestic preference is applied in international and national competitive bidding, when locally 
manufactured	articles	that	confirm	local	value	addition	as	specified	in	the	Manual	are	offered	
in	competition	with	imported	articles	or	with	articles	that	specified	local	value	addition	is	not	
confirmed	and	when	local	contractors	are	competing	with	foreign	contractors,	with	a	view	to	
promoting national manufacturing and construction industries respectively. 
the bidders offering locally manufactured articles in the case of Goods and domestic bidders in 
the case of Works shall be considered for domestic preference during the bid evaluation according 
to the criteria referred in the Manual.  
7.9 Clarifications from Bidders
during the evaluation of bids/proposals (particularly for complex works) there may be a need 
to	seek	clarification	from	a	bidder	with	the	sole	purpose	of	ensuring	better	understanding	of	the	
bid/proposal as submitted so that the bid/proposal can be properly and fairly evaluated. these 
clarifications	should	not:
a) permit any substantive change to the bidder’s initial response; or
b) change the bid/proposal price, except correction of arithmetical errors in the pricing of the 
bid; or
c)	 give	an	advantage	to	the	bidder	from	whom	clarification	is	sought	by	providing	that	
clarification;
On a request by Pc or the bec with the approval or delegated authority of Pc, the Pe will seek 
such	clarifications	from	the	bidder	in	writing.
In	the	case	of	BEC	requesting	PE	to	seek	clarifications	without	the	approval	of	PC,	such	requests	
shall be made known to the Pc concurrently.
7.10 unrealistic bids/Proposals
When the substantially responsive lowest evaluated bid/proposal appears to be unrealistic, on the 
request	of	BEC,	PE	may	require	the	bidder	to	prove	written	clarification,	including	detailed	price	
analysis to demonstrate the consistency of prices with the scope of works, proposed methodology 
and schedule. After evaluating the detailed price analysis, Pc/bec may as appropriate:
a) accept the bid/proposal; 
b) require that the total value of the performance security be increased, at the expense of the 
bidder; 
c) reject the bid/proposal.

Negotiation shall be carried out by the Pc with the assistance of bec.
Negotiation may be resorted to only in the following circumstances, with the lowest evaluated 
responsive bidder; 
(a)	 having	potential	to	improve	outcome	and	benefits	and	reduce	uncertainties;	or	
(b) when only one bid/proposal is received after wide publicity has been given and prices 
quoted by the single bidder is high, the price also may be negotiated.
the Pc shall keep a record of matters agreed with the bidder during negotiations and the Pe 
shall execute a Memorandum of understanding (MOu) with the bidder relating to the agreed 
negotiated terms and conditions and this MOu should be included in the contract agreement.

as:
a) lack of competition;
b) bids/proposals are not substantially responsive;
c) when bid/proposal prices are substantially higher than the existing budget.
However, 
 i. lack of competition shall not be determined solely on the number of bids/proposals 
received.
 ii. even when only one bid/proposal is received, after wide publicity has been given, the 
bidding process may still be considered valid, if the prices quoted are reasonable. 
7.14 Re invitation of bids/Proposals
a) Wider publicity must be given when re-inviting bids/proposals. 
b) In re-inviting bids/proposals, the same Procurement documents shall not be used without 
rectifying	possible	deficiencies	in	the	Procurement	Document.

 fRAmEwORk AGREEmENT
12.1 Introduction
the Framework Agreement is an arrangement to enable timely supply of Goods, Works, Services 
and Information Systems, which are commonly used by Procuring entities to procure Goods, 
Works,	Services	and	Information	Systems	which	have	national	significance,	in	desired	quality	
and at prices attributable to economies of scale resulting from bulk purchases ensuring value for 
money.
A central Procurement entity or Procuring entity on its own and on behalf of other Procuring 
entities may administer Framework Procurements and enters in to Framework Agreements with 
suppliers so that Procuring entities may obtain value for money in their purchasing while being 
assured that their procurement is compliant with the procurement Guidelines. 
FWAs may be established for the anticipated procurement of Goods, Works, Services and 
Information	Systems,	as	and	when	required,	over	a	specified	period	of	time.	FWA	does	not	
commit	either	party	to	procure	or	supply.	Once	established,	a	FWA	provides	a	fast	and	efficient	
way to procure Goods, Works or Services. 
A	multi-	supplier	FWA	allows	a	PE	to	select	from	a	number	of	firms,	helping	to	ensure	that	each

 e-GOvERNmENT PROCuREmENT (e-GP)
13.1 Introduction
An e-GP is a process that uses the Internet and Internet tools to support every stage of the 
Procurement Process.
the conversion from conventional (paper based) government procurement activities to e-GP is 
becoming an international trend in many countries in the World. GOSL is in the process of getting 
ready to implement e-GP in the country for Goods, Works, Services, Information Systems and 
consultancy Services. However, there are major issues and challenges that need to be addressed 
before the implementation of fully pledged e-GP system. 
An	e-Government	Procurement	(e-GP)	is	defined	as	the	collaborative	use	of	information	and	
communications technologies by Government entities, bidding community, regulatory agencies, 
legal authorities, National Procurement commission, Ministry of Finance, other supporting 
service providers, and civil society in conducting ethical procurement activities of the Government 
procurement process cycle for the procurement of Goods, Works, Services, Information Systems, 
consultancy Services and management of contracts ensuring good governance and value-for-
money in public procurement, and contributing to the socio economic development of country.
13.2 Implementation Process of e-GP at the PEs refer 
Manual
13.2
All	stages	of	procurement	cycle	of	the	PEs	can	benefit	from	an	e-GP	such	as	procurement	planning,	
pre-qualification,	 advertising,	 PPP	 advertisements,	 preparation	 and	 issuance	 of	 Procurement	
documents, pre-bid conference, and issuing pre-bid meetings minutes, issuing addendums, 
modifications	and	revising	Procurement	Documents,	clarifications,	modification	and	addendas,	
receipt of bids/proposals, unsolicited proposals, bid/proposal closing, bid/proposal opening, 
evaluation	of	 bids/proposals,	 request	 for	 clarifications,	 and	 contract	 award	 notification,	 and	
publication of contract award results.
13.3 Fully fledged e-GP system to be implemented by the PEs
Pes may use an e-GP for all of their procurement activities provided the appropriate authority is 
satisfied	with	the	adequacy	and	competence	of	the	system,	including;
•	 accessibility
•	 security	of	process
•	 authentication
•	 integrity
•	 confidentiality
•	 reliability
•	 audit	trial	features
•	 electronic	signatures
•	 design	and	implement	an	e-GP	management	system
•	 identification	of	requirements
•	 legal	obligations/	Acts/	agreements/legislative	approaches,	and	other	mandatory	
       requirements for e-GP implementation.

13.4 Good Governance in Public Procurement: key to e-GP
the procurement principles and objectives, particularly transparency and non-discrimination must 
be met if e-GP systems are to be applied to the activities of Public Procurement similar to paper-
based procurement.
the principle of non-discrimination between paper-based and e-procurement shall, as far as 
practical,	be	reflected	in	the	e-GP	system.	PE	shall	have	in	place	the	transitional	option	of	paper-
based procurement for bidders/consultants who wish it or who do not have access to e-GP. the 
e-GP system must be designed to ensure;
•		accountability
•	 efficiency	and	effectiveness
•	 fraud	and	corruption	control
•	 equity	and	ethics
•	 rule	of	law	and	predictability
•	 civil	society	awareness
•	 equality	of	access	and	fairness,
•	 open	competition,
•	 security	of	process
the following requirements are designed to support these principles for Pes procurement activities. 
converting these principles into operational effect has implications for variables such as;
•	 technological	neutrality,
•	 technical	standards	for	interoperability	and	security,
•	 ensuring	good	audit	trails,
•	 cost	and	ease	of	participation.
these requirements supplement and do not replace existing requirements that apply to traditional 
procurement	procedures	specified	in	the	Procurement	Guidelines	&	Manuals	published	by	the	
NPc.
13.5 e-GP System Access refer 
Manual
13.5
When e-GP is to be applied to Pe’s procurement activities, it shall have the minimum features 
specified	in	the	Procurement	Manual.
NPc encourage individual Pes to use e-GP depending on the availability of resources that must 
be met. When e-GP is implemented by Pes, they shall follow the mandatory requirements and 
processes	specified	in	the	Procurement	Guidelines	issued	for	traditional	paper-based	procurement	
by NPc if it is not provided in this Guidelines and Manuals.

OPEN CONTRACTING DATA STANDARD (OCDS)
14.1 Introduction refer 
Manual
14.1
the Open contracting data Standard (OcdS) is a core product of the Open contracting Partnership 
(OcP). the objective of the data standard is to support Governments to publish contracting data 
in a more accessible, inter-operable and useful manner and to enable the widest possible range of 
stakeholders to use contracting data effectively.
the Guidelines describe the OcdS presents a high-level approach for each implementation in 
an	e-Procurement	system.	If	the	OCDS	is	implemented	in	an	e-Procurement	system	when	first	
introduced	by	incorporating	OCDS	within	the	system	itself,	the	system	specification	phase	must	
explicitly	define	OCDS-specific	requirements	(e.g.	data	fields,	triggers,	reports,	visualizer).
By	adopting	the	OCDS	into	the	contracting	process,	the	expected	benefits	are	important	for	key	
stakeholders. the users may use open contracting data in order to:
a) achieve value for money;
b) provide the potential to increase trust and transparency with the public, for the 
Government;
c) strengthen the transparency, accountability and integrity of public contracting;
d) access and review details of public contracting processes and monitor spending to ensure 
that citizens are getting the best outcomes, for the non-governmental organizations;
e) enable the private sector to compete for public contracts;
f) monitor service delivery (from both aid and budget-executed projects) for effectiveness;
g) get involved in decision making, for the general public;
h) reduce opportunities for fraudulent or corrupt use of public resources.
the publication of data could be organized in the following manner;
i.   proactive publication requirement;
ii.   timing and frequency of publication;
iii.  formats and licences of publication;
iv.  procurements and contracts;
v.  stakeholder engagement.
14.2 Standard refer 
Manual
14.2
The	OCDS	is	used	to	describe	unique	contracting	processes.	The	first	step	towards	publishing	open	
contracting data is to identify the contracting processes in the system data. A contracting process 
ties together information about the different stages related to the lifespan of a contract, beginning 
with planning and progressing through initiation and implementation stages accordingly, as well 
as ending when a contract is either completed or closed.
Note :    NPC will issue an Operational manual with the concurrence of the relevant institutions enabling 
adoption of the provisions of the Chapter.

Green Public Procurement (GPP) is a Public Procurement, which integrates environmental 
considerations in the whole Public Procurement process including planning and procurement and 
takes into the consideration the entire life cycle of the goods, works or service. In addition, it is 
considered to be appropriate and one of the most effective tools seeking to reduce negative impacts 
on the environment.
15.1.1 Green Public Procurement Policy
refer 
Manual
15.1.1
Sri Lanka Government has taken a policy decision to adopt green procurement practice 
as a mandatory requirement and to include basic premises in the new Procurement 
Guidelines.
Green procurement means procuring Goods, Works and Services that cause minimal 
adverse environmental impacts. the procurement procedure itself includes human 
health and environmental concerns and those safeguard measures which are to be 
included	in	the	tender	documents.	Specifically,	Government	Institutions	are	encouraged	
to avoid single use disposable items and purchase products, works and services and 
efforts to be given to the following points;
a) with improved recyclability, high recycle contents,reduce packing and 
greater durability and where ever possible using green material;
b)	 with	greater	energy	efficiency;
c) utilizing clean technology and or clean fuel;
d) which result in reduced water consumption, and increase water harvesting;
e) which emit fewer irritating or toxic substances during installation or use;
f) which result in smaller production of toxic substances or of less toxic 
substance upon disposal and sustainable garbage disposal;
g) apply where ever possible; the polluter pays principle and the producer 
responsibility.

e)	 first	starting	strategy	of	GPP	is	to	begin	with	commonly	use	Goods,	Works	and	Services	
and to expand the green procurement list;
f)	 encourage	in	getting	green	building	or	green	material	certification.
15.4 Role play by the ministry of Environment refer 
Manual
15.4
the Ministry in charge of the subject of environment shall establish an Inter-Agency expert 
committee on Green Public Procurement. (IAec- GPP). 
15.5 Introducing Green Specifications for Commonly Used Items refer 
Manual
15.5
IAEC	may	develop	green	specifications	for	commonly	used	products,	Goods	and	Works	using	
existing	certified	material	by	local	green	certification	organizations.		Each	PE	shall	obtain	approval	
for	their	green	specifications	from	IAEC.
15.6 Inclusion of Green Public Procurement criteria in Procurement Documents refer 
Manual
15.6
For	the	purchase	of	common	use	items,	each	PE	may	be	adopted	green	specifications	as	“mandatory”	
features	in	the	bid/proposal	specifications	when	the	products	are	available	on	the	market	with	
adequate models and quantities in supply. In this connection, “mandatory” green requirements are 
specified	in	the	Manual.
For	new	green	specifications	developed	with	uncertain	market	availability,	green	specifications	
will	be	included	in	the	bid/proposal	specifications	as	“desirable”	features.	“Desirable”	green	
requirements	are	also	specified	in	the	Manual.
15.7 Evaluation of bids/Proposals with Green Criteria refer 
Manual
15.7
the bid evaluation committee (bec) will evaluate bids/proposals which can meet the mandatory 
features and recommend either the lowest conforming offer (for a bid/proposal without a marking 
scheme) or the highest scoring conforming offer (for a bid/proposal with a marking scheme) for 
acceptance. As regards the green desirable features, they are not taken into account in the bid/
proposal evaluation except where there are two or lowest conforming offers which are identical 
in	all	respects,	the	one	which	could	meet	the	desirable	green	specification(s)	could	be	given	the	
preference. these arrangements should be clearly spelt out in the Procurement document.

In	order	to	encourage	potential	suppliers	to	offer	products	that	can	comply	with	green	specifications,	
consideration may also be given to adopting a marking scheme with appropriate weighting for 
green	specifications	against	the	price	offered.	For	this	purpose,	prior	approval	has	to	be	obtained	
from the Procurement committee (Pc). In drawing up the marking scheme, due weight should be 
given to whether it will achievethe value for money objective.
BEC	will	keep	record	of	the	bids/proposals	that	can	meet	the	“desirable”	green	specifications	and	
review	the	market	availability	of	products	meeting	individual	green	specifications	on	a	regular	
basis based on the bid/proposal responses and market information, with a view to changing them 
into “mandatory” or “desirable requirements attracting marks” in future bidding exercises when 
circumstances	warrant.	Individual	“desirable”	green	specifications	without	sufficient	models	or	
quantities in supply will continue to be included as “desirable” features.
15.8 Annual Report on Green Product Purchase refer 
Manual
15.8
to monitor the green product purchasing situation, the NPc will invite the Procuring entities to 
submit	a	report	on	its	last	calendar	year’s	purchases	within	the	first	two	months	of	each	calendar	
year. Procuring entities are advised to go through the green product list and check whether the 
products to be purchased are included on the list. If products to be purchased are listed, the 
Procuring	entity	should	try	to	apply	the	recommended	green	specifications	by	making	reference	
to the practice mentioned in paragraphs 15.6 and 15.7 above and include the item code and green 
specification	code	as	recommended	by	the	IAEC	in	the	common	use	item	list.	In	parallel,	the	
Procuring entities should consolidate the information of the product Id, purchase values and the 
information	on	whether	green	specifications	are	adopted	or	not	and	whether	the	final	purchases	
meet	such	green	specifications	for	incorporation	into	the	annual	report	to	NPC.
15.9 Cost Implication
Procuring entities should absorb any additional cost incurred in procuring Goods, Works and 
Services	with	green	specifications.	While	costs	of	these	products	and	services	may	in	some	cases	
be higher than those without green features, it is expected that the Government’s initiative of taking 
the lead on green procurement would facilitate the development of the relevant market and the 
prices	of	products	meeting	green	specifications	would	be	lowered	over	time.
Procuring entities shall prepare life cycle cost in case of procuring Goods with the life over three 
years and it is mandatory in the case of Works.
Note :   NPC will issue an Operational manual with the concurrence of the relevant institutions enabling 
adoption of the provisions of the Chapter.

affiliates or Individual Consultants competing for a consulting assignment do not derive 
a competitive advantage from having provided Consulting Services related to it. To that 
end, the PE shall make available to all the short-listed Consultants, together with the 
request for proposals, all information that would in that respect give a Consultant a 
competitive advantage.
Officials shall refrain from compromising the Code of Ethics by accepting inappropriate

CHAPTER 3
SELECTION PROCESS AND SELECTION METHODS OF CONSULTANCY FIRMS AND 
INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANTS
The selection method shall achieve the objectives of VfM, fairness, clarity, fit-for-purpose, transparency 
and confidentiality. Hence the appropriate method of selection is related to the nature, size, complexity, 
likely impact of the assignment, and the technical and financial considerations.
A consultancy firm shall be selected in obtaining the services required rather than getting the service 
done by one or more individuals for assignments for which: 
a. coordinated input of team of personnel with different expertise are required; and
b. coordination, administration or collective responsibility is important.
In other cases, PE may select Individual Consultant (IC). The selection method of Individual Consultant 
is outlined in section 3.2 below.
3.1 Methods for the Selection of Consultancy Firm Refer 
Manual
3.1
The choice of the appropriate method of selection is related to the factors mentioned above. It is 
therefore necessary to carefully define the assignment, particularly the Terms of Reference (TOR) 
including objective and the scope of the services, before deciding on the selection method.
The following selection methods shall be determined as appropriate by the PE prior to issuance of 
the request for proposals from prospective Consultants.
a) Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS);
b) Quality Based Selection (QBS);
c) Fixed Budget Selection (FBS);
d) Least Cost Selection (LCS);
e) Consultant’s Qualifications based Selection (CQS);
f) Direct Selection-Single Source Selection (SSS); and
g) Selection of Particular Types of Consultants

20A
3.1.1 Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) Refer 
Manual
3.1.1
QCBS is a competitive process among shortlisted consulting firms under which the 
selection of the successful firm takes into account the quality of the proposal and the 
cost of the services. The request for proposals document shall specify the minimum 
score for the technical proposals. The relative weight to be given to the quality and cost 
depends on the nature of the assignment.Weightage for quality part of the proposal is 
always higher than the financial part. Among the proposals that are responsive to the 
requirements of the request for proposals document and are technically qualified, the 
proposal with the highest combined (quality and cost) score is considered the Most 
Advantageous Proposal.
Preferred method of selection of consultancy firm shall be QCBS. Other methods shall 
be used only under the circumstances described against such selection methods.
The QCBS method is appropriate when: 
a)  the scope of work can be precisely defined;
b)   the TOR are well specified and clear; and,
c) PE and the Consultants can estimate with reasonable accuracy the personnel 
time as well as the other inputs required of the Consultants.
3.1.2 Quality Based Selection (QBS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.2
QBS is a method based on evaluating only the quality of the technical proposals and 
the subsequent negotiation of the financial proposal and the contract award to the 
consultancy firm who submitted the highest ranked technical proposal.
When QBS is used, the proposal quality is evaluated without using cost as an evaluation 
criterion. The RFP will request firms to submit both technical and financial proposals 
at the same time, but in separate envelops (single stage – two envelope system). The 
financial proposal of only the highest technically qualified firm is open and evaluated. 
The Procuring Entity and the related firm shall discuss the work plan, the TOR, and 
financial proposal, etc. of the contract. After successful completion of technical and 
financial negotiations with the highest ranked firm, the contract will be awarded. The 
rest of financial proposals will be returned unopened to the unsuccessful firms. QBS is 
appropriate for the following types of assignments:
a) complex or highly specialized assignments for which it is difficult to define 
precise TOR and the input required from the firm, and for which the Procuring 
Entity expects the firm to demonstrate innovation in its Proposals;
b) assignments that have a high downstream impact; and
c) assignments that can be carried out in substantially different ways, so that 
Proposals will not be comparable.

21A
3.1.3 Fixed Budget- based Selection (FBS) Refer 
Manual
3.1.3
Like QCBS, FBS is a competitive process among shortlisted consulting firms under 
which the selection of the successful firm takes into account the quality of the Proposal 
and the cost of the services. In the request for proposals document, the cost of services 
is specified as a fixed budget that shall not be exceeded.
FBS is appropriate when:
a) the type of Consultancy Service required is simple and TOR can be precisely 
defined;
b) the time and personnel inputs can be accurately assessed to ensure the budget is 
reasonably estimated and set;
c) the budget is sufficient for the firm to perform the assignment. 
d) the budget is fixed and cannot be exceeded.
Evaluation of all technical proposals shall be carried out first. The firms securing less 
than the minimum marks shall be rejected, and the financial proposals of the rest shall 
be opened in public.
Proposals of which evaluated financial proposal exceed the indicated fixed budget shall 
be rejected. 
The technical proposal with the highest technical score that meets the fixed budget 
requirement, be selected and invited to finalize the contract.
3.1.4 Least Cost Selection (LCS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.4
Similar to QCBS, LCS is a competitive process among shortlisted consulting firms 
under which the selection of the successful firm takes into account the quality of the 
Proposal and the cost of the services. 
LCS is generally appropriate for selecting Consultants for smaller value assignments, 
of a standard or routine nature where well–established practices and standards exist. 
The RFP shall define the “minimum” qualifying mark for the “quality” and request the 
firms to submit at the same time technical and financial proposals in separate envelopes. 
Technical proposals will be opened first and evaluated. Those securing less than the 
minimum qualifying mark specified in the RFP will be rejected, and the financial 
proposals of the rest will be opened in public. The firm with the lowest evaluated cost 
shall then be selected and invited to finalize the contract.

3.1.5 Consultant’s Qualification-based Selection (CQS) Refer 
Manual
3.1.5
CQS is appropriate for;
a) smaller value assignments; or
b) an emergency situation; and
c) preparation and evaluation of full-fledged competitive proposals is not justified.
CQS is appropriate for higher value assignments only when:
d) satisfies the condition given under ‘c’ above; and
e) highly specialized expertise is required for the assignment: and
f) few Consultants are qualified.
The PE shall Request Expressions of Interest (REOI), by attaching the TOR to the REOI. 
Only a selected consultancy firms shall be requested to provide information about their 
relevant experience and qualifications. Out of the long list received in response to the 
REOI, a shortlist of minimum of three firms shall be prepared and the PE will select 
the firm with the best qualifications and relevant experience and invite it to submit its 
combined technical and financial proposals for negotiations.
Should the negotiations failed the PE shall obtain a combined proposal from the next 
ranked firm until an agreement is reached.
Advertisement of REOI is not mandatory.
3.1.6 Direct Selection - Single Source Selection (SSS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.6
Generally, Single Source Selection of consultancy firms does not provide the benefits 
of competition in regard to quality and cost, lacks transparency in selection, and could 
encourage unacceptable practices. Therefore, single source selection shall only be used 
in exceptional cases.
While going through this method of selection, the PE will provide well described and 
evidence based justifications to ensure economies of scales, efficiency and value for 
money. The justifications shall be examined at an appropriate level for making the 
decision.
SSS will be used only in exceptional cases, where it provides clear advantage over 
competition in the following cases;

<!-- page 87 -->

23A
SSS may be appropriate under the following circumstances:
a) an existing contract for Consulting Services, may be extended for additional 
Consulting Services of a similar nature, if it is properly justified; no advantage 
may be obtained by competition; and the prices are reasonable. Extended 
services shall not be more than 25% of the existing contract; or
b) for Consulting Services which are natural continuation of previous assignment 
carried out by the same firm within the last 12 months, where it was selected 
on competitive basis for the first assignment and where continuity of technical 
services is unavoidable and if performance has been satisfactory in the previous 
assignment(s). Extended continuation services shall not be more than 50% of 
the previous assignment;
c) in cases of an emergency situation where a rapid selection is essential;
d) for smaller value assignments;
e) when only one firm is qualified, or has experience of exceptional worth for the 
assignment; 
Specific recommendation shall be obtained from the relevant CPC.
For Foreign Funded Projects this selection method shall be used only with the prior 
approval of the relevant funding agency;
In all instances of direct selection, the Procuring Entity shall ensure fairness and equity, 
and shall have in place procedures to ensure that:
i)  the prices are reasonable and consistent with the market rates for services of a 
similar nature; and
ii)  the required Consulting Services are not split into smaller- size procurements to 
avoid competitive processes.
iii)   to obtain necessary prior approval for the SSS justification with all other relevant 
details In Writing from the CAO, concerned on recommendation by a CSC.

3.1.7.1 Consultancy Works by State Universities and State Research & Development 
(R&D) Centers
With the objective of promoting active institute/industry links/partnerships, research 
based consultancy assignments directed towards improvements of efficiency and 
productivity of the local industries and helping to realize the country’s socio-economic, 
environmental, human development policies, may be directly assigned to state 
universities and state R&D centers. In such situations, PE shall follow the process 
using direct selection method. The fees billed for permanent staff by the university 
or R&D center in no case should exceed twice the basic salary of such staff. When 
such Consulting Services are given, the university or R&D center shall follow the 
requirements given in the Consultant’s Manual. PE shall ensure that the relevant 
permanent staff of the university or R&D center is under the control and direction of 
the university authorities, have necessary legal and administrative clearances to engage 
in consultancy assignments, and ensure that the assignments given under this section 
are not subcontracted, assigned or otherwise transferred to any person or entity outside 
the university.
The contract shall be entered with the proper legal entity of the university or R&D 
center and in no case with an individual or group of individual. 
For Foreign Funded Projects this selection method shall be used only with the 
concurrence with the Foreign Funding Agency.

assignment. The scope of the services described in the TOR shall be compatible 
with the available budget. TOR shall define clearly the objectives, specific tasks 
required to implement the assignment, goals, and scope of the assignment and 
provide background information (including a list of existing relevant studies and 
basic data), and provides details on the required qualifications of the key experts; 
and lists the expected deliverables to facilitate the Consultants’ preparation of 
their proposals. If transfer of knowledge or training is an objective, it should be 
specifically outlined along with details of number of staff to be trained, and so 
forth, to enable Consultants to estimate the required resources.

  However, TOR should not be too detailed and inflexible, so that competing 
Consultants may propose their own methodology and staffing. Consultancy firms 
shall be encouraged to comment on the TOR in their proposals. The PE’s and 
Consultants’ respective responsibilities should be clearly defined in the TOR.
b) TOR should provide a level playing field for all prospective Consultants. It should

the cost. The evaluation shall be carried out in full conformity with the provisions of the 
RFP. The purpose of proposal evaluation will vary with the selection method used.
b) Precise evaluation procedures vary between the different methodologies, but all consist of 
three stages:
 i. a preliminary screening to eliminate proposals which do not comply with the 
basic requirements of the RFP and the firm does not meet mandatory eligibility 
requirements;

the RFP document, to assess the relative quality of the proposals, using a merit point 
scoring system specified in the RFPand to determine which proposals should proceed 
to the financial opening and evaluation; and
 iii. a financial evaluation to examine the prices of the proposal/s and determine which 
is the successful proposal that should be recommended for award of contract.

7.8 Evaluation of Technical Proposal Refer 
Manual
7.8
7.8.1 CSC to agree on the Rating System in Advance
All members of the CSC should familiarize themselves with the RFP (in particular 
the TOR), the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria specified in the data sheet, and the 
selection procedure. The CSC should meet before the deadline for submission of the 
proposals to confirm that there is a common understanding of the evaluation method, 
the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria, and a joint definition of the rating system. It is 
important not to wait until after the technical proposals are opened to define the rating 
system, since these definitions could be biased by the knowledge of the contents of 
the proposals.
7.8.2 Evaluation to be Carried out by CSC
Evaluation shall be carried out by each CSC member other than the chairperson, 
individually. The CSC first reviews each proposal to confirm that it is substantially 
responsive, that is, that there are no important/material omissions or deviations from 
the stated objectives, TOR, or other key requirements of the RFP. Individual’s results 
shall be recorded on pre-formulate worksheets or web-forms templates. By applying 
the criteria and sub-criteria specified in the RFP, CSC shall establish the absolute, not 
the relative, quality of the proposals.
After each member has independently completed the evaluation, the CSC should meet 
to review, and if necessary discuss the merits of, individual evaluations and scores. 
Some evaluators tend to be generous while others will be rigid in their judgment and 
ratings. Such disparity does not matter, provided each evaluator is consistent and 
differences in scores are not too large. The chairperson of the CSC shall review the 
large differences and discuss with the members at a joint meeting, since they often 
are caused by improper or inaccurate use of the rating system. As a result of these 
discussions, a member may revise some of his or her ratings and scores if necessary; 
these changes should be recorded. For each proposal, the CSC should then calculate 
the average of the scores allocated by all members under each criterion, establish the 
technical ranking of the proposals, and identify the best. The evaluation report must 
include the joint as well as the individual evaluations.
7.8.3 Strengths and Weaknesses of Each Proposal to be Recorded
During the evaluation the committee also should comment on the strengths and 
weaknesses of all proposals that have passed the minimum technical qualifying mark 
indicated in the RFP. This will help identify any issues in the recommended proposal 
that need to be clarified during negotiations.

45A
7.8.4 Evaluation Based on Disclosed Criteria
The evaluation shall be based on the evaluation criteria defined in the RFP. The CSC 
shall evaluate each technical proposal, taking into account several criteria including:
 i. the Consultant’s relevant experience for the assignment;
 ii. the quality of the methodology proposed;
 iii. the qualifications and experience of the key staff proposed;
 iv. Other matters, such as the extent of participation of nationals among key 
staff in situations where the shortlist comprises of national and international 
firms and transfer of knowledge for assignments where training is needed.
7.9 Technical Proposal Evaluation Form
Immediately after the evaluation of technical proposal is completed a Technical Evaluation Report 
shall be prepared by CSC in the format as published by NPC recording and explaining the scores 
given to each proposal. For each proposal, the report also should indicate technical weaknesses 
or deviations from the terms set out in the RFP and comment on their acceptability or alternative 
proposed by the Consultants, and comment on their acceptability. The technical evaluation report 
is a confidential document and its contents shall not be disclosed, except to the extent as required 
under the provisions of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of  2016. 
7.10 Clarifications from Consultants During Evaluation
During the evaluation, CSC may request clarification or additional information from the 
Consultants through the PE. However, CSC may not seek clarifications or additional information 
from the Consultants that could change the substance of the proposal.
7.11 Opening of Financial Proposals
After preparing the technical evaluation report, the PE shall notify the Consultants whose 
proposals did not meet the minimum technical score specified in the RFP or were found to be 
non responsive, indicating that the Consultants’ financial proposals will be returned unopened 
at the end of the selection process. The PE simultaneously notifies Consultants whose technical 
proposals were above the minimum technical score and informs them of the date, time, and place 
set for opening the financial envelopes. The opening date should be defined to allow sufficient 
time for Consultants to make arrangements to attend the opening.

46A
The Proposal Opening Committee (POC) verifies that the financial proposals have remained 
sealed and then opens them. The financial proposals of technically qualified firms will be opened 
publicly in the presence of firms or their representatives who choose to attend. The name of the 
Consultant, the technical points, and the proposed prices shall be read aloud and recorded as each 
financial proposal is opened.
When e-GP submission of proposals is used, this information shall be posted online. No modification 
to financial proposals is permitted. The PE prepares the minutes of the public opening, which 
should be attached to the Financial Evaluation Report.
If Consultants were initially requested to submit financial proposals under QBS, the PE shall 
notify the Consultant with the highest-ranked technical proposal and indicates the date, time, and 
place set for negotiating the financial proposal and the contract.
7.12 Evaluation of Financial Proposals Refer 
Manual
7.12
The CSC should first establish that the financial proposals are completed (i.e. whether they have 
priced all the items of the corresponding technical proposal. If not the CSC shall cost them and add 
those costs to the initial price if Time Based type contract is used).
Then the proposals are checked for arithmetical errors. Arithmetical errors should be corrected, 
and the corresponding adjustments made to the offered prices to obtain the final evaluated prices. 
In case of e-GP system, a separate checking of arithmetic errors need not be effected if the price 
of each item is automatically calculated by the system using the rates given by the Consultants 
against the requirements provided by PE.
Activities and items described in the technical proposals, but not priced, shall be assumed to be 
included in the prices of other activities oritems.
If an activity or line item is quantified differently in the financial proposal than in the technical 
proposal and the Time-Based Form of Contract has been included in the RFP, the CSC shall 
correct the quantification indicated in the financial proposal so as to make it consistent with what is 
indicated in the technical proposal, apply the relevant unit price included in the financial proposal 
to the corrected quantity,and correct the total proposal cost. In case of e-GP system, the system 
should be geared for automatic calculation.
If the Lump-Sum Form of Contract has been included in the RFP, no corrections are applied to the 
financial proposal in this respect.

47A
For the purpose of comparing proposals, evaluated prices shall be converted to a single currency 
using the exchange rate, date and source indicated in the RFP where appropriate.
When FBS is adopted, adjustments made by the CSC to correct omissions or in- consistencies 
detected during the evaluation of the financial proposal could raise the evaluated price of a proposal 
over the available budget indicated in the RFP. This could lead to the rejection of the proposal.
7.13  Negotiation with the Highest Ranked Consultant Refer 
Manual
7.13
The objective of negotiations is to arrive at a mutually satisfactory contract between the PE and 
the selected Consultants. The parties will discuss the technical proposal submitted, agree on 
the detailed scope of work of the consultant assignment and all related arrangements, negotiate 
financial terms, and discuss and finalize contract conditions. A good contract should protect the 
interests of both parties in a balanced way.
7.13.1 Negotiation in case of QCBS, FBS and LCS
After completion of the evaluation, the CSC shall negotiate a contract with the first 
ranked consultancy firm. Negotiations shall include discussions of the TOR, the 
methodology, work plan, deliverables, staff schedule, PE’s counterpart facilities, and 
special conditions of the contract. These discussions shall not substantially alter the 
original TOR attached to the invitation. The final TOR and the agreed methodology 
shall be incorporated in “Description of Services” (DOS), which shall form part of 
the contract.
The selected consultancy firm should not be allowed to substitute key staff, unless 
both parties agree that undue delay in the selection process makes such substitution 
unavoidable or that such changes are critical to meet the objectives of the assignment. 
If this is not the case and if it is established that key staff were offered in the Proposal 
without consulting their availability, (as far as possible to avoid such situations 
Consultants can have an written agreement with the key staff on their availability for 
the particular assignment before submitting their names) the consultancy firm may be 
disqualified and the process continued with the next ranked consultancy firm. The key 
staff proposed for substitution shall have qualifications equal to or better than the key 
staff initially proposed.
During the negotiations on financial proposal, unit rates for staff- months and 
reimbursable shall not be negotiated, since these have already been a factor of 
selection in the cost of the proposal, unless there are exceptional reasons.

48A
If the negotiations fail to result in an acceptable contract, the CSC shall terminate 
the negotiations and invite the next ranked consultancy firm for negotiations. The 
Consultant shall be informed of the reasons for termination of the negotiations. Once 
negotiations are commenced with the next ranked consultancy firm, the CSC shall not 
reopen the earlier negotiations. After negotiations are successfully completed with the 
next firm, the CSC shall make their final determination of the contract award. After 
this determination, the PE shall promptly notify other consultancy firms on the short 
list that they were unsuccessful.
7.13.2 Negotiation in Case of QBS, CQS and SSS
After completion of the evaluation the CSC shall negotiate a contract with the 
first ranked Consultant. Negotiations shall include discussions of the TOR, the 
methodology, work plan, deliverables, staff schedule, PE’s counterpart facilities, and 
special conditions of the contract. These discussions shall not substantially alter the 
original TOR attached to the invitation. The final TOR and the agreed methodology 
shall be incorporated in “Description of Services,” which shall form part of the 
contract.
The selected Consultant should not be allowed to substitute key staff, unless both parties 
agree that undue delay in the selection process makes such substitution unavoidable 
or that such changes are critical to meet the objectives of the assignment. If this is 
not the case and if it is established that key staff were offered in the Proposal without 
consulting their availability (as far as possible to avoid such situations Consultants can 
have an agreement with the key staff on their availability for the particular assignment 
before submitting their names), the Consultant may be disqualified, and the process 
continued with the next ranked Consultant. The key staff proposed for substitution 
shall have qualifications equal to or better than the key staff initially proposed.
The negotiations on financial proposal shall include the remuneration rates for staff 
(breakdown of fees such as salary, social costs, overheads, fee that is profit, and any 
premium or allowance paid), proposed unit rates and quantities for reimbursable.
If the negotiations fail to result in an acceptable contract, the CSC shall terminate 
the negotiations and invite the next ranked Consultant for negotiations. The PE 
shall inform the Consultant of the reasons for termination of the negotiations. Once 
negotiations are commenced with the next ranked Consultant, the CPC shall not reopen 
the earlier negotiations. After negotiations are successfully completed, the CSC shall 
make their final determination of the contract award. After this determination, the PE 
shall promptly notify other firms on the short list that they were unsuccessful.
The CSC shall keep a record of matters agreed with the Consultant during negotiations 
and the PE shall execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consultant 
relating to the agreed negotiated terms and conditions, which subsequently shall be 
included as contract terms.

7.14 Combined Evaluation Report Refer 
Manual
7.14
Immediately after the evaluation is completed the CSC should prepare a combined evaluation 
report and recommendation/determination of contract award in the prescribed format and submit 
to the relevant authority for the approval.
7.15 Rejection of all Proposals Received
If all proposals are found to be nonresponsive, the CSC may be justified in rejecting all of them. 
The grounds for rejecting all proposals are as follows:
 i. The proposals present major deficiencies in complying with the RFP.
 ii. All proposals fail to achieve the minimum qualifying mark (technical score) indicated 
in the RFP. 
 iii. The proposal prices are substantially higher than the PE’s estimated budget.
In the first case, there may be technical reasons for the deficiencies. Most frequently, the PE 
and Consultants disagree on which contractual party should be responsible for executing specific 
assignment activities or on the exact content and feasibility of specific deadlines affecting the 
implementation schedule of the PE’s project. In other instances, Consultants may find the estimated 
staff-months and the distribution of risks are unacceptable.
In the third case, the PE may not know the ongoing remuneration levels of Consultants for the 
type of service being considered, Consultants may misinterpret the TOR, or the PE’s plans may be 
too ambitious for the available budget. In this case, before rejecting all proposals, the PE, should 
investigate the feasibility of increasing the budget or scaling down the scope of services to meet 
the original budget.
In all cases, good TOR, accurate budget, and review of the RFP can reduce the risks of nonresponsive 
proposals.
If all proposals rejected, the new process may start and include revising the TOR, RFP (including 
the short list) and the budget. Calling for new proposals creates obvious delays and should remain 
the last resort.
CAO’s prior approval shall be obtained before rejecting all proposals and to start the new process.

PEs spend substantial funds on various type of Consulting Services and therefore need to consider

Three main considerations determine what type of contract to adopt in a Consultancy assignment 
as follows;
a) the nature of the assignment,
b) the distribution of risks and rewards between the Procuring Entity and the Consultant, 
and
c) the circumstances of the PE and of the Consultant. The level of capacity in contract 
management and Consultancy Services supervision that the PE will be able to provide 
may also be a factor in the choice.
The following contract types based on payment conditions may be used as appropriate;
• Lump-sum contract
• Time-based contract
• Retainer and/or (success) fee contract
• Percentage contract
• Indefinite-delivery contract (IDC)
Each type is described briefly in the Manual, as well as the criteria that are suggested for their 
adoption and correct application.
