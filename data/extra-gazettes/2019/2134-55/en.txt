1. The witness stated earlier investigation was conducted by the Depot Technical Officers who were in charge of branch offices. They
were paid incentives for detections according to the Circular marked as R3. Whereas in 2008 investigation unit was established and
Investigation officers were appointed for the purpose of detection of illegal tapping of Electricity. Since they are doing only
investigation there was no need for them to pay incentives. He marked Depot Technical Officer’s duty list as R6. The witness
further stated Depot Technical Officer’s were paid incentives for detections as they performed those duties outside to the normal
