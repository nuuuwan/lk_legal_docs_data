METHODOLOGY   TO   IDENTIFY   LOW-INCOME   FAMILIES   FOR   WELFARE   BENEFIT   PAYMENTS
Common Criteria and Indicators for Selection
Methodology for identifying low-income families uses six criteria and each criterion is measured by using
particular  indicators (Part 1). Each applicant gets a maximum score of 100% and weighing of each indicator will be
calculated on number of poor families related to particular indicator based on Household Income and Expenditure Survey
(HIES) conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics. Calculation method of indicator’s cut-off is given in Part
II and the formula for Calculation of Deprivation Score is given in Part III. Part IV is the payment schemes for the four
programmes. The list of criteria and indicators is given in Part I below

PART III  1
Formula for Calculation of Deprivation Score :
Calculation of deprivation score for an individual is done in three steps
1. Calculation of indicator deprivation
2. Calculation of weight for indicators
3. Calculation of weighted deprivation score for individual
Calculation of indicator deprivation
If individual i, owns indicator j, then his/her indicator deprivation can be calculated using the following equation.
x
j (i) is the individual value on indicator j
then

j (i) = 1 ; if individual diprived in indicator j
j (i) = 0 ; if individual does not diprive in indicator j
Formular for weight function
Weights are generated using frequency-based weight function, indicators are weighted considering relative importance of
the different deprivations by districts using Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by the Department
of Census and Staistics once in three years. The weights will be fixed for this calculation for a period of time for  each
district and review once a new HIES data become available.
Where fj denotes the proportion of people who are deprived on j
th indicator in i th district in the HIES sample and k is the
number of indicators (i = 1,2 ....... 25 districts)
Lower weights mean to the criterion in which many people are less deprived to be, that is lower weights indicate lower
importance. Higher weights mean high frequency of ‘deprived people’ in a criterion that people  highly belong to deprivation
of that criterion. Higher weights indicate greater importance.
1 Formula for calculation was developed by the Department of Census and Statics
