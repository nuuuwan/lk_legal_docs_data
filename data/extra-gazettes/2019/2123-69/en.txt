Material: 
 
Omissions or misstatements of items are material if they could, individually or collectively, influence 
the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality depends 
on the size and nature of the omission or misstatem ent judged in the surrounding circumstances. 
The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be the determining factor.  
 
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis 
of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity. 
 
Materiality depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether 
information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its 
financial statements taken as a whole. 
 
Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar ef fect for primary users 
of financial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The following are examples of 
circumstances that may result in material information being obscured: 
 
(a) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the financial 
statements but the language used is vague or unclear; 
 
(b) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is scattered throughout the 
financial statements; 
 
(c) dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated;  
 
(d) similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and 
 
(e) the understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a result of material information being 
hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what 
information is material.

statements, and so be material, requires an entity to consider consideration of the characteristics of those 
users while also considering the entity’s own circumstances. 
 
Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to 
provide information directly to them  and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of 
the financial information they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose 
financial statements are directed. Financial statements are prepared for users who have  a reasonable 
knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At 
times, even well -informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand 
information about complex economic phenomena. 
 
The Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements states in paragraph 25 that 
‘users are assumed to have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting 
and a willingness to study the information with reasonable diligence.’ Therefore, the assessment needs to 
take into account how users with such attributes could reasonably be expected to be influenced in making 
economic decisions.

In other words, materia lity is an entity -specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, 
or both, of the items to which the information relates in the context of an individual entity’s financial 
report. Consequently, the Board cannot specify a uniform quantitative  threshold for materiality or 
predetermine what could be material in a particular situation.
