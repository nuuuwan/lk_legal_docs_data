PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE DEMOCRATIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC  OF  SRI  LANKA - 19.03.2019

appointment to the post of administrative officer
should be backdated to 01.03.1994 and that she should
receive the arrears in salary and the increments

she is entitled.”
The above mentioned industrial dispute, had been
referred to Mr. W. G . Deen, the Arbitrator, who heard and
completed hearing per industrial court case No. A 3404, on
12th October 2016. The said reference had been revoked
by the  Hon. Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations

Lanka Tobacco Industries Corporation, had not
considered, whenever promotions were made, in
advancing her carrier appointments. Whereas she
cited several cases of promotions being given to
persons with identical service, experience and
qualifications.
C. In the process, many times written complaints had
been made to the concerned authorities of Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka, political victimization
committees, Minister in Charge of MASL at the time,
and members of Parliament, but had no response
from such representatives.
She pleads that her period of service, at Sri Lanka
Tobacco Industries Corporation to be considered, in addition,
the qualifications she acquired over the tenure in
employment at Mahaweli Auhtority of Sri Lanka to be
recognized, and duly placed in promotional grades, which
have been deprived until retirement.

C. That just like the applicant, she too was appointed to

Officer, until she retired on 25 January 2011.
5. Respodent Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority's witness,
Mr. S. G . Ranjith, Administrative Assistant States
A. That she joined the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka
on 06 Feb. 1985, as a clerk and now is as
Administrative Assoistant.
B. Speaking about the applicant, he said that Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka did not have a job category
titled Veterinary Assistant, but since she was to be
absorbed into the cadre due to closure of Sri Lanka
Tobacco Industries Corporations, she was appointed
to Grade III of clerical servcie, but did not count
past service.
C. That the applicant had not brought the grievances to
the management, according to the applicants
personnal file. He further said that letters date on
03 July 2007. As well as 18 April 2001. Had not
seen Document A 24 was shown to the witness, who
said that Administrative Officer Mr. Nandasena had
accepted items 1 to 6, in that document.
D. On showing document A10, A17 and A18 which were
addressed to Minister and then only, her promotions
were affected.
6. My Findings and Observations
A . It is common in the private sector to change
ownership on account of closure, or sale. In such
instances, the new owner take over employees
ensuring wages, terms and conditions of employment
including past services. Past services needs to be
counted specially to recognize for purpose of
payment of Gratuity and any terminal benefits that
may arise.
B. It is unclear as to the manner of granting promotions,
applications are called from the eligible persons to
apply. But it is a mystery as the absence of a marking
formula. Since the number of vacancies existing may
be limited and number seeking may be many
Selection becomes complicated and involving
specially most of them do posses identical
qualifications. The marking formula forms the
guidelines such a applicants age, educational
attainment, experience, command of the language,
decision making ability etc. are some of them.
C. Also it's the prerogative of the management to
eliminate undesirables, such as chronic absentees,
those under disciplinary charges, black marks
concerning commission of offences. Charged on
abuse, corruption and insubordination, who are
generally unfit to hold positions of responsibility.
D. In this instance, interviews with no guidelines means,
selection criteria lacks transparency.
E. Applicant charge that certain persons have been
elevated to positions disregarding the experience and
qualifications, which fact respondent failed to
challenge. The persons cited are Mr. Moose Perera,
Mrs. M. E. Kumarihamy, Mrs. R. A. D. Indrani, Mr.
M. A. Nandasena and Mrs. Sriya Gamage.
F. At the time of recruitment applicant had passed G .
C. E. (Advanced Level) and by 2002, She had
obtianed two diplomas, one in Personnel
Management from National Institute of Business
Management and the other Diploma in Labour
Education from University of Colombo. In 2009 she
had secured the Degree on Labour Education from
the University of Colombo.
G . Mid stream, Applicant submitted to regulate her
appointment from the outset, but the Arbitrator is
not mandated to act beyond what is mentioned in the
reference. The principle of ultra vires applies.
7. Award
I have examined the evidence placed carefully and I
am satisfied that management had erred in the process of
promotional aspects. As such I award that the applicant's
following gradings -
1. Administrative Assistant to be from 01.01.1994,
2. Administrative Officer to be from 01.01.1999.
Backdated increments and arrears of salary be
deposited with Assistant Commissioner of Labour
(Colombo Central) Labour Secretariat, Colombo 05, to be
paid to her, within 45 days of publication of the award in the
Govt. Gazette.
This is just and a fair award.

Arbitrator.
