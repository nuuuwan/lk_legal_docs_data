Common Criteria and Indicators for Selection
Methodology for identifying low-income families uses six criteria and each criterion is measured by using particular
indicators (Part I). Each applicant gets a maximum score of 100% and weighing of each indicator will be calculated on
number of poor families related to particular indicator based on Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)
conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics. Calculation method of indicator’s cut-off is given in Part II and the
formula for Calculation of Deprivation Score is given in Part III. Part IV is the payment schemes for the four programs.
The list of criteria and indicators is given in Part I below.

Part III
Formula for Calculation of Deprivation Score:
Calculation of deprivation score for an individual is done in three steps;
1. Calculation of indicator deprivation
2. Calculation of weight for indicators
3. Calculation of weighted deprivation score for individual
Calculation of indicator deprivation
If individual i, owns indicator j, then his/her indicator deprivation can be calculated using the following equation;
  is the individual value on indicator j
Then
Formula for weight function
Weights are generated using frequency-based weight function. Indicators are weighted considering relative importance
of the different deprivations by districts using Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by the
Department of Census and Statistics once in three years. The weights will be fixed for this calculation for a period
of time for each district and review once a new HIES   data become available.
Where; 
  denotes the proportion of people who are deprived on j th  indicator in the i th district  in  the HIES
sample and k is the number of indicators ( i =1,2………………….25 districts).
Lower weights mean to the criterion in which many people are less deprived to be, that is lower weights indicate
lower importance. Higher weights mean high frequency of ‘deprived people’ in a criterion that people are highly
belong to deprivation of that criterion. Higher weights indicate greater importance.

Calculation of weighted deprivation score for individual
Where; 
  is the weighted deprivation score for individual. Weighted deprivation score is getting values between 0 and
1 in which towards zero (0) is less deprived and towards one (1) is highly deprived.
