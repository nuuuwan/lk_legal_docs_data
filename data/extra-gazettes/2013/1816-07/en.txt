January 2012, 4th May 2012, 12th June 2012, 20th July 2012.
Appointment of applicant as Chief Cashier :
The Applicant was appointed Temporary Cashier/Clerk at
the National Film Corporaion on 13th June, 1979 and was made
permanent on 14th December, 1979 on the retirement of the
Chief Cashier N. P. Peiris - Grade VII - who retired on 19th
April, 1989. On the retirement of the Chief Cashier the applicant,
in addition to his normal duties also performed the duties of
Chief  Cashier Peris and the Applicant was made aware of the
emoluments paid to acting officers by letter dated 22nd February
1993. This leter referred to the post of Grade VII Chief Cashier.
Reference was amde here to chapter 7 of the Establishment
Code paragraph 12:5:2 which showed acting Chief Casher's
emoluments as follows :
1. Chief Cashier's Salary Scale :
Rs. 2,200  50 x 5 - 75 x 14   Rs. 3,500.
2. Fonseka's salary from 19.04.1989 had reached -
Rs. 2,150
as set out in the Establishment Code for Grade VII -
paraph 12:5:2
3. From 1st January, 1990 Fonseka was eligible to a salary
of Rs. 2,200
Applicant's Service Record :
Applicant who was made permanent on 14.12.1979 has got
the following promtions.
01.01.1981 - Promoted to Cashier/Clerk Grade X
01.03.1983 Promoted to Cashier Grade IX
1.6.1994 Promoted to Cashier G rade VIII
1.2.2001 Promoted to Chashier Grade VII
His service record shows  that, the Applicant was appointed
on 13th June. 1979 as Cashier/Clerk Grade III and was
confirmed on that post on 14th December 1979. He was
promoted on 01st January. 1981 as Cashier/Clerk Grade X and
on 01st march. 1983 was promoted to Grade IX as Cashier/
Clerk. In 1989 he was appointed to perform the duties of the
Chief Cashier Grade VII who had retired by then - (P 1). From
19th April 1989 which date he was paid an acting allowance of
Rs. 90 based under the Establishment Code Chapter VII.
Section 12.5.1 and from 1st January, 1990 under Section 12.5.2.
of the Establishment Code, he has been paid an acting
allowance. Thereafter on 1st  June 1994 he was promoted to
Grade VIII and from 1st February 2001 he was promoted as
Cashier Grade VII. Under the new scheme introduced by the
Respondent Corporation there was no specific cadre for the
post of Chief Cashier, although there were grades above Grade
VII. This resulted in the applicant having to stagnate on Grade
VII. Fonseka had been recruited as the Cashier Clerk Grade III
an confirmed in the post on 14.12.1979. On 01.01.1981 he was
in the Grade X and was promoted to Grade IX on 01.03.1993.
On the retirement of the Cashier on 19.04.1989 who was serving
in Grade VII, an appointment was made to perform the duties
of this officer till a permanent officer is appointed. At the
applicant's request an acting allowance of Rs. 90 was paid.
Thereafter from 01.06.1994 he was promoted to Grade VIII on
01.01.2001. He was promoted to Grade VII. Form Grade 9 as the
applicant has been performing the duties of the Chief Cashier
and he had made many requests that he be appoined to the
Post of  Chief Cashier. Under the provisions of the
Establishment Code, the Department of Management Services
which is under the Ministry of Finance and Planning
recommend certain changes in the scheme of retirement of
staff and promotiion to higher grades. This had not included
the Chief Cashier's post as one such scheduled post. The
only post included for the Chief Cashier was Grade VII, which
was in the way of Fonska appointed to that post, straight
away.
At the time of his retirement Fonseka has arrived at the
maximum of Grade MA - 1 -1 Though permittion was sought to
place Fonseka by creating a post equivalent to IM - 1 -1 such

permission was not granted as such posts could not be created
for the purpose of benefitting any targeted employee and not
meant for the general staff.
Department of Management Services Circular No. 30 makes
reference to Board Decisions taken on 19th November 2008
and the Report submitted by the Personnel Division is of  the
view that salary anomalies would arise if 2 extra salary
increments are made personnel to the applicant and w as not
given to the Chief Cashier as there are other employees of the
same seniority as the applicant, who cover up duties other
than duties they have been assigned. This made the applicant
to stagnate at G7.
The Film Corporation was started in 1972 and the Chief
Cashier Mr. G . H. Peris who is one of its earliest employees and
has his Employees' Provident Fund - E.P.F. No. as 33. When
the Chief Cashier (Mr. G. H. Peris) retired he was in Grade VII
and there was no provision for promotion above Grade VII.
On the retirement of the Chief Cashier the applicant Fonseka
was appointed to act for him, for which he was paid on acting
allowance from 01.01.1990.
In the evidence of the applicant (page 38 of proceedings)
in answer to a question the Applicant stated that he had acted
for a period of over 21 years till he retired on  17 Feburary 2011.
This is a fallacious and mesleading statement. During this
period he had made many requests to the Respondent Board
to make him permanent in his acting post. In response to a
request on behalf of the Applicant to promote him and make
the post MA - 1 personal to Fonseka, the National Salaries
and Cadres Commission intervened by its letter No. NSCC/2/
1/5/1/15 - V olume.11 (Page 216) and 26 April 2010 and expressed
the view that MA - 1 - 1 is the Grade that would be most
beneficial to the applicant and. Ths failure and/or delay on the
part of the Film Corporation to prepare details of the scheme
of promotions did not enable Fonseka to receive his
promotions and all his other dues on the due dates. It could
now be rectified after presenting it for necessary approval.
This was the view expressed by Mr. B. Wijayarathna Secretary
of the National Wages and Cadres Commission (Page No. 29).
We have also been concious of the great risk the applicant
and those performing the task of Cashiers' undergo in their
day today perfromance of their duties in handling large
amounts of cash, Banking them, their disbursement to theatres
etc. which is performed at great risk to their lives specially at
times like the present violence-prone days.
Presently Fonseka on Salary Scale MA 1-1 draws 13,450 =
145 x 10 - 170 x 7 - 240 x 4 - 320 x 20 = 23,450. His present salary
scale which he has reached - 23,460 =, as his monthly salary
has carried with it numerouns increments during the period of
his service despite his misleading and fanciful statement that
he had acted for a period of 21 years, a claim which has to be
rejected outright.
The salary scale for Grade VII is Rs. 7190 - 10,270 - 13 x 150
which scale the Applicant has reached and received all his
increments. In recognition of the good service record
maintained by the Applicant Fonseka. I would commend that
he be paid two extra increments from the salary point he has
reched. This payment should include all the allowances and
other benefits he would have drawn during this period of
2 years.
Under thse circummstances I consider this Award a just
and equitable Award.
