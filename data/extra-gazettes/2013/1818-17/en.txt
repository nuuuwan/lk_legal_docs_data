entitled.”

Respondant Employer.
4. On the first day of the inquiry, parties indicated that the
Department of Labour had instituted action, for the recovery

Concerning the other issued, which are before the

matters amicably. Pending a final resolve, the Applicant was
requested to file a sworn affidavit, placing vital evidence, for
Respondents to commence cross-examination.
