PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 22.08.2013
(Special Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968, appointed me
as the Arbitrator by his Order dated 10.11.2010 and
referred the dispute between the aforesaid parties to
me for settlement by arbitration.
02. The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is
“whether Mr. P. G. Seneviratne who is presently
employed as a security Officer Grade B-1 of the Ceylon
Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited is entitled to be
appointed to the Grade A-7 with arreas of salary in
terms of the recommendations of the Political
Victimization Committee which was implemented in
respect of the members of the staff of the said
establishment as from 16.06.2005 and if so entitled what
relief he should be granted by the said company”
03 Appearances :
Mr. P. Liyanage Attorney-at-Law appeared for the
workman assisted by Mr. P. Vimal Jayasuriya Attorney-
at-Law. Miss. Thavisha Jayasinghe Attorney-at-Law
from Attorney General’s Department appeared for
Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited.
At the inquiry conducted by me, Mr. P. G. Seneviratne,
workman commenced the case and gave evidence. His
evidence in chief was by way of an Affidavit. He was
cross examined by the Learned Counsel of the
Respondent company and thereafter he was re-
examined by his counsel. His case was concluded
marking the documents A to U and written submissions
were tendered thereafter with marked documents. The
Respondent Company led the evidence of Mr. R. A. A.
Sisira Jayantha Perera Human Resources Assistant,
Mr. R. P . B. Purana Gedara Assistant Secretary Cabinet
of Minister and closed the case marking documents
R1 to R19. Written submissions were tendered by the
Respondent along with the marked documents R1to
R19.
04. Facts in brief :
The position of Mr. P. G. Seneviratne is that the Political
Victimization Committee has recommended promotion
to him to Grade A-7. The respondent company
maintains that the Political Victimization Committee did
not recommend promotion to him to Grade A-7 but to
Grade B-1 and it was accordingly made.
05. Issues to be determined :
(i) What was the recommendation of the Political
Victimization Committee in respect of Mr. P. G .
Seneviratne Security Officer Grade B-1 ?
(ii) Has the Respondent Company implemented the
recommendation in respect of Mr. P . G .
Seneviratne ?
(iii) Is Mr. P. G. Seneviratne entitled to any relief and if
so to what relief?
06. Analysis of evidence of the Workman :
The burden is on the Workman who claims that Political
Victimization Committee has recommended promotion
to him to Grade A7 to prove that such a
recommendation was made by the Political
Victimization Committee. He commenced the case and
stated in his evidence in Chief by way of Affidavit -
Pages 37-39 of the Case Record, inter alia , as
follows :
(i) He made an Application to the respondent for
promotion as he heard promotion had been given
to employees by the Respondent credited with
three years’ service ;
(ii) Although he was called for interviews he was not
promoted and promotions were given to other
who had less qualification that him ;
(iii) During the period of his service he had performed
duties in Grade A6 & A7 in the absence of
permanent Officers on those posts ;
(iv) The Political Victimization Committee appointed
on 16th of June 2005 had offered two
promotions ;
(v) He made an application for promotion but he was
offered one promotion that is Grade B1 ;
(vi) He has been employed for more than 10 years. He
has made an application for promotion to Grade
A7 as he has the maximum qualification for that
post ;
(vii) He has more qualifications than (08) eight
employees who were to be given promotion in
Grade A6 & A7 ;
(viii) The  Security Manager had recommended him
but he was not given the promotion to Grade A7.
Under cross examination he had said that he did
not remember the date he made an application for
the promotion and said further that he would
produce the application on the next date. Pages
63 & 64 of the proceedings of 14.11.2011. On the
next date he did not produce the application, but
stated that he was called for interview based on

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 22.08.2013
his application and marked the said letter as ‘H’.
It came to light that ‘H’ was in reference to an
application made by him to the Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation and not to the Respondent Company.
To a question posed by me, he admitted that he
was not called for interviews by the respondent
Company. It is clear from the foregoing that he
has not applied to the respondent Company for
promotion. this allegation against the Respondent
in relation to his promotion therefore fails.
His evidence that he had been acting for Grades
A6 & A7 cannot be accepted as according to leave
chits marked by him as J. K. L. & M, he had only
covered the duties when officers were on leave.
In his evidence-in-chief he has not stated that
Political Victimization Committee has
recommended promotion to Grade A7 to him.
Undercross examination he has stated as
follows :
Q: I put it to you that the Political Victimization
Committee has not recommended A7 to you and
therefore you can’t ask for A7 promotion from the
respondent ?
A: At that time I was recommended to A7 by the
Political Victimization Committee but I was given
Only B1.
Q: Where is it stated that Political Victimization
Committee has recommended A7 to you ?
A: The Political Victimization Committee told me
that I have been recommended.
Q: When did the Political Victimization Committee
tell that to you ?
A: During the oral conversation.
Q: Were you given it in writing anytime ?
A: No.
Pages 74 & 75 of one proceedings of 09.12.2011.
His evidence on this score would appear to be
false. He has failed to prove that he was
recommended by the Political Victimization
Committee for promotion to Grade A7. The
position taken up by the workman that he was
recommended by security Manager for promotion
cannot be accepted when viewed in the light of
the document F(c) which says “he is to be
considered for promotion”. The workman who was
appealing for promotion has admitted that he
wrote R5 to the Personnel Manager on 09.08.2007.
This letter is offensive and in a threatening tone
vide R5 (a). His approach would appear to be
wrong in that his letter is couched in vituperative
language. His letter dated 09.08.2007 has been
replied by the Personnel Manager on 29.08.2007
and marked as R6. These two letters R5 & R6 are
self explanatory.
07. Analysis of the evidence of the Respondent Company.
Mr. A. A. Sisira Jayantha Perera Human Resources
Assistant in his evidence has stated, inter Alia  as
follows :
(i) The workman cannot says that he had been acting
in Grade A6 & A7 relying on R9 to R12 (Leave
chits marked by the workman as J,K,L, & M
respectively) ;
(ii) Whenever a worker goes on leave his work should
be covered by another worker and that worker
should be in the same Grade or in Higher Grade.
This duty can be done only for that period of
leave ;
(iii) On the basis R9 to R12 (Leave Chits J, K, L & M
respectively) he cannot claim promotion to Grade
A6 and A7. Page 96 of the case record. Proceedings
of 22.08.2012 at page 05 ;
(iv) There were three vacancies for Senior Assistant
Security Officer Grade A7. 23 came for the
interview. This workman was not selected as he
was not suitable when compared to others. This
workman has scored 40-1/2 marks while the other
employees who were selected have scored 61 1/2
marks, 60 1/2 marks and 59 marks ;
(v) His position according to marks scored was 10.
He has produced as R16 the scheme of marking ;
(vi) He has not got Grade A7 from the interview or
from Political victimization Committee.
Pages 01 to 08 of the proceedings of 14.09.2012.
Pages 98-105 of the case record.
Under cross examination he has stated that
Political victimization Committee has
recommended this workman to be promoted to

Grade B1. To a specific question from me “was he
given B1? His answer was ‘Yes’ It was put to him
under cross-examination that Political
victimization Committee recommended to this
workman promotion to Grade is A7 but the
company purposely did not give him the
promotion, he denied that. He has in re-
examination stated that the company had given
the promotions recommended by the Political
victimization Committee.
Mr. P. B. Purnagedara Assistant Secretary of the
Office of Cabinet of Ministers gave evidence and
produced the report of the Political victimization
Committee as R17 which he said was received on
15.06.2005 at the office of the Cabinet of Ministers.
I find in R18 the letter of 15.06.2005 to Secretary to
the Cabinet from Secretary Ministry of Power and
Energy the date stamp 15.06.2005 of the office of
Cabinet. He has stated that this workman has been
recommended for promotion to Grade B1 and his
name in the report was marked as R17(a). It was
put to him that this report was not the original. He
has said that 17 is the original. In para-20 of the
written submissions of the workman it has been
stated that R17 is undated which shows it is not
the original, but it was prepared for this case. This
statement would appear to be unfair and unkind
for the following reasons :
(i) The marking of the report R17 was not objected
to at the time of marking ;
(ii) R18 and R19 can be taken as supportive evidence
of the authenticity of the report R17 ;
(iii) The Report R17  in respect of 1020 employees has
been signed by three signatories in every page.
The Report R17 runs from pages 289 to 397 in the
case record (108 pages in all) ;
(iv) The report does not bear the date. For this reason
it cannot be said that it is not authentic. The
objection in relation to the report is rejected by
me.
08. My determination of the issued is as follows :
(i) The Recommendation of the Political Victimization
Committee in respect of Mr. P. G . Seneviratne
Security Officer Grade B-1 was that he be promoted
to Grade B1 vide R17 (a) ;
(ii) The Respondent Company has implemented the
recommendation in respect of Mr. P . G .
Seneviratne ;
(iii) Mr. P. G. Seneviratne is not entitled to any relief.
09. Taking into consideration the totality of the evidence
led by both sides with particular reference to the written
submissions together with marked documents
tendered by both sides, I hold that Mr. P. G . Seneviratne
does not merit any relief. I therefore, make No. award
and go a step further to state that this award is Just
and Equitable.
