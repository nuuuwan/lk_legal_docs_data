constituted Board of Members appointed instead ;
And now, therefore, I, Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, in pursuance
of the provisions of Article 33 of the Constitution, do hereby, reposing great trust and confidence in your prudence, ability
and fidelity, by these presents, appoint you the said ;
1. Prof. Hithanadura Janaka de Silva Esquire

the aforesaid original Directive.
And I, futher appoint Prof. Hithanadura Janaka de Silva Esquire as Chairman of the National Research Council.

matters as may be necessary in relation to the execution of the tasks it is hereby entrusted with.
And I, do hereby require and direct all public officers and such other persons to whom the National Research
Council may issue instructions or apply for assistance for information, to comply with such instructions, render all such
