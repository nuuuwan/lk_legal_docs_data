Report  of the Auditor General:    Review Report on the Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as at 31st August, 2013
I have reviewed the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) as at 31st August, 2013. This Balance Sheet is the Responsibility of the Management of the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka. My responsibility is to issue a report on this Balance Sheet based on my review.
I, conducted my review in accordance with Sri Lanka Standards on Review Engagements 2400 applicable to review engagements. This Standard requires that the review should be planned and performed
to obtain moderate assuarance as to whether the Balance Sheet is free of material misstatements. The review is limited primarily to inquiries of personel of the CBSL and analytical procedures applied
to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit.
Based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the accompanying Balance Sheet does not give a true and fair view.
H. A. S. Samaraweera,
Auditor General.
