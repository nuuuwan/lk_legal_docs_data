STCW Code shall hold a certificate of competency or certificate of proficiency, as applicable.
Principles governing the issue of Alternative Certificates
15.  (1) The relevant Chief Examiner shall ensure that —
(a) no alternative certification system is implemented unless it ensures a degree of safety at sea and has a
preventive effect as regards pollution at least equivalent to that provided by the other chapters of the STCW
Code; and
(b) any arrangement for alternative certification under chapter VII of the STCW Code shall provide for the inter-
changeability of certificates with those issued under other chapters.
(2) The principle of inter-changeability in sub-regulation (1) above shall ensure that:-
(a) seafarers certificated under the arrangements of chapters II and/or III of STCW Code and those certificated
under chapter VII of the STCW Code are able to serve on ships which have either traditional or other forms
of shipboard organization; and
(b) seafarers are not trained for specific shipboard arrangements in such a way as would impair their ability to
take their skills elsewhere.
  (3) In issuing any certificate under the provisions of chapter VII of the STCW Code, the following principles shall
be taken into account:-
(a) the issue of alternative certificates shall not be used in itself:-
(i) to reduce the number of crew on board,
(ii) to lower the integrity of the profession or “de-skill” seafarers, or
(iii) to justify the assignment of the combined duties of the engine and deck watchkeeping officers to a
single certificate holder during any particular watch; and
(b) the person in command shall be designated as the master; and the legal position and authority of the master
and others shall not be adversely affected by the implementation of any arrangement for alternative
certification.
Issue of Alternative Certificates to Ratings

Notes:
1 Rows 1 and 2 of the above table describe (a) ordinary shipboard tasks, functions, events and conditions, (b) the
corresponding physical abilities which may be considered necessary for the safety of a seafarer, other crew
members and the ship, and (c) high-level criteria for use by approved medical practitioners assessing medical
fitness, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers and the nature of shipboard work for which they will be
employed.
2 Row 3 of the above table describes (a) ordinary shipboard tasks, functions, events and conditions, (b) the
corresponding physical abilities which shall be considered necessary for the safety of a seafarer, other crew
members and the ship, and (c) high-level criteria for use by approved medical practitioners assessing medical
fitness, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers and the nature of shipboard work for which they will be
employed.
3 This table is not intended to address all possible shipboard conditions or potentially disqualifying medical
conditions. Approved Medical practitioners should use their professional judgement on physical abilities
applicable to the category of seafarers (such as “Deck officer” and “Engine rating”). The special circumstances
of individuals and for those who have specialized or limited duties should receive due consideration.
4 If in doubt, the medical practitioner should quantify the degree or severity of any relevant impairment by means
of objective tests, whenever appropriate tests are available, or by referring the candidate for further assessment.
5 The term “assistance” means the use of another person to accomplish the task.
6 The term “emergency duties” is used to cover all standard emergency response situations such as abandon
ship or fire fighting as well as the procedures to be followed by each seafarer to secure personal survival.
