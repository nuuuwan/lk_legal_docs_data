Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, chapter 131 of
the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised Edition)
as amended by Acts Nos. 14 and 62 of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39
of 1968 read with Industrial Disputes (Special Provisions)
Act, No. 37 of 1968 appointed me as the Arbitrator by his
order dated 27th August, 2008 and referred the dispute
between the aforesaid parties to me for settlement by
arbitration.
02. The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties
is :
“Whether any unjust was caused to Mrs. M. D. Sriyalatha
for not effecting payments to her under the voluntary
compensation scheme implemented by the Hingurana Sugar
Industries Limited for its employees despite the fact that, her
service had been terminated in terms of her application made
to leave the company’s service under the compensation
scheme and if such an unjust was caused, to what relief Mrs.
M. D. Sriyalatha is entitled.”
03. Late Mr. Wilbert Perera appeared for the applicant while
Mr. Hemantha Situge, Attorney-at-Law appeared for the
Respondent institution.
04. Initial objections were raised concerning the validity
of the reference, Having examined the submissions, the
objection made by the Respondent was over-ruled.
Thereafter on completion of evidence in chief of the
applicant, Respondent lawyer cross-examined. After several
days of protracted hearings, applicant tendered a written
application to withdraw the case against the Respondent
institution without any right to raise the issue afreshvide
page 222 in case file. Since then she had not shown any
interest.
05. I therefore make award that the applicant is no longer
interested in persuing the matter in dispute.

INTERPRETA TION    OF     THE    AWARD
The Commissioner of Labour (Labour Relations) requested
an interpretation of the order made by me on 11th March,
2012.
Whereas in the said order it was stated that Mrs. M. I. M.
J. Samarawickrama be paid arrears of salary increments due
for the period 01.01.2003 to 01.09.2008 in respect of the
Agricultural Economist Post held by Mrs. M. I. M. J.
Samarawickrama.
Whereas the Respondent submitted to the Hon. Magistrate
Court, Kaduwela in Case No. 37459 that the Applicant was
paid the salary arreas and increments due to her for the Post
of Agricultural Economist held by her.
Whereas by said Award the Arbitrator has come to a
conclusion that the Respondent Authority has acted unjustly
and unfairly towards the Applicant, Mrs. M. I. M. J.
Samarawickrama without granting due promotion and even
ignoring the Supreme Court directive.
Whereas it was concluded by the Abitrator as for the said
Award the Applicant’s present position should be backdated
to 1st January 2003 (the day in which an irregular appointment
was given to an another person as Assistant General Manger
(Services).
