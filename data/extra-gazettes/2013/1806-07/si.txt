In the Matter of an Industrial Dispute Between
Mr. Fedrick S. Benjamin,
of No. 15/2, Off de Saram Road,
Mount-Lavinia.
Applicant
Case No. A-3099 and
Asian Hotels and Properties, Limited,
No. 77, Galle Road,
Colombo 03.
Respondent
ORDER
Hon Athauda Senevirathna, Minister of Labour Relations
Foreign Employment, by virtue of the powers vested in him
by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Dispute Act Chapter 131 of
the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised Edition)
as amended by Acts numbers 14 of 1957 and, 4 of 1962 and 39
of 1968 (read with Industrial Dispute (Special Provision) Act
no. 37 of 1968) appointed me to be Arbitrator by his Order
Acted 11.04.2005 and referred the above said dispute to me
for settlement by Arbitration.
The matters in Dispute between the aforsaid parties are -
(1) Whether the termination of the Services of Mr. Fedrick
S. Benjamin by Asian Hotels and Properties, Limited is
justified and if not what relief he is entitled, and
(2) Whether the non granting of annual bonus for the
Financial year 2003/2004 to Mr. Fedrick S. Benjamin by
Asian Hotel and Properties, Limited is justified and, if
not to what relief he is entitled.
After the parties submitted their statements, the inquiry
commenced on 15.09.2005. At the inquiry Mr. Rathnapala
Peris, Attorney-at-Law appeared for the Applicant and Mr.
Gomin Dayasiri Attorney-at-Law appeared for the Respondent
Company.
After several dates of inquiry, the Learned Counsel for the
Respondent, wanted to mark the domestic inquiry proceedings
through the last Witness Mr. F. N. de Silva which application
was disallowed by me as arbitrator. The Counsel for the
Respondent thereafter filed a Writ Application against my
order, in the Court of Appeal No. 04/2009.
The Hon Court of Appel up-held my decision as arbitrator
but the Respondent Company appealed against the decision
of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court and the Supreme
Court by a Three-Judge bench decision allowed the appeal
of the respondent Company in S.C. No. 143/2010. S.C. (sp1)
No. 132/2010, I am bounded by the decision of the Supreme-
Court.
The Parties were summoned by the Registrar of Industrial
Court to appear on 30.01.2013 to convey the order of the
Supreme Court on which date the Senior Counsel Mr. Gomin
Dayasiri appeared for the respondent Company, but the
applicant was absent and unrepresented. It was brought to
my Notice that the applicant Fredirck S. Benjamin had left the
Island having appointed Mr. Devan Hillary Devendran Daniel
as his Attorney. He was noticed to be present before the
arbitrator on 14.02.2013 on which date Mr. Devan Hillary
Devandran Daniel appeared before arbitrator with his
Attorney-at-Law Mr. Thilak Wijesooriya who stated that the
applicant is no longer interested in the matter.
Mr.Gomin Dayasiri the Counsel for the Respondent
Company emphasized that the applicant was not present in
either the Court of Appeal or in the Supreme Court when the
case was taken up for argument.
In view of the submissions of Mr. Gomin Dayasiri, the
Counsel for the Respondent Company and the statement made
by Mr. Thilak Wijesooriya Attorney-at-Law who appeared
for the Attorney-at-Law of the applicant I hold that there is
no Industrial Dispute between the applicant and the
Respondent and I dismiss the application ask make no Award
in favour of the Applicant.
