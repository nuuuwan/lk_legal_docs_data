03. Mr. A. S. Seneviratne Attorney at Law appeared for the
applicant Union, while Mr. Vajira Ellepola, Asst. Director
General, Employers Federation of Ceylon appeared for the
respondent employer.
04. At the outset, both the Union and the Employers were
briefed on the time that might take for the resolution of the
dispute and as such suggested both parties to arrive at a
settlement. But the suggestion did not materialize. However
one workman W. M. Laksiri Prasad withdrew from the case -
wide page 107 in file.
Briefly stated, following persons tendered oral evidence
on behalf of the union. They were-
(a) Siriwardena Pathiranage Sumathipala ;
(b) Hewapathiranage Prasad Chaminda Pathirana ;
(c) Nissanka Udeni Rangajeewa, and ;
(d) Nissanka Arachchilage Wimalaratne.
Wimalaratne had only completed the examination in chief and
was waiting for the cross examination on 09th December 2011.
The respondent employer’s representative on this day
informed the court, thus -

Applicant union requested hearing of the case and on
05.11.2012 both parties were summoned, but the Attorney at
Law for the union was not present. Following explains the
result of the meeting -

The hearing of the case halted abruptly .
05. Findings -
(1) Since the respondent's evidence is yet to be heard, no
interim or final decision could be made. The principle
of natural justice - Audi Altaram Partem applies.
(2) The vesting of the Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd.,
with the State, in terms of Revival of Underperforming
Enterprises or Underutilized Assets, Act No. 43 of  2011,
the matter in dispute cannot be taken up in terms of
Sec. 49 of the Industrial Dispute Act.
Operation of Law, prevents the arbitrator from proceeding
with the case and as such no relief could be gratned to the
aggrieved parties. I make the award accordingly.
P. Navaratne,
Arbitrator.
