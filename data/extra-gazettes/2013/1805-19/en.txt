THE AW ARD
The matters in dispute has arisen between (1) S. D.
Premaratna of 2nd Lane, Paragahapitiya Watta, Kuliyapitiya
of the one part (Applicant) and the Sri Lanka Transport Board
(SLTB) of No. 200, Kirula Road, Colombo 05 of the other part
(Respondent).
The matter in dispute before the aforesaid parties is :
“Whether any injustice was caused to Mr. S. D.
Premaratna due to the imposition of penalties by order
dated 26.12.1995 of the Deputy General Manager
(Technical) of the then Sri Lanka Central Transport Board
while having exonerated him of all the charges framed
against him in the charge sheet dated 11.11.1993 while
he was serving as the Engineer in charge of the
Udabaddawa Regional Workshop of the Board and
if any injustice was caused, and to what relief he is
entitled to.”
The case was taken up on 18 days from 02.06.2010 and the
parties agreed to come to a settlement. The Commissioner
General of Labour was also consulted and was made aware of
the proceedings that had taken place (P 228). The settlement
which was arrived at was to be implemented on the following
conditions :-
The following are the charges in brief
01. The first charge is an allegation against the applicant
of using a letter purporting to be from the
Nikawaratiya Multi Purpose Corporative Society
(MPCS). This charge was not proved.
02. The 2nd charge he was found not guilty.
03. Theft of a cupboard, appears to have been removed
with permission.
04. Movement of the trolley from the workplace, which
was removed, appears to have been done with the
permission of the security division.
05. Caused a loss of Rs. 1,500 to the Board by the
unauthorized disposal of a cupboard.
06. Misusing the letter head of the Nikawaratiya MPCS
for an unlawful purpose. This charge was not proved.
The applicant was found not guilty of the first charge and
conclusion arrived at was that he was therefore not guilty of
the other charges.
The case which was taken up for hearing on 02.06.2010
was held on 18 days after which the parties agreed to arrive at
a settlement on the following terms and conditions :-
(a) The applicant agreed to limit his claim to a sum of Rs.
25,000 which the Respondent Board agreed to pay.
(b) The applicant agreed to make no further claims
regarding this case No. 3305 to any other forum.
(c) The applicant states that the charge sheet issued to
him on 11.11.1993 which also notes certain
punishments, are not the result of an order made by
an approved legal body. These remarks stated above
are superficial.
(d) The applicant disclaims any right to make further
claims arising out of case No. 3305.
(e) This is to be considered a full and final payment to
the applicant.
The Service record of the applicant
He was appointed Grade IX apprentice in the SLTB on
01.08.1971, on 01.08.1976 appointed Foreman Grade VIII. In
07.03.1998 was appointed Acting Engineer SLTB and promoted
as Engineer and was attached to the CTB Depot, Kurunegala.
Halfway through the proceedings, the parties agreed to
come to a settlement in order to expedite the matter. The
applicant was to receive a sum of Rs. 25,000 from the
Respondent SLTB which payment was to be a once and for all
payment which was made by cheque No. 365238 on 25.07.2012.
He has acknowledge receipt of this which is embodied in the
inside cover of the file and witnessed by the Arbitrator.
It was clear throughout the proceedings that this case had
not followed a set uniform standard or pattern in holding its
disciplinary inquiries and the manner of imposing punishments
was subject to numerous procedural defects. The Assistant
Commissioner of Labour has raised certain doubts in this
matter.
It was observed that the service record of the applicant
was not unblemished and he has been dealt with disciplinarily.
The applicant also maintained that punishments imposed on
him tended to be excessive and too harsh despite his holding
an Executive Post of Engineer.

Inordinate Delay
On the charge sheet of 11.11.1993 the disciplinary order
was made (6) six years later on 23.08.1999, that too, the letter
had been prepared one year earlier on 04.06.1998. This
inordinate delay would be prejudicial to the parties while
keeping them in suspense for a long period.
The settlement arrived at by Premaratne the applicant and
the Respondent SLTB of Kirula Road, Colombo 05 and the
payment of Rs. 25,000 to the applicant is embodied as part and
parcel of the award made on 27.02.2013.
This matter was also referred to the Asst. Commissioner of
Labour Kurunegala (page 12) on 06.03.2000, who has brought
out the following matters.
(i) The Board has not followed hitherto accepted
practices or precedents regarding the payments to
be made on re-instatement after interdiction.
(ii) In addition to the charges contained in the charge
sheet additional charges have been added contrary
to accepted practice and also refers to the possibility
of losing the services of an experienced Executive
Officer and Engineer.
Under these circumstances the Asst. Commissioner of
Labour is of the view that the applicants case should be
considered sympathetically (Page 11 - Page 21).
There are several instances when the applicant has been
punished for various acts of misconduct. But what is striking
is that these sentences vary in their gravity and there is no
standard which has been set in imposing punishment. These
punishments are subject to the vagaries of the officer imposing
punishment. The disciplinary rules of the Board are enumerated
under schedule “A”. There are 34 acts of misconduct and
under schedule “B” 11 acts of misconduct are not considered
grave. There is also provision in schedule “E” for appeal against
disciplinary orders to appellate authority. However non of
these provisions have been correctly used in instilling
discipline in this institution.
I consider this settlement as a just and equitable award.

EEN,
Arbitrator.
