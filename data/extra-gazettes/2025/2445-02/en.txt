The objectives of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission, as stipulated in Section 5 of the Colombo Port 
City Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021, have been considered in designating the business as a Business 
of Strategic Importance, in order to ensure the success of establishing the Colombo Port City, having regard to the 
national interest or the advancement of the national economy as provided for in Section 53(5) of the said Act.
Ceylon Real Estate Holdings (Private) Limited., incorporated in Sri Lanka, is an Authorized Person and a subsidiary 
of Browns Investments PLC, which is the strategic investment arm of LOLC Holdings PLC. Browns Investments 
have extensive investments in Sri Lanka and overseas, in sectors such as leisure, agriculture, plantation, construction 
and real estate, providing a solid foundation for Ceylon Real Estate Holdings initiatives.
Ceylon Real Estate Holdings (Private) Limited. aims to develop a business and commercial city complex in Mixed-
Use Land Plot 1-02-01 of 30,629.92 sqm.
Ceylon Real Estate Holdings (Private) Limited. intends to invest approximately with an initial allocation of USD 
320,401,000 for construction costs and USD 90,618,000 for other costs including feasibility & design consultancy, 
project management fees, contingency cost, advance expense & brokerage fees and interest during construction 
raised from foreign direct investment and LKR 32,155,846,800 for Land investment in Colombo Port City.
This flagship project within Port City Special Economic Zone (SEZ) will encompass 53,602 sqm of Grade A office 
space, 22,972 sqm of retail themed centralized commercial space, and 84,232 sqm of high-end residential space. 
The office spaces within the project are expected to accommodate 4,000-6,000 individuals, fostering job creation 
in finance, IT, logistics and other related sectors. The project is designated to attract industries such as finance, IT, 
engineering, energy logistics, and consulting services, thereby creating substantial employment opportunities for 
the local population in these sectors. Additionally, the duty-free shopping center and high-end residential units will 
attract international investors, international tourists generating foreign currency inflow and provide employment 
opportunities to the local population with foreign currency earnings.
This mixed-use building development is central to the strategic vision of the Colombo Port City SEZ, focusing on 
enhancing Sri Lanka's financial services sectors and drawing related industries to the Colombo Port City. This project 
is an impetus for creating an international financial center within Colombo Port City, contributing to economic and 
social development in Sri Lanka.
