The Applicant joined the Respondent Board as a Lathe Machine operator on contract basis. Thereafter he worked as Senior 
foreman and as a Procurement Officer attached to the Sri Langama Hatton Depot. Further he said he was assigned to 
purchase spare parts. he has been doing this job for a period of about 8 years.
he further said he was interdicted due to false complaint.(A1). charge Sheet A 2. he said he rejected all the allegations. (A3)
 
He further said prior to Charge Sheets being issued there was an inquiry conducted by Delpitiya Provincial Office in which 
no charge was leveled against the Applicant.
 
He further said by 2nd inquiry held by Sabaragamuwa Provincial Office charges were framed against him. According to Sri 
Langama disciplinary rules a disciplinary inquiry has to be concluded within 4 months.
 
The applicant said his inquiry lasted 9 months.
 
The Applicant said he rejected the 1st charge.It says on 9.6.2008 the Applicant obtained Rs 25,000/= by IoU from hatton 
Depot.
 
he said he denied taking a such amount.
 
he said he was given Rs 25,000/= by Depot Manager.
 
he further said Deport Manager who got the cheque, countersigned and sent it to the bank through a Peon and obtained the 
cash.
 
He said he further worked as a procurement officer of the Depot in 2008 in addition to his normal work.
 
he further said if the value of spare parts are more than Rs. 25,000/ and not available in the Stores Depot Engineer get the 
approval from provincial Engineer.Depot Manager got the money.but the voucher was in the name of the Applicant.
 
he further said after getting necessary approval he went to colombo and purchased the spare parts necessary for two buses.
 
As a 3rd charge he was alleged that he purchased spare parts for Rs 2140/ and Rs.13150/= respectively by submitting 
false bills, he disputed that charge.He further said that inquiring officer found him not guilty. He further said incident was 
supposed to taken place on 9.06.2008 and charges were framed against him after 5 years.he further said that he refused all 
charges 1 to 7.
Since the Applicant was not satisfied with the Order of the Disciplinary Inquiry he made an Appeal. Since no justice being 
done the Applicant came to the Industrial court. With regard to the charge no.4 the Applicant was acquitted by the inquiring 
officer. (A 9)
 
With regard to charge No.5, The Applicant stated that he has acted correctly by showing spare parts he bought to the 
Security, to the head of his section and finally handed over to the Stores.
 
With regard to charge No. 6 and 7,the Applicant was not found guilty of either taking bribes or any fraudulent act.he was 
suspended for a period of 3 months.( the said order was removed later by Appeal order marked A10).
 
During the period of suspension the Applicant’s salary was not paid and he was asked to pay Rs. 15,290/ to the Respondent.
 
In contrast the Party of the Second Part has failed to prove their case.
 
After taking into totality of evidence, I have come to following conclusion.
 
a. The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the Applicant by suspending his services unfairly.

b. The Respondent has acted maliciously and irresponsible manner by asking the Applicant to pay Rs 15,290/= by way a 
disciplinary order.
 
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe (1991) 
that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the 
contract of employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect of the award 
is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator creates a new 
contract for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract. An industrial 
arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force in the future when he cannot get the 
parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
 
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the First 
part: Applicant I.G.G.Thushara Abeyratna
 
be paid a sum of Rupees Two hundred Fifty Eight Thousand Eight hundred and Forty Three and cents Seventy Four  
(Rs 258,843.74) as compensation ( Salary denied to the Applicant:Rs. 243,553.74 + Rs 15,290/ being amount paid by the
 
Applicant to the Respondent) by the Respondent, Sri Lanka Transport Board (party of the Second part).
 
And the aforesaid money should be deposited by the Party of the Second Part at the office of the Assistant Commissioner of 
Labour, colombo East.
 
I further make order that this award should be implemented within 21 days of the publication in the Government Gazette of 
the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
 
I consider this award is just and equitable.
 
 Kapila M. Sarathchandra,
 Arbitrator.
