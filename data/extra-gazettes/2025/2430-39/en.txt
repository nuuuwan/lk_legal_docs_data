To the Members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka
   
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements        
        
Opinion 
       
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (the 
institute), which comprise the Statement of financial position as at December 31, 2024, and the Statement of Comprehensive 
income, Statement of Changes in funds and reserves, and Statement of Cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. I have also audited the statements of Financial 
Position of F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Price Fund as at 31st December 2024.  
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, the accompanying financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the financial position of the Institute, F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 
December 31, 2024  and financial performance of the institute  and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

Basis for Opinion 
       
"I conducted the audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent 
of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) that 
are relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. 
       
Other Information
        
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor's report thereon.    
    
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.        
        
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated, If, based on the work we have performed, I conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in 
this regard.
         
Responsibilities of Management and those who charged with governance for the Financial Statements  
      
"Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal controls as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with 
governance are responsible for overseeing the Institute's financial reporting process.     
   
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       
 
"My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  
        
As part of the audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. I also:        
        
    - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud and error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to prove a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, or fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omission, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

    -  Obtaining an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Institute's internal controls. 
      
    -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
      
    -  Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Institute's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion . My conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
      
    -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation. 
      
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
       
I communicate with those who charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identify 
during the audit.

 1.5 Accounting for Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) 
  APFASL has been set up jointly with the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy (IPFDA) and 
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) in 2012, to enhance the capacity of public 
sector financial management professionals. Both CA Sri Lanka and IPFDA have equally contributed Rs. 10mn 
as initial investment for this project. In terms of paragraph 5.9 of the Articles of Constitution of APFASL, on the 
occasion of dissolution, the fund will either be spent for collective welfare purposes or be granted towards any 
good cause as the general membership feels best.
  The assets and liabilities of Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) which had been 
amalgamated with the Institute financials up to year 2015 have been de- recognised from the financial statements 
of the Institute from the year 2016 due to the amendment of certain clauses and provisions of the Constitution of 
APFASL in order to operate as a more autonomous entity.
  When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all factors 
and circumstances in SLFRS 10 - “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows:
  (a) power over the investee.
  (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
  (c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
  Accordingly, Management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to variable returns 
from its involvement with APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation.
 1.6 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
 1.6.1 Statement of Compliance
  The financial statements of the Institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting 
Standards(SLFRS and LKAS)  issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
  These financial statements comprise the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in funds and reserves, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements.
  The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements unless 
otherwise stated.
 1.6.2 Basis of Measurement
  The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis and on the historical cost convention, 
except where appropriate disclosures are made with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
 1.6.3 Comparative Information
  Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in 
respect of the previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements, in order to enhance the 
understanding of the financial statements of the current period and to improve comparability.

 1.6.4 Responsibility and Approval of Financial Statements
  The Council of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka acknowledges their responsibility for 
the financial statements and financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Council at 
the meeting held on 27 March 2025.
 1.6.5 Materiality and Aggregation 
  Each material class of similar items is presented separately in the financial statements. Items of a dissimilar 
nature or function are presented separately, unless they are immaterial.
 1.6.6 Functional and Presentation Currency
  The financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Institute’s functional and 
presentation currency, in the primary economic environment in which the Institute operates.
  All financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless 
stated otherwise.
 1.7 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments
  Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The 
preparation and presentation of financial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, requires 
Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates and 
judgments used.
  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
  Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies 
that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows.
 a) Defined Benefit Plans
  The cost of the defined benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. 
Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the discount rate & future rate of salary increments. 
Due to the long-term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
 a) Estimating the Incremental Borrowing Rate
  As the Institute cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, it uses its incremental 
borrowing rate (IBR) to measure the lease liabilities. IBR is a rate of interest that a lessee would have to 
pay to borrow similar facility from a financial institution.
 c) Changes in Accounting Estimates and Judgments
  Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the 
financial statements.

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 2.1 Assets and the Bases of Their Valuation
 2.1.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
    (a) Basis of Recognition and Measurement
     Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the asset will flow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
     All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance costs are recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
    (b) Depreciation
     Depreciation is calculated by using a straight-line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, 
in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
                        The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Asset Category Useful Life
(Years)
Buildings 50
Furniture, Fittings and Fixtures 5- 10
Plant and Machinery 5-10
Motor vehicles 10
Computers 5
  Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier date that the asset is classified 
as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
  Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identified and depreciated.
  Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of the related asset.
 
  
(c) Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
   The Institute recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the 
amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
 
   The estimated useful lives of right of use assets are as follows:

<!-- page 13 -->

Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 04.04.2025
13a
Asset Category Useful Life
(Years)
Right of use asset 10
 Improvements to Right of use asset 10
 
   Depreciation of improvement to right of use asset is calculated based on the remaining lease period.
   At the commencement date of the lease the Institute recognises lease liability measured at the present 
value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, the lease payments include fixed payments 
(including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. 
The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be 
exercised by the Institute and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects 
the Institute exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index 
or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in 
which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.  
   In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Institute uses its incremental borrowing rate at 
the lease commencement date as the discount rate, because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not 
readily determinable. The Institute determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates 
from the Institute’s internal records. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the 
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, 
a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index 
or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase 
the underlying asset. 
  (d) Derecognition
   An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is 
calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included 
in the statement of comprehensive income in the year, the asset is derecognised.
 2.1.2 Library Books
  Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years.
 2.1.3 Capital Work-In-Progress
  Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital nature, 
directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-
in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it 
is available for use i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by the Institute.
 2.1.4 Intangible Assets
 (a) Computer Software
  Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and 
bring to use. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five to ten (5-10) years.

<!-- page 14 -->

Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 04.04.2025
14a
  Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as 
incurred. 
  Costs recognized as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not 
exceed ten (10) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress 
until the software is ready for use.
 (b) Study Material
  Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA 
qualifications are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new 
curriculum, the investment attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably 
measured and it can be demonstrated that it will generate probable future economic benefits.
  These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful life is 
reviewed at least at each financial reporting year end.
 
2.1.5 Inventories
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete 
and slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business 
less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on weighted 
average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their 
existing location and condition.
  The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.
 2.1.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
  The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If such an indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes 
an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the 
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of 
money and the risk specific to the asset.
  Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in 
those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
  A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the 
case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot 
“exceed” the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income.
 2.1.7 Financial Assets - Initial Recognition and Measurement
 (a) Financial Assets
  The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual 
cash flow characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With the exception 

<!-- page 15 -->

15a
of trade receivables that do not contain significant financing components for which the Institute has 
applied the practical expedient, the Institute initially measures financial assets at their fair value plus 
transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component for which 
the Institute has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under 
SlfrS 15.
  In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, 
it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal 
amount outstanding. The Institute’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it 
manages financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash 
flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows or selling financial assets or both.
  Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the Statement of 
Financial Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
  The financial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, fixed deposits held 
to collect contractual cash flows, government securities, repurchase agreements and cash and cash 
equivalents.
  The Institute’s financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of both of 
the following conditions:
 (a) The financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and
 (b) The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
  Accordingly, financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) 
method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is 
derecognised, modified or impaired.
 2.1.8 Derecognition of Financial Assets
  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised when:
 • The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
 
 • The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement and either:
 a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
 
 b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset but has transferred control of the asset.
  When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass- 
through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 

<!-- page 16 -->

Part I : Sec. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 04.04.2025
16A
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its 
continuing involvement. In that case, the Institute also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Institute has retained.
  Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower 
of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Institute 
could be required to repay.
 2.1.9 Impairment of Financial Assets
  The Institute recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments measured 
at amortized cost.
  ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract 
and all the cash flows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original 
effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or 
other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
  `For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
               A provision is made for all receivables outstanding for more than 365 days, considering recoverability. 
Government-backed student loan debts are excluded from provisioning since guarantees exist. Write-offs 
are recognized when debt is deemed irrecoverable.
 2.1.10 Reclassification
  Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the management intends to hold these instruments to 
collect the contractual cash flows upon completion of the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) 
test and evaluating the historical data. As of 1st January 2018, the Institute has elected the business model 
of hold to collect the contractual cash flows and measured the instruments at amortized cost.
  Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare 
circumstances when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such financial 
assets.
  Consequent to the change in the business model, if any, the Institute reclassifies all affected assets 
prospectively from the first day of the next reporting period (the reclassification date). Prior periods are 
not restated.
 2.1.11 Financial Liabilities
  All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss. The Institute does not have financial liabilities other than payables for the year ended 31st 
December 2024.
 2.1.12 Cash and Cash Equivalents
  The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. 
  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
  Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement 
of cash flows, which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.

17a
 2.2 Liabilities and Provisions
  A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or there is no 
unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. The 
Institute classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
 2.2.1  Deferred Income
  Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes are raised at the 
commencement of the courses where the course delivery takes place over a period of several months. 
Deferred income is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery 
taken place and the balance attributable to the remaining course period is recognized as a liability on the 
statement of financial position until income is recognized.
 2.2.2 Provisions
  A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the 
obligation and the obligation can be measured reliably.
 2.2.3 Employee Benefits
 (a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan - Gratuity
  Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan. The 
defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows, using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be 
paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an 
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions about discount rate, future salary increments and 
mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Accordingly, the employee benefit 
liability is based on the actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2024. The Institute’s accounting policy 
for gratuity is to recognise actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the 
statement of other comprehensive income.
 (b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund.
  Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund 
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognized as an expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross 
emoluments of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively.
 2.2.4 Taxation
 a) Income Tax
  The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act,  
No. 24 of 2017 and as amended subsequently by Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 45 of 2022.

18a
 (b) Deferred Taxation
  Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed 
against the liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable income. 
Deferred tax has not been provided in the financial statements.
 2.2.5 Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions
  Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates 
which approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets (including 
securities) and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at the 
rate of exchange at that date. Non - monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated 
at historical cost are translated at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realized and 
unrealized exchange differences are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
 2.3 Accounting for the Receipt and Utilization of Funds, Grants and Reserves
  The Institute received various grants for specific development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have been 
classified as unrestricted funds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
 2.3.1 Unrestricted Funds
  Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Council and 
funds that are designated for a specific purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives 
of the Institute. Allocations made by the Council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income. Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted 
funds in terms of the relevant donor agreements or with the subsequent approval of the donor.
  Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of references.
  Designated Funds
 
  Unrestricted funds designated by the Council to a specific purpose are identified as  designated funds. The Institute 
has accounted the following funds as designated funds and the purpose of such funds are elaborated as follows,

Under the Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983, gratuity liability arises only upon an employee completing a continuous service of 
five years.
14.2 Principal actuarial assumptions used 
Actuarial and Management Consultants (Pvt) Ltd., qualified actuaries carried out an actuarial valuation on the defined 
benefit plan-gratuity as at 31 December 2024. The assumptions used in determining the cost of retirement benefits are as 
follows,
Assumption 2024 2023
Discount interest rate * 10% per annum 13% per annum
Staff turnover rate 23% per annum 20% per annum
Salary increment rate 8.0% 10.0%
Retirement age 60 years 60 years
* In the absence of a deep market in long term bonds in Sri Lanka, a long term interest rate of 10% p.a ( 2023 - 13% p.a) has 
been used to discount future liabilities considering anticipated long term rate of inflation.
14.3 Sensitivity analysis
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used with all other 
variables held constant in the retirement benefit obligation measurement.

01 July 2009 to 31 December 2014 amounting to Rs. 100mn. Further, the Institute had also received an assessment in 
respect of Economic Service Charge (ESC) for the period commencing from 01 April 2009 to 31 March 2012 amounting 
to Rs. 4.5mn. The Institute had duly appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) against all the determinations of 
the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) in respect of above assessments.   
TAC has determined appeals against the assessments for ESC, V AT and NBT in favour of the CGIR. The Institute has 
appealed against the determination of the TAC and the said appeals are currently pending before the court of appeal. 
Having discussed with independent legal and tax experts and based on information available, the Institute is of the view 
that it is not liable for assessed taxes in the above assessments and therefore, no provision has been made in the financial 
statements.
