AUTHORIZATION
I do hereby grant permission to the Chief Secretary and the Accounting Oﬃ  cers of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council to 
spend a sum of Rupees Twenty One Billion Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand Only, (Rs. 21,017,500,000/-) out of

for the four months period that starts on 01st of January, 2025  and end  on 30th April, 2025,  by virtue of powers vested in 
me  under Section  27 (a)  of the Provincial Council Act No. 42 of  1987,  as the term of the 06th Sabaragamuwa Provincial 
Council of the Democratic Socialist Republic of  Sri Lanka ended on  26th September, 2017.

07th Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council  or  from the date  re-sta rts the functions of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council  
which occurs ﬁ rst.
Since the Provincial Council has not yet received the details of the Tresury grants and the revenue targets required to prepare 
the Annual Financial Statement and Revenue and Expenditure Estimates for the year 2025, this estimate has been prepared 
in the form of vote on account. As these estimates have been prepared in the expectation that the grants and revenue targets 
for these expenses will be provided by the Treasury in the futu re, I limit this authorization to incur expenses only upto the 
maximum of the revenue collected and provided by the Treasury for the ﬁ rst four months of the year 2025.
