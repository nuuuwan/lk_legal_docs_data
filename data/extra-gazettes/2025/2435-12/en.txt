 ● All colleagues will be encouraged to expand and give their best in their role.
  
 ● Increased focus on learning, so that colleagues can grow themselves in their current role and develop their careers 
in the Bank, acquiring new skills for the future of work.
 ● More recognition, enabling colleagues to show appreciation to one another and feel appreciated for their efforts.
 ● All colleagues will feel safe to innovate (through taking measured risks) and incentivised to collaborate.
 ● Colleagues will have a better understanding of their skills and abilities, both for their current roles and the roles 
to which they aspire in the future.

The	goal	setting	process	will	transform	from	the	existing	annual	objective-setting	processes	with	separate	valued	behaviour	
content to process where employees will be able to set:
 ● Activities	(short-term	objectives);
 ● Goals / Scorecards (as applicable), visible to all; and
 ● Aspirational Goals
In the current continuous performance management, the ratings awarded by People Leaders and calibrated by management 
teams based on valued behaviours (A to E) and performance (1 to 5) will be transformed into system of:
 ● No	ratings	(simplified	approach).	Performance	viewed	on	a	continuum	from	high	to	low	more	holistically	through	
regular performance check-ins throughout the year with conversations focused on development.
 ● The colleagues with highest relative performance would be awarded higher variable remuneration and relative 
under performers would receive a lower variable remuneration. Underperformers could receive no variable pay.
 ● There would be regular performance check-ins by People Leaders to discuss what’s going well and areas for 
development.
In	the	new	performance	management	process,	an	objective	talent	identification	and	measurement	tool,	complemented	by	
360	feedback	will	be	used	instead	of	Subjective	definition	and	measurement	of	talent	(9	Box).
Currently, the employee recognition is steered through Multiple different recognition programmes such as ‘Simply Thank 
You’ and ‘Going the Extra Mile’ with limited usage. However, in the new performance management process, there will be:
 ● Global recognition framework, with clear principles to guide how recognition is used and managed across the 
Bank.
 Global technology platform to facilitate recognition being given to/from any colleague.Variety of recognition 
options wherein colleagues can receive points redeemable for products/experiences of their choice from the menu 
available	in	the	newly	launched	“Appreciate”	portal.	In	the	new	performance	management	process,	the	employee	
will receive both quantitative and quantitative 360 feedback, enabled by technology and broaden access to 
coaching and mentoring offerings via virtual and Al driven tools to support colleagues development needs.
Any further changes to the performance management model, will be discussed and agreed by both parties at the next 
collective agreement.
 III Forfeiture of Variable Pay
  In order to maintain our pay for performance culture while increasing the focus on Group/
business performance outcomes to foster greater innovation and collaboration, the variable 
pay will apply in the range of 7%-10% at the management discretion. Evaluation will be 
for preceding year and payments will be made in the succeeding year for the duration 
of this agreement, as stipulated in Clause 8 (1). However, the employee’s variable pay 
will be differed or suspended or stopped or forfeited on account of employees with risk 
and conduct issues of Medium or High severity including any disciplinary sanctions and

for underperformances. The process will be guided by the Group Regulation on Variable 
Compensation Policy. The underperformers will be receiving continuous feedback from 
the management throughout the year starting from January to December. Based on the 
evaluation conducted by the management in December of every year, if an employee 
is	identified	as	an	underperformer,	the	variable	pay	will	be	deferred.	Employees	are	
responsible to set goals after discussing with the people leader and responsible to achieve 
their	set	goals.	If	the	required	goals	are	unachieved,	it	is	a	definite	indication	that	the	
employees will be considered as underperformer at the end of each year.
  Provided however, an employee’s basic salary on receiving such an increase will not exceed 
the maximum salary point set out in the salary range in schedule 1 hereto. In the event of an 
employee reaching the maximum salary point on the range, the amount of increase granted 
over and above the maximum salary point will be paid as an annual lump sum bonus. The 
calculation for this payment will be the amount in excess of the maximum salary point on 
the range, as per the increase granted, multiplied by twelve. This lump sum bonus shall not 
attract	any	consequential	benefits	such	as	overtime,	terminal	benefits,	statutory	dues	etc.
9. Grading Structure._ Those covered and bound by this agreement are employees at Grade 10.
   10. Promotions._ Without	prejudice	to	the	right	of	the	Bank	to	recruit	staff	at	their	discretion	into	any	job	grade,	
the	Bank	will	consider	suitable	employees	for	promotions	to	higher	job	grades,	based	upon	the	Bank’s	needs	and	vacancies	
that	may	arise	from	time	to	time.	The	decision	of	the	bank	in	respect	of	selection	for	promotion	shall	be	final	and	conclusive	
Consideration	will	be	given	to	performance,	qualifications,	experience,	and	merit	when	selections	are	made.	A	minimum	
increase	of	5%	of	basic	salary	will	be	granted	when	being	promoted	to	a	higher	grade,	in	addition	to	the	Variable	Pay	subject	
to the provisions and conditions in Clause 8 (III)

their	own	applications	for	consideration.	Vacancies	will	be	filled	with	existing	staff	wherever	possible,	however	if	applicants
