The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 
 
     No Changes 
 
LKAS 1 -  Presentation of Financial Statements 
 
139Q [This paragraph refers to amendments that are not yet effective, and is therefore not 
included in this edition.] 
 
  
LKAS 2 -  Inventories 
 
40G [This paragraph refers to amendments that are not yet effective, and is therefore not 
included in this edition.] 
 
 
LKAS 7 -  Statement of Cash Flow 
 
44A Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities 
An entity shall provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to 
evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both 
changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. 
 
44B To the extent necessary to satisfy the requirement in paragraph 44A, an entity shall disclose 
the following changes in liabilities arising from financing activities: 
 
(a) changes from financing cash flows; 
 
(b) changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses; 
 
(c) the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates; 
 
(d) changes in fair values; and 
 
(e) other changes. 
 
44C Liabilities arising from financing activities are liabilities for which cash flows were, or 
future cash flows will be, classified in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from 
financing activities. In addition, the disclosure requirement in paragraph 44A also applies 
to changes in financial assets (for exa mple, assets that hedge liabilities arising from 
financing activities) if cash flows from those financial assets were, or future cash flows 
will be, included in cash flows from financing activities. 
 
44D One way to fulfil the disclosure requirement in paragraph 44A is by providing a 
reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial 
position for liabilities arising from financing activities, including the changes identified in 
paragraph 44B. Where an entity discloses such a reconciliation, it shall provide sufficient 
information to enable users of the financial statements to link items included in the 
reconciliation to the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows. 
 
44E If an entity provides the disclosure required by paragraph 44A in combination with 
disclosures of changes in other assets and liabilities, it shall disclose the changes in 
liabilities arising from financing activities separately from chang es in those other assets 
and liabilities. 
 
59 [This paragraph refers to amendments that are not yet effective, and is therefore not 
included in this edition.] 
 
60 Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to LKAS 7), issued in September 2016, added 
paragraphs 44A –44E. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods

beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is permitted. When the entity first 
applies those amendments, it is not required to provide comparative information for 
preceding periods.

26 Example illustrating paragraph 26(d) 
 
Identification of a deductible temporary difference at the end of Year 2:  
 
Entity A purchases for CU1,000, at the beginning of Year 1, a debt instrument with a 
nominal value of CU1,000 payable on maturity in 5 years with an interest rate of 2% payable 
at the end of each year. The effective interest rate is 2%. The debt instrument is measured 
at fair value. 
 
At the end of Year 2, the fair va lue of the debt instrument has decreased to CU918 as a 
result of an increase in market interest rates to 5%. It is probable that Entity A will collect 
all the contractual cash flows if it continues to hold the debt instrument. 
 
Any gains (losses) on the debt instrument are taxable (deductible) only when realised. The 
gains (losses) arising on the sale or maturity of the debt instrument are calculated for tax 
purposes as the difference between the amount collected and the original cost of the debt 
instrument. 
 
Accordingly, the tax base of the debt instrument is its original cost. 
 
The difference between the carrying amount of the debt instrument in Entity A’s statement 
of financial position of CU918 and its tax base of CU1,000 gives rise to a deductible 
temporary difference of CU82 at the end of Year 2 (see paragraphs 20 and 26(d)), 
irrespective of whether Entity A expects to recover the carrying amount of the debt 
instrument by sale or by use, ie by holding it and collecting contractual cash flows, or a 
combination of both. 
 
This is because deductible temporary differences are differences between the carrying 
amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base that 
will result in amounts that are deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future 
periods, when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled (see 
paragraph 5). Entity A obtains a deduction equivalent to the tax base of the asset of 
CU1,000 in determining taxable profit (tax loss) either on sale or on maturity.

6A  I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2017'02'22 
 PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 22.02.2017  
27A When an entity assesses whether taxable profits will be available against which it can utilise 
a deductible temporary difference, it considers whether tax law restricts the sources of 
taxable profits against which it may make deductions on the reversal of that deductible 
temporary difference. If tax law imposes no such restrictions, an entity assesses a deductible 
temporary difference in combination with all of its other deductible temporary differences. 
However, if tax law restricts the utilisation of losses to deduction against income of a 
specific type, a deductible temporary difference is assessed in combination only with other 
deductible temporary differences of the appropriate type. 
 
29 When there are insufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation 
authority and the same taxable entity, the deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that: 
 
(a) it is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit relating to the same 
taxation authority and the same taxable entity in the same period as the reversal of the 
deductible temporary difference (or in the peri ods into which a tax loss arising from 
the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward). In evaluating whether it will 
have sufficient taxable profit in future periods, an entity:  
(i) compares the deductible temporary differences with future taxable  profit that 
excludes tax deductions resulting from the reversal of those deductible 
temporary differences. This comparison shows the extent to which the future 
taxable profit is sufficient for the entity to deduct the amounts resulting from the 
reversal of those deductible temporary differences; and 
(ii) ignores taxable amounts arising from deductible temporary differences that are 
expected to originate in future periods, because the deferred tax asset arising 
from these deductible temporary differences will itself require future taxable 
profit in order to be utilised; or 
 
(b) tax planning opportunities are available to the entity that will create taxable profit in 
appropriate periods. 
29A The estimate of probable future taxable profit may include the recovery of some of an 
entity’s assets for more than their carrying amount if there is sufficient evidence that it is 
probable that the entity will achieve this. For example, when an asset is measured at fair 
value, the entity shall consider whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that it is 
probable that the entity will recover the asset for more than its carrying amount. This may 
be the case, for example, when an entity expects to hold a fixed -rate debt instrument and 
collect the contractual cash flows. 
 
98G 
 
Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrea lised Losses (Amendments to LKAS 12), 
issued in September 2016, amended paragraph 29 and added paragraphs 27A, 29A and the 
example following paragraph 26. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earli er application is permitted. If an entity 
applies those amendments for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact. An entity shall 
apply those amendments retrospectively in accordance with LKAS 8 Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and  Errors. However, on initial application of the 
amendment, the change in the opening equity of the earliest comparative period may be 
recognised in opening retained earnings (or in another component of equity, as appropriate), 
without allocating the change between opening retained earnings and other components of 
equity. If an entity applies this relief, it shall disclose that fact.
