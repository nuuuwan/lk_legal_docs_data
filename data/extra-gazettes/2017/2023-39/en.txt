When Sathosa Retail Limited had to close down. Lanka Sathosa Limited was set up to carry on the business and to provide
jobs to its work force.
Sathosa Retail employees were given the option of a generous VRS or continuity of service with Lanka Sathosa Limited.
This was promised by the Hon. Minister as well as the Chairman of Lanka Sathosa Limited.
However Lanka Sathosa Limited did not include a such a clause in the contract of employment, and instead fraudulently
tried to place employees on contract, probation etc. The employees protested and sent numerous written communications as
well. (e.g. A11 - A14)
The Minister and Chairman agreed that continuity of service was promised.

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE  DEMOCRA TIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC  OF  SRI  LANKA - 14.06.2017
The Respondent has suppressed and / or not summoned the witnesses with personal knowledge (Chairman Nihal
Jayawardena and Yasantha Kodagoda, Consultant) and only produced witnesses who were not present at the meetings held
with the Chairman and Hon. Minister at the time the employees decided not to accept the VRS and to join the Respondent in
view of the continuity of servie promised.
As such, the Respondent failed to rebut the Complainant's evidence.
Additionally the evidence of Priyal Perera (Respondent's first witness) was demonstrably evasive and false and contradicted
by the Respondent's second witness, Vyjanthji Mala.
The Respondents in their written submission stated as follows.
Respondents stated that it is improbable to ascertain or claim either in law or in equity that any previous employment with
any other legal person could be considered, in any manner to be continuity of employment, whatsoever either reasonably
and / or justifiably, in law, including the Applicant Respondent employee and or for that matter, any other employee of either
CWE and/or Sathosa Retail Limited.
An overall analysis of evidence I have come to following conclusions.
i. Employees of Sathosa Retail Limited were given an option of benefits from a V oluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) or
obtaining employment in Lanka Sathosa Limited with continuity service.
ii. Both the Chairman of Lanka Sathosa Limited and Minister in charge as promised continuity of service to the employees
who opted to join Lanka Sathosa Limited instead of accepting VRS.
iii. It was in Respondent annual Report for the financial years 2005 - 2006 (A8) as follows.
"The employees who had lost their employment after the cessation of the "Sathosa Retail Limited" have been
absorbed to the cadre of Lanka Sathosa Limited, fulfilling one of the primary objectives of setting up of the Lanka
Sathosa Limited." (A8a)
"Lanka Sathosa Limited has played a vital role in reducing the burden of inflation on common people and has
secured the jobs of Sathosa Retail employees which has relieved the government of the financial and political stigma.
(A8c)
"The staff taken at the initial stage was the employees who didn't opted for the VRS scheme offered by the Sathosa
Retail Limited, at the time of their closure." (A8b)
"......the primary objective of restructuring as 'providing and efficient commodity retails trading service to the
consumer public and ...... providing continued employment to an optimal number of employees of Sathosa Retail
Limited,"
The Respondent has acted maliciously towards the applicants giving various promises as aforesaid for the continuity of
the service of their employment when they joined Lanka Sathosa Limited. But failed to keep their promises.
The Respondent has acted maliciously towards applicants by creating them an expectations when they joined the Respondent
Company promising them continuity of service and denying them all the perks such as salary increments and other incentives
if they were granted continuity of their employment.
In the circumstances. I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs, Edirisinghe (1991)
that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable; he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the contract
or employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect of the award is to
introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbirator creates a new

contract for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract. An industrial
arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force in the future when he cannot get the
parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the Respondent Company (party of the second part) has caused injustice to
the applicant. (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the First
part.
(a) Be amalgamate the period of earlier service at Sathosa Retail Limited to the period of service of Lanka Sathosa Limited
of the 495 employees (as per the annexure)
(b) Be paid any increments, statutory allowances which were entitled by 495 employees during the period in which the
continuty service was denied to them.
I further make order that this award should be implemented within 21 days of the publication in the Government Gazette of
the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award just and equitable.
