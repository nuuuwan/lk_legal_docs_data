PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE DEMOCRATIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC  OF  SRI  LANKA - 03.03.2017
An overall analysis of evidence I have come to following
conclusions.
I. The Respondent Company has acted maliciously
towards the applicant by asking him to work for
Trinity Logistics and Pership Integrated Solution
while employed by Asha Shipping Company and
denying him extra payment.
II. The Respondent Company has acted malice towards
applicant by not paying additional allowance for the
services tendered to Trinity Logistics (Earlier
Freightship Shipping (Pvt) Ltd) and Pership
Integrated Solutions (Pvt) Ltd and where as other
employees. Eg : Ebert and Shyamali was paid
additional allowance for the extra works.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision
of the Supreme Court in State Bank of India vs. Edirisinghe
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make and award which is
just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the
terms of the contract to employment. He can create new
rights and introduce new obligations between the parties.
The effect of the award is to introduce terms which become
implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as
industrial arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in
contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising
out an existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles
disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come
into force in the future when he cannot get the parties to
agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the
existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the
Respondent Company (party of the second part) has caused
injustice to the applicant (party of the First part).
in the circumstances taking into consideration the totality
of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the
First part. Be paid an allowance for the additional work
performed for Trinity Logistics (Pvt) Ltd and Pership
Integrated Solution (Pvt) Ltd for the period 2002 July to
2010 March computed Rs. 10,000 per month total of 93
months - Rupees Nine Hundred and Thirty Thousand Only
(Rs. 930,000).
And the aforesaid money should be deposited by the Party
of the Second Part at the office of the Colombo East Labour
Commissioner.
I, further make order that this award should be
implemented within 21 days of the publication in the
Government Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award just and equitable.
