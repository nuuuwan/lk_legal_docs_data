in him by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, Chapter
131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised
Edition), as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957, 4 of 1962
and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial Disputes (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968 appointed me as the
Arbitrator and referred the aforesaid dispute to me for
settlement by arbitration.
Statement of the matter in dispute
“Whether the monthly salary of Mr. P . D.
Samarasinghe who served as Chief Executive
(Operations) of Richard Pieris and Company PLC has
been reduced from Rs. 850,000/- to Rs. 600,000/- with
effect from November 2008 and if so, what relief he is
entitled to.”
Appearances :
For the party of the 1st part Mr. Avindra Rodrigo, Senior
Counsel along with Ms. Rozali Fernando, Attorney-at-Law
appears for the Party of the 1st Part. Party of the 1st part,
Pravir Danoush Samarasinghe is present.

Ganashathasan, Attorney-at-Law appeared on behalf of the
Party of the second part, Mr. Shiron Goonaratne, Group
Chief Financial Officer is present on behalf of the Party of
the 2nd part with Ms. Namali Kuruppu, Attorney-at-Law,
Legal Officer of the Party of the 2nd Part.
After both parties mentioned above have submitted
their respective statements that has led to the dispute in
terms of Regulation 21(1) and 21(2) of the Industrial
Disputes Regulations of 1958.
In fact is noted in the absence of an English competent
stenographer the above said parties hired an individual
English stenographer and they both shared the expenses
including these proceedings and this Award.
In fact, at the outset I made an endeavour to explore
the possibility of an amicable settlement but it proved futile.
The Party of the 2nd Part was ordered to commence
proceedings by the Court and while the Party of the 1st Part
was under cross examination the Court once again suggested
a proposal to settle the matter and which was offered to
them on 3rd July 2017. To make a long story short this
proposal had been accepted and acted upon by them and the
terms of settlement were entered into on 24th July 2017
and the said settlement scheme was recorded, as detailed
hereunder.
The terms of settlement that had been agreed between parties
are :-
1. The Party of the 2nd Part (Richard Pieris Company
PLC), shall pay to the Party of the First Part (Pravir
D. Samarasinghe) a sum of Rupees Seven Million
Five Hundred Thousand (Rs. 7,500,000) by cheque
bearing No. 706871 dated 2nd August 2017 drawn
on the National Development Bank as an amicable
settlement.
2. The Party of the 1st Part will bear the tax liability  (if
any) for the said amount. The Party of the 1st Part
agrees to indemnify the Party of the 2nd Part if any
order is made against the Party of the 2nd Part
requiring the Party of the 2nd Part to pay tax on the
said amount of Rupees Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand (Rs. 7,500,000).
3. The Party of the 1st Part accepts the above mentioned
payment as a full and final settlement of the matters
before the Hon. Arbitrator in the industrial arbitration
in Case No. A3619 and confirms that all payments
will include EPF, ETF and gratuity arising from and
during the period of his employment with the Party
of the 2nd Part, i.e. “from 1st March 1991 to 10th
March 2011” has been paid and settled in full and
specifically agrees that he is not entitled to any other
payment or additional/increased EPF/ETF granted
from and during the said period of his employment,
subject to the realization of the cheque referred to
above.
4. The Party of the 1st Part agrees not to make any claim
against the Party of the 2nd Part or any officers,
agents or subsidiaries of the Party of the 2nd Part in
respect of the matters referred to the Hon. Arbitrator
in industrial dispute in Case No. 3619 including any
action on the alleged contempt of Court on the Hon.
Tribunal arising out of the industrial arbitration in
Case No. A 3619.
5.  Both parties agree to maintain strict confidentiality
of the terms of the settlement.
6. The parties agree that industrial arbitration in Case
No. A 3619 be concluded upon the realization of the
aforementioned cheque.

7. The Hon. Arbitrator notes that the cheque brought
before the Tribunal today bears only one signature.
The Group Chief Financial Officer of the Party of the 2nd
Part states that this cheque is made in terms of a mandate
given to the Party of the 2nd Part in making payments of
special transactions which require confidentiality and the
Party of the 2nd Part has sought and obtained a mandate
from the particular Bank which permits one signature alone
to be made in execution of such a cheque.
On that basis the Party of the 1st Part has no objection.
8. The Party of the 1st Part has given draft terms and
conditions which parties have signed today
(24.07.2017).
9. In the presence of all parties the Arbitrator hands
over the cheque from the Party of the 2nd Part to the
Party of the 1st Part. The Party of the 1st Part signed
the draft terms and accepted the cheque. A copy of
the draft terms signed by all parties is given to the
parties. One copy is filed of record.
PRINTED A T THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING , SRI LANKA
And as such this matter was called for the
confirmation and to check the realization of the above said
cheque of Rs. 7,500,000/- . It was confirmed by the Hatton
National Bank by their letter dated 8th August 2017 and a
copy is filed of record and when this matter was called on
11.08.2017 (today) and I having satisfied that the terms and
condition made by both parties had been comprehensively
obligated and settled I do not stand in their way.
In the circumstances I make order that the above
said settlement between the parties having honored in the
true spirit and settled in full and I make the award
accordingly.
In the premises I consider that the above the said
settlement award is just and equitable in the circumstances.
