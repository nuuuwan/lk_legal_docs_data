Amendments to LKAS 40 Investment Property - effective from 01st January 2018 
 
Transfers of Investment Property 
Amendments to LKAS 40 Investment Property  
 
Paragraphs 57–58 are amended. Deleted text is struck through and new text is underlined.   
 
Transfers  
 
57  Transfers An entity shall transfer a property  to, or from, investment property shall be made  when, 
and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by. A change in use occurs when the property meets, 
or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use. In 
isolation, a change in management’s intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of 
a change in use. Examples of evidence of a change in use include:  
 
(a) commencement of owner -occupation, or of development with a  view to owner -occupation, for a 
transfer from investment property  to owner-occupied property;  
 
(b)  commencement of development with a view to sale, for a transfer  from investment property to 
inventories;  
 
(c)  end of owner -occupation, for a transfer from owner -occupied  property to investment property; 
or and  
 
(d)  commencement inception of an operating lease to  another party,  for a transfer from inventories 
to investment property.  
 
 (e) [deleted]  
 
58  Paragraph 57(b) requires an entity to transfer a property from investment  property to inventories when, 
and only when, there is a change in use,  evidenced by commencement of development with a view to 
sale. When an entity decides to dispose of an investment property without development, it continues to 
treat the property as an investment property until it is derecognised (eliminated from the statement of 
financial position) and does not treat reclassify it as inventory. Similarly, if an entity begins to redevelop 
an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an 
investment property and is not reclassified as owner-occupied property during the redevelopment.  
 
Paragraphs 84C–84E and their related heading, and paragraph 85G, are added.   
 
Transitional provisions

beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendments (the date of initial 
application). At the date of initial application, an entity shall reassess the classification of property held at

that date and, if applicable, reclassify property applying paragraphs 7–14 to reflect the conditions that exist 
at that date.  
 
84D  Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph 84C, an entity is permitted to apply the amendments to

entity shall:  
 
(a) account for the reclassification applying the requirements in paragraphs  59 –64. In applying 
paragraphs 59–64, an entity shall:  
 
(i) read any reference to the date of change in use as the date of  initial application; and  
 
(ii) recognise any amount that, in accordance with paragraphs  59 –64, would have been recognised 
in profit or loss as an  adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the  date of 
initial application.  
 
(b)  disclose the amounts reclassified to, or from, investment property in  accordance with paragraph 
84C. The entity shall disclose those amounts reclassified as part of the reconciliation of the carrying 
amount of investment property at the beginning and end of the period as required by paragraphs 76 
and 79.  
 
Effective date
