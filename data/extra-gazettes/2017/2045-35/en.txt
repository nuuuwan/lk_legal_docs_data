Athukorala and Foreman I. M. Gamini.
Representatives from Human Resources Division were
presents in addition, who had no technical knowledge on
the subject.
Besides, at this inquiry management failed to present any
of the said technically qualified, personnel, who conducted
the Trade Tests.
b) The applicant at the Trade Test held on 08th December
2009 scored 60 marks, while the other two
candidates scored 47 and 48 marks.
At the Trade Test held on 11th June 2010, applicant
scored 65 marks, while the other two candidates
scored 55 and 60 marks.
PRINTED A T THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING , SRI LANKA
On both occasion, the applicant received higher
marks.
c) Although at Trade Tests, representatives of Human
Resources Division were present, failed to sign or
inform in writing to the Senior as to why the results
sheets were not singed - evidence of Niyas Ahamadu
Munas reveals, Human Resources Division officials
only gave evidence.
d) As from 08th June 2011, applicant was required to
cover up the work of Senior Technician
(Instrumental) which he is now requesting to
regularize the position.
AWARD
I have examined the evidence tendered comprehensively
and are satisfied that the applicant is eminently qualified
and satisfied the selection criteria. In the circumstances I
award that the applicant be appointed to the post of Senior
Technician (Instruments) Grade I, with retrospective effect
from of December 2009 and be paid arrears of salary due
within 45 days, of publication of this award in the Govt.
Gazette. This is just and a fair award.
