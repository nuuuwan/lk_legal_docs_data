Statement of Alternative Treatment (SoAT) on the Figures in the Interim Financial Statements
Preface
The Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting is applicable if an entity is required or elects to
publish an interim financial report in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRSs). In terms of paragraph
19 of LKAS 34, an interim financial report shall not be described as complying with SLFRSs unless it complies with all the
requirements of SLFRSs.
The Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 01
st
January 2018. Accordingly, in reporting the interim results, the entities are required to apply SLFRS 9 and to be in compliance
with the same. However, paragraph 7.2.16 of SLFRS 9 permits an entity not to apply the requirements of this Standard to
interim periods prior to the date of initial application, if it is impracticable.
The Accounting Standards Committee has received several requests from many entities for a relief in the interim financial
statements during the first financial year commencing on or after 01
st January 2018 which will provide additional time horizon
for the smooth implementation of SLFRS 9. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) has had
continuous dialogues between the regulators as well in this regard, since issuance of the first phase of this Accounting
Standard in end 2012.
Recommendation
CA Sri Lanka has decided to grant the option to prepare the interim financial statements continuing the application of LKAS
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with disclosures on impact to the Statement of Comprehensive
Income for the period if SLFRS 9 has been applied during the financial year commencing on or after 01
st January 2018. If that
determination of impact is impracticable, that fact shall be disclosed.
Accordingly, entities may decide to apply the exemption stated in paragraph 7.2.16 of SLFRS 9 for the comparative figures in
the interim financial statements during the financial year commencing on or after 01st January 2018.
However, the entities are required to apply SLFRS 9 in the preparation of financial statements for the annual periods
beginning on or after 01st January 2018.
