5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to

Article 7
Business Profits
1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on
business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on
business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable
to that permanent establishment.
2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other
Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to
that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise
engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the
enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred
for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses
so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction
shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the
permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar
payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for
management, or except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment.
Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged
(otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise
or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or
by way of commission for specific services performed or for management or except in the case of a banking enterprise by
way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.
4. In so far as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent
establishment on the basis of an apportiontment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph
2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be
customary; the method of  apportionments adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the
principles contained in this Article.
5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment
of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.
6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be
determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

Contracting State from the operation of ships in international traffic may be taxed in the first-mentioned State, but the tax so
charged shall be reduced by an amount equal to 50 per cent thereof.
3. The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an
international operating agency, but only to so much of the profits so derived as is attributable to the participant in proportion
to its share in the joint operation.
Article 9

(a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an
enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting
State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which
differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those
conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have  not so accrued, may be included
in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.
2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that state-and taxes accordingly - profits on which an
enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits
which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had
been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate
adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits, where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In
determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities
of the Contracting States shall if neccessary consult each other.
Article 10
Dividends
1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may
be taxed in that other State.

Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.
3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt claims, participating

Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident,
through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services, from a
fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such
permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other  Contracting
State, that other state may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are
paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively
connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed
profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly
or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.
Article 11
Interest
1. Interest arising in a  Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other  Contracting State may be taxed in that Other
State.

exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a  Contracting State  and paid to a resident of the other

agency or instrumentality (including a financial institution) wholly or mainly owned by that Government;

or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a  Contracting State  when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the
person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a  Contracting State  or not, has in a  Contracting State  a permanent
establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such
interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in
which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some
other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which

exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.
3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any knid received as a consideration for the use of, or the
right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, and films or tapes for television
or radio broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to
use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.
4. The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties being a resident of a
Contracting state, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent
establishment situated therein, or performs in that other state independent personal services from a fixed base situated
therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent
establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that state. Where, however, the
person paying such royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State permanent
establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are
borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the
permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some

Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family
responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.
