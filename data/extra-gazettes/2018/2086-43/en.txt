Report of the Auditor General :–    Review Report on the Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as at 31st July, 2018
I have reviewed the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) as at 31st Ju ly, 2018.  This Balance Sheet is the Responsibility of the Management of the Central Bank of Sri Lan ka.
My responsibility is to issue a report on this Balance Sheet based on my review.
I conducted my review in accordance with Sri Lanka Standards on Review Engagements 2400 applicable to Review Engagements. This standard requires that the review should be planned and performed to obtain
moderate assurance as to whether the Balance Sheet is free of material misstatements. The review is limited primarily to inquiries of personnel of the CBSL and analytical procedures applied to financial data and
thus provide less assurance than an audit.
Based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the accompanying  Balance Sheet does not give a true and fair view.

Auditor General.
