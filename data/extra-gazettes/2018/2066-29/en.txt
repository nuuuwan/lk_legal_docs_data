FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  31ST  DECEMBER  2017
To the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka
Report on the Financial Statements
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, (‘the Institute’),
which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31st December 2017, and the statement of comprehensive
income, statement of changes in funds and reserves and, statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. I have also audited the statements of financial position
of F.B. Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st December 2017.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in
accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan

and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit
opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Institute, F.B. Lander Prize
Fund and Cyril E. Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st December, 2017 and of its financial performance and cash flows
for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

1.8 Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation and presentation of financial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards,
requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about significant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies
that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is as follows.
a) Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) and Accounting for Association of Public
Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL)
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all
factors and circumstances in SLFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows;
(a) power over the investee
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Accordingly, management has determined that there is no requirement for consolidation.
b) Defined benefit plans
The cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC)
method. Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase and
retirement age. Due to the long term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
c) Changes in accounting estimates and judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial
statements.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies
2.1 Assets and the bases of their valuation
2.1.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Basis of recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the asset will flow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured
reliably.
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are

12A
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying value of property,
plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable.
(b) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight line method on the cost of all property, plant and
equipment, in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows;
Asset category Useful life
Buildings 50 years
Furniture 5- 10 years
Plant and Machinery 5-10 years
Motor vehicles 10 years
Computers 5 years
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date
that the asset is classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately
identified and depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to
the statement of comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the
useful life of the related asset.
(c) Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition
of the asset is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount and included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year, the asset is
derecognised.
2.1.2 Library books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight line basis over a period of three years.
2.1.3 Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital
nature, directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation.
Capital work-in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and
equipment, when it is available for use  i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to
be capable of operating in the manner intended by the Institute.

2.1.4 Intangible  assets
a. Computer software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire
and bring to use. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five (5) years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense
as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following
criteria are met:
1. it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for
use;
2. management intends to complete the software product and use it;
3. there is an ability to use the software product;
4. it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic
benefits;
5. adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use
the software product are available; and
6. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably
measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognised as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do
not exceed five (5) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work
in progress until the software is ready for use.
b. Study material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the
CA qualifications are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement
the new curriculum, the investment attributable to the project during its development period can
be reliably measured and it can be demonstrated that it will generate probable future economic
benefits.
These costs are amortised over the effective period of the new curriculum and the remaining
useful life is reviewed at least at each financial reporting year end.
2.1.5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for
obsolete and slow moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories
is based on weighted average cost. The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories
and bringing them to their existing location and condition.

14A
The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and
consumables.
2.1.6 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If such indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes
an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of
assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount rate that reflects current market
assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates
used to determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If
that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased
amount cannot “exceed” the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income.
2.1.7 Financial assets – Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of LKAS 39, are classified as financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss,loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets,
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Institute
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of assets not at fair value
through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Institute initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated.
All other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised
initially on the trade date at which the Institute becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Institute has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to
settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The financial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, Held-to-Maturity
Financial Assets, Available-for-sale Financial Assets,repurchase agreements and cash and cash
equivalents.
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less

<!-- page 15 -->

15A
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included
in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs.
Initially, loans and receivables are recognised on the date that they are originated. Loans and
receivables are stated at their cost net of an allowance on outstanding amounts to cover the risk
of non-payment.
Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, employee loans and advances, deposits and
other receivables.
(b) Held-To-Maturity Financial Assets (HTM)
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are
classified as HTMwhen the Institute has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity.
After initial measurement, HTM investments are measured at amortised cost,using the Effective
Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income
in the statement of comprehensive income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised
in the statement of comprehensive income in financial costs.
Investments in fixed deposits and Government securities have been classified under HTM
investments.
(c) Available-For-Sale Financial Assets(AFS)
AFS financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as AFS or are not
classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition,
they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses are recognised
in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in funds and reserves.
Interest income on AFSfinancial assets is calculated using theEffective Interest Rate method
(EIR) and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When an investment is
derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in funds and reserves is reclassified to profit or loss.
Investments in Government securities have been classified under AFS investments.
2.1.8 Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is derecognised when:
(a) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired
(b) the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either
i) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
ii) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of the
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

<!-- page 16 -->

I fldgi ( ^ I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2018'04'11
PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI  LANKA 11.04.2018
16A
When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has
entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of it, the asset is
recognised to the extent of the Institute’s continuing involvement in it.
In that case, the Institute also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and
the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that
the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is
measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount
of consideration that the Institute could be required to repay.
2.1.9 Impairment of financial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and if such impairment has occurred, that amount of
impairment is calculated by taking the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present
value of estimated future cash flows.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the
asset or assets (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash
flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing
significant financial difficulty or default in interest or principal payments, the probability that they
will enter bankruptcy or any financial reorganisation and when observable data indicate that there is a
measurable decrease in future cash flows, such as change in arrears or economic conditions that
correlate with defaults. If any indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is then recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. An impairment
loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount,
but only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
2.1.10 Cash and cash equivalents
The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayable
on demand and form an integral part of the Institute’s cash management are included as a component of
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand,cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase
agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement
of cash flows, which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.

17A
2.2 Liabilities and provisions
A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held
primarily for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or
there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period. The institute classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
2.2.1 Financial liabilities
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are stated at amortised cost with any difference
between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the
period of the loan on an effective interest basis.
Interest-free loans are recorded at fair value on initial recognition, which is the present value of the expected
future cash flows, discounted using a market related rate. The difference between the cost and the fair value
of these loans on initial recognition has been recognised immediately as interest income while the
corresponding unamortised interest expenditure recognised in the statement of financial position, has been
amortised over the period of the loan.
2.2.2 Deferred income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes  are raised  at the
commencement of the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months.  Deferred
income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken place
and the balance attributable to the remaining course period is recognised as a liability on the statement of
financial position until income is recognised.
2.2.3 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the
obligation and the obligation can be measured reliably.
2.2.3.1 Employee benefits
(a) Employee defined benefit plan - Gratuity
Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan.
The defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC)
method.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows, using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related
liability. The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that
are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions about discount rate, future
salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates
are subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based on the actuarial valuation as of 31
stDecember
2017. The Institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognise actuarial gains and losses in
the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive income.

18A
(b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust  Fund
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognised as an expense
in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of
gross emoluments of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
respectively.
2.2.4 Taxation
a) Income tax
The surplus and income of the Institute, other than surplus and income from dividends or interest,is
exempt from income tax under Section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland RevenueAct, No.10 of 2006.
b) Other taxes
V AT has been paid in respect of rent received by the Institute, letting of movable or immovable property,
being the only taxable activity carried on by the Institute. Since the Institute is not engaged in carrying
on a trade or a business, the Institute is not liable for Economic Service Charge or Nation Building Tax.
Therefore, no provision has been made for any other taxes.
c) Deferred taxation
Provision has not been made for deferred tax, as surplus and income of the Institute other than income
from dividends or interest are exempt from income tax under section 7(b) (ii) of the Inland Revenue
Act, No. 10 of 2006.
2.2.5 Translation of foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates which
approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date,  monetary assets (including
securities) and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate
of exchange at that date. Non - monetary assets  and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated at historical
cost are translated at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realised and unrealised exchange
differences are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.3 Accounting for the receipt and utilisation of funds, grants and reserves
The Institute received various grants for specific development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have been
classified as unrestrictedfunds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
2.3.1 Unrestricted funds
Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Counciland
funds that are designated for a specific purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives of the
Institute.Allocations made by the council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the statement
of comprehensive income.Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted funds in terms
of the relevant donor agreements or with the subsequent approval of the donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of references.

2.3.4 Grants and subsidies
2.3.4.1 Revenue grants
Grants and subsidies are recognised in the financial statements at their fair value. When the grant or
subsidy relates to an expense it is recognised as an income over the period necessary to match it with
the costs, which is intended to compensate for on a systematic basis.
Grants and subsidies related to assets are generally deferred in the statement of financial position and
credited to the statement of comprehensive income over the useful life of the asset.
