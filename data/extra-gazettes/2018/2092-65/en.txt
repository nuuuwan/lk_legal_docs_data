Greetings !
Whereas, I, in the exercise of powers vested in me by Article 33 of  the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka, have appointed a Task Force by the Presidential Directive dated 05th June 2018 to direct, Coordinate and
monitor the development activities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
And,  whereas, it is recognized that in order to enhance the achievement of positive results expected from the
above Task Force, it is important to ensure representation of human resources from various fields,
And, whereas, it appears that the constitution of  the membership of the above Task Force needs to be further
broad- based,
