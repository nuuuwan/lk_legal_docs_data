PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE DEMOCRATIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC  OF  SRI  LANKA - 16.01.2018
AWARD
01. The Honourable Minister of Labour and Labour
Relations by virtue of the powers vested in him by Section
4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, Chapter 131 of the
Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 revised edition)
as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of
1968 (read with Industrial Disputes - Special Provisions)
Act, No. 37 of 1968 appointed me by his order dated
03.12.2010 and referred the dispute between the aforesaid
parties to me for settlement by Arbitration.
The matter in dispute between the aforesaid paties is :-
02. “Whether any injustice was caused to Mr. A.
Rajapaksha who was in service under the Mahaweli Authority
of Sri Lanka as the Assistant Director (Personnel
Administration) due to non backdating the said post to
11.09.2002 by the Authority and if an injustice was caused,
to what relief Mr. A. Rajapaksha is entitled”
Applicant was reprsented by Mr. P. L. S. Perera of
Samastha Lanka Eksath Sevaka Sangamaya and Mr. Tyugo
Anthony Attorney at Law, while respondent Organization was
represented by Mrs. Prasanga Aillpperuma, Attorney at Law.
To expedite resolution of the matter in dispute, applicant
was requested to submit a sworn affidavit, in order to cross
examination the applicant subsequently, After days of cross
examination, Applicant on 18th July, 2013 submitted in open
court, the following proposals -
(a) That he does will not wish to obtain the services of
the Samastha Lanka Eksath Sevak Sangamaya and
(b) That in lieu of the matter in dispute the backdating
of the post of Asst. Director (Personnel
Administration) w. e. f. 11.11.2002 substitute
appointing him a Resident Manager w. e. f.
11.09.2002 and pay up arrears of salaries applicable
thereto.
Lawyer for the respondent vehemently objected to the
proposed Amendments in that, the matter in issue had been
argued for 09 days and evidence of the witnesses are yet to
be heard, and if acceded to the request of the applicant. It
could be disastrous for the respondent.
Since the last day of hearing i. e. 18th July 2013, there
had been no submission from the applicant for the last four
years.
In the circumstances, I concede that the applicant had
lost interest in proceeding with the case. Besides, the
arbitrator is not mandated to modify or amend the matter in
dispute stipulated in the reference as well as the legal
personality who applied for relief, in this instance the
Samastha Lanka Eksath Sevaka Sangamaya. No relief as such
is granted.
This is just and a fair award.

Arbitrator.
