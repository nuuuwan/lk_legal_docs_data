The Applicant stated in his written submission, the
Respondent, Sri Lanka  Airline Limited has admitted that
the salary increment due on 1st June 2013 was paid to the
staff on 1st of December 2013 along with the arreas with
effective 1st June 2013.
The applicant retired on 23rd September 2013. The salary
increment was due on 1st June 2013 according to the rules.
By 1st June 2013 the Applicant had a vaild contract with the
Respondent, Sri Lankan Air Lines Limited. In the
circumstances the Applicant is entitled to salary increments
with effective from 1st June 2013.
The Respondent in his written submission stated that the
Applicant has no “locus standi” to maintain the reference.
The respondent further stated, the Applicant who was in
the managerial grade was not covered by a Collective
Agreement and had no right or entitlement to demand a
salary increment which is given at the sole discretion of the
management.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to the
following conclusions.
1. The Respondent Company has acted unfairly and
maliciously towards the applicant by denying him
the salary increment which was due to him as at 1st
June 2013 and the arreas up to 23rd September 2013
on which date he retired from the Respondent
Company.
2. The Respondent Company has acted malice towards
the Applicant denying him the salary inrements was
due to him as at 1st June 2013 and the arreas up to
23rd September 2013 whereas paying the other staff
salary increments due on 1st of June 2013, on 1st
of December 2013 along with the arreas with
effective from 1st of June 2013.
In the cirucumstances, I wish to quote majority decision
of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just
and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms

of the contract of employment. He can create new rights
and introduce new obligations between the parties. The
effect of the award is to introduce terms which become
implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out  that as
industrial arbitrator create a new contract for the future in
contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising
out an existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles
disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come
into force in the future when he cannot get the parties to
agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the
existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the
Respondent Company (party of the second part) has caused
injustice  to the applicant (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality
of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the
First part :
be paid a sum of Rupees One Hundred and Eighty Four
Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty Four (Rs. 184,664.00)
salary increment due on 1st of June 2013 along with the
arreas up to his retirement, on 23rd September 2013.
And the aforesaid money should be deposited by the Party
of the Second Part  at the office of the Labour Commissioner
of Negombo.
I further make order that this award should be
implemented within 21 days of the publication in the
Government Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award just and equitable.
