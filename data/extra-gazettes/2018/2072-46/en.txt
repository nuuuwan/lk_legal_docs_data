PART I : Sec. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 24.05.2018
AWARD
THE  Hon. Minister of  Labour and Labour Relations by virtue  of the powers vested in him under  Section 4 (1) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, Chapter 131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised Edition), as amended by Acts, Nos. 14 of
1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial Disputes - Special Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968, referred the Dispute
between the aforesaid parties to me for settlement by arbitration.
The matter in dispute is –
 ‘‘Whether any injustice has been caused to Mrs. W. P. Perera employed as Technical Engineer Grade II of the Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka, Through–
1. The placement in the post of Engineering Assistant Grade I not being backdated to 01.01.1986
2. The placement in the post of Technical Engineer Grade II not being backdated to 23.02.1999
3. Not being placed in Technical Engineer Grade I from 23.02.2002.
4. Not being placed in Technical Engineer Special Grade from 23.02.2005.
And if so what reliefs she is entitled to
The applicant Mrs. W. P. Perera was represented by Mr. M. N. A. Fernando while respondent Mahaweli Authority of
Sri Lanka was represented by Mrs. Prasanga Ailapperuma, Attorney at law.
To reduce the time involved it was decided to permit filing of a sworn affidavit by the applicant and the respondent to cross
examine thereafter in filing the initial submissions in terms of the regulations under the Industrial Disputes Act, as well as the
affidavit, the applicant stated that she was deprived of positioning in the different grades in the Technical service she was
employed. She submitted that she passed the examinations in 1986 but appointed only on 01.01.1990 whereas those who
passed at the same exam in 1986 were given the promotions effective 01.01.1986.
As a result of the delayed appontment she was short by 3 months for the next exam and could not therefore sit the Grade
II exam. She was called for the interview along with another 50 and 39 were listed as suitable for appointment and appoint-
ments were given according to merit and her rank in seniority on merit was 21. However 16 were appointed. Mr. D. D. M.
Dayananda who was placed on 17th position appealed but the  management rejected his appeal. Thereafter through
arbitration proceedings it came to light that there were 20 vacancies. She being in the 21st position in the merit list
management could have easily appointed her but failed to do so  in the meantime disregrading The merit list manegement
selected one Mr. Jayasekara who was on the 28th position over looking several others. She pointed out that management
violated the accepted procedure thus depriving her the due promotion resulting from economic losses continuously.
Applicant’s next witness Mr. D. D. M. Dayananda formerly Engineering
Assistant stated that
He joined Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka on 01.01.1986 as an Engineering Assistant and was promoted to Grade II in 1994.
He sat for the next promotion along with others and secured the 17th position on merit rating. Management selected 16 when
few more vacancies existed.  Therefore he took up the issue with the Department of Labour and the matter was referred to
arbitration.
The Hon. Arbitrator held with the plea since it highlighted that 20 more vacancies were available, apart from selections made
earlier. Also it came to light that persons in the merit list No. 19 and another on 28th position had been promoted by passing the
merit ranking.
Proceedings could not be continued with the witness as it was reported that he passed away.
Thereafter inquires were fixed on the following dates. Although respondent appeared on all dates applicant’s witness and
representatives failed to appear on most dates fixed and proceedings moved at a snails speed.
