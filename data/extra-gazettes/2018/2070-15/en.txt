3.1.1 International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
Refer 
Manual 
3.1.1
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) may be the appropriate method of procurement 
for large contracts. The purpose of ICB is to provide a level playing ﬁ eld for all prospective 
qualiﬁ ed bidders worldwide under the following circumstances in order that the PE will 
reap the ultimate beneﬁ t from enhanced market competition. Bidding opportunities must 
therefore be advertised worldwide to ensure maximum participation and value for money.
a) when the capacity of the domestic contractors, suppliers and service providers 
are limited and the advantage of ICB is evident; 
b) for Foreign Funded Projects, when the Foreign Funding Agency agreement 
requires the PE to resort to ICB procedures; 
However, in the case of Works contracts in view of the development of domestic construc-
tion industry, the possibility of slicing the contract and following “slice and package” to 
suit domestic contractors may be considered.
Local entities are also allowed to bid/proposals for procurements under ICB. 
Domestic preference criteria stipulated shall be used wherever applicable.
All other conditions including currencies, taxes and other statutory levies except domestic 
preference shall be applicable equally to foreign and domestic bidders.
3.1.2 National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
Refer 
Manual 
3.1.2
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) is the competitive bidding procedure that shall be 
generally applicable for most GOSL funded projects when the Goods, Works, Services

quoted in Sri Lanka Rupees.
NCB in foreign funded projects shall be used with the agreement of the Foreign Funding 
Agency as articulated in the respective ﬁ nancing agreement.

3.1.3 Limited International Competitive Bidding (LIB)
Refer 
Manual 
3.1.3
LIB is a procurement method which allows international procurements under a restricted 
and competitive environment.  
This method shall be used when there is only a limited number of suppliers/contractors 
or the amount of the contract is not large enough to attract suppliers or contractors 
through ICB, provided that the list of potential suppliers/contractors is sufﬁ cient to ensure 
competitiveness.
In the case of Limited International Competitive Bidding (LIB), all procedures followed 
under ICB shall apply except the requirement for advertising. 
3.1.4 Limited National Competitive Bidding (LNB)
Refer 
Manual 
3.1.4
This method shall be used when there is only a limited number of suppliers/contractors or 
the amount of the contract is not large enough to attract suppliers or contractors through 
NCB, provided that the list of potential suppliers/contractors is suf ﬁ cient to ensure 
competitiveness.
In the case of Limited National Competitive Bidding (LNB), all procedures followed under 
NCB shall apply except the requirement for advertising.
3.1.5 Shopping (International & National)
Refer 
Manual 
3.1.5

ii. Commodities for which speciﬁ cations are standard; or
iii. Small value Goods, Works, Services and Information Systems.
3.1.6 Direct Contracting
Refer 
Manual 
3.1.6
Direct contracting is contracting with a single source without competition and may be an 
appropriate method under special circumstances as stated below.
a)
 additional items are required under an existing contract (repeat order) which 
was awarded in accordance with competitive procedures considered under this 
Guideline. PEs shall be satisﬁ ed in such cases that no better offer is likely to be 
received and that the price to be paid is not more than the original price. Usu-
ally, the repeat order shall occur within 6 months of the original contract, with 
the additional quantities not exceeding ﬁ fty percentum (50%) of the original 
quantities.

b) standardization of equipment or spare parts compatible with existing equipment 
may justify additional purchases from the original supplier. For such purchases 
to be justiﬁ ed, the original equipment shall be suitable, the number of new items 
shall be less than the existing number and the price shall be reasonable.
c) the required equipment is proprietary and obtainable only from one source.
d) in exceptional cases, such as in response to natural disasters.
e) no Government Institution will qualify for automatic direct contract award.
3.1.7 Force Account
Force account is the execution of works by the use of the PE’s own personnel and equipment 
which may be the only practical method for executing certain kinds of Works. The use of 
force account may be justiﬁ ed where: 
a) quantities of work involved cannot be de ﬁ ned in advance; 
b) Works are small and scattered or in remote locations for which quali ﬁ ed con-
struction ﬁ rms are unlikely to bid at reasonable prices; 
c) Work is required to be carried out without disrupting ongoing operations; 
d) risks of unavoidable work interruption are better borne by the employer than by 
a contractor; or
e) there are emergencies needing immediate attention.
3.1.8 Emergency Procurement
Refer 
Manual
3.1.8
PE may use this method in exceptional circumstances, such as man-made or natural disasters 
or to meet unforeseen social obligations and such other similar situations which shall be 
determined by the Government authorities as being an emergency situation.
A formal covering approval for any emergency procurement shall be obtained from the 
appropriate PC at the ﬁ rst available opportunity.
3.1.9 Community participation in District / Divisional level Construction
Refer 
Manual
3.1.9
In the interest of project sustainability, or to achieve certain speci ﬁ c social objectives, 
such as creating employment opportunities in an identiﬁ ed area, it is desirable to call for 
the participation of local Community Based Organisations (CBOs) in the Procurement 
Process provided that such CBO is capable to undertaking such work in terms of ﬁ nancial, 
equipment and human resource requirements and has sufﬁ cient experience in the relevant 
ﬁ eld. Sub-contracting by the CBO shall not be allowed under any circumstances.

and that the price to be paid is not more than the original price. 
Usually, the repeat order shall occur within 6 months of the original contract, with the additional 
quantities not exceeding 50% of the original quantities.
 3.3 Types of Bidding
Refer 
Manual 
3.3
Types of bidding, with or without pre-qualiﬁ cation/initial selection

2. Single Stage Two Envelope 
3. Multistage Bidding 
3.3.1 Single Stage One Envelope Bidding
Refer 
Manual 
3.3.1

3.3.3  Multi - stage Bidding
Refer 
Manual 
3.3.3
It may be impractical to prepare complete technical speci ﬁ cations in advance for the 
procurement of:
a) large complex facilities for which a turnkey contract will be awarded for the 
design and build of a plant;
b) Works of a complex and special nature; or
c) complex information and communication technology that is subject to rapid 
technological advances.
In the ﬁ rst stage, proposals are invited on the basis of a conceptual design or performance 
or functional speciﬁ cations, subject to the PEs conducting proposal speciﬁ c documented 
understanding meetings with individual proponents to learn about and discuss possible 
solutions. 
In the second stage, the request for proposals document may be amended to re ﬂ ect the 
discoveries made in the proposal speciﬁ c documented understanding meeting, and issued 
to the qualiﬁ ed proponents, requesting them to submit ﬁ nal proposals. As requested in the 
request for proposals document, the second stage shall be submitted in two (2) envelopes 
for the technical and ﬁ nancial parts respectively where two envelopes are opened and 
evaluated sequentially.
3.4 Pre-qualiﬁ cation (PQ)/ Initial Selection (IS) of Bidders
Refer 
Manual 
3.4
The purpose of PQ/IS of bidders is to ensure invitations to bid are extended only to those who have 
adequate capabilities; with respect to construction or manufacturing facilities or supply of Goods, 
Services, or supply and installation of Information Systems; and their ﬁ nancial position, experience 
and past performance on similar contracts is satisfactory. 
In this context, PQ may be necessary for large complex Works or in circumstances which could 
discourage competition due to high cost of preparation of detailed bids/proposals such as; Custom-
designed equipment, industrial plants, specialized services, contracts to be let under design and 
build, management contracting, or complex Information Systems.

39A
7.7.2 Stage Two: Examination of Bids/Proposal for Substantial Responsiveness: 
a)  examination of substantial responsiveness to commercial requirements. 
b)  the bids/proposals that are responsive to commercial requirements will be examined for 
responsiveness to technical requirements.
 c) when examining the responsiveness to both commercial and technical requirements due 
recognition will be given for deviations. 
d) preparation of a table of responsiveness to commercial, technical requirements and deviations. 
7.7.3 Stage Three: Detailed Bid/Proposal Evaluation: 
At this stage detailed bid/proposal evaluation will be carried out in accordance with the Procurement 
Document, to determine the substantially responsive bids/proposals after which the ﬁ nancial 
evaluation should be carried out.
If the Procurement Documents provide provision for application of domestic preference, will be 
carried out.
At the end of this evaluation stage, a table of substantially responsive evaluated bids/proposals 
will be prepared.
7.7.4 Stage Four: Is to Determination of the Lowest Evaluated Substantially 
Responsive Bid/Proposal: 
Step one is examination of unbalanced bids/proposals in the civil works contracts; and
Step two is examination of post qualiﬁ cation criteria; and
Step Three is examination of alternative bids/proposals if there is provision in the Procurement 
Documents. 
Finally, Selection and recommendation of substantially responsive lowest evaluated bid/proposal.
Bid/proposal evaluation process ends up with preparation of bid evaluation 
report and recommendation for the award of contract.
7.7.5 Domestic Preference
Refer 
Manual 
7.7.5
With a view to providing a realistic value addition to local raw materials and domestic bidders, 
thereby promoting national industry and enterprise, when competing with foreign bidders, the 
domestic bidder’s bid shall be given the margins of preference as referred in the Manual during 
Bid Evaluation.

7.8 Clariﬁ cations from Bidders
During the evaluation of bids/proposals (particularly for complex works) there may be a need to 
seek clariﬁ cation from a bidder with the sole purpose of ensuring better understanding of the bid/
proposal as submitted so that the bid/proposal can be properly and fairly evaluated. These clariﬁ -
cations should not:
a) permit any substantive change to the bidder’s initial response; or
b) change the bid/proposal price, except correction of arithmetical errors in the pricing of 
the bid; or
c) give an advantage to the bidder from whom clari ﬁ cation is sought by providing that clar-
iﬁ cation;
On a request by PC or the BEC with the approval or delegated authority of PC, the PE will seek 
such clariﬁ cations from the bidder in writing.
In the case of BEC requesting PE to seek clariﬁ cations without the approval of PC, such requests 
shall be made known to the PC concurrently
7.9 Unrealistic Bids/Proposals
When the substantially responsive lowest evaluated bid/proposal appears to be unrealistic, on the 
request of BEC, PE may require the bidder to prove written clariﬁ cation, including detailed price 
analysis to demonstrate the consistency of prices with the scope of Works, proposed methodology 
and schedule. After evaluating the detailed price analysis, PC/BEC may as appropriate:
a) accept the bid/proposal; 
b) require that the total value of the performance security be increased, at the expense of the 
bidder; 
c) reject the bid/proposal.
7.10 Negotiations with the Substantially Responsive Lowest Evaluated 
Bidder
There should be no price negotiations except in the case of single bids/proposals as stated in (b) 
below. Selection of contractors by negotiations should be a rare exception rather than the rule. 
The negotiation should be held only with the substantially responsive lowest evaluated bidder. 
Negotiation shall be carried out by the PC with the assistance of BEC.
Negotiation may be resorted to only in the following circumstances, with the lowest evaluated 
responsive bidder; 
(a) having potential to improve outcome and bene ﬁ ts and reduce uncertainties; or

41A
(b) when only one bid/proposal is received after wide publicity has been given and prices 
quoted by the single bidder is high, the price also may be negotiated.
The PC shall keep a record of matters agreed with the bidder during negotiations and the PE shall 
execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the bidder relating to the agreed negotiated 
terms and conditions and this MOU should be included in the contract agreement. However, ne-
gotiations shall not substantially change the provisions prescribed in the Procurement Document.
7.11 Bid Evaluation Report (BER)
Refer 
Manual 
7.11
Immediately after the evaluation is completed the BEC should prepare a Bid Evaluation Report 
(BER) in the prescribed format and submit to the PC together with all supporting documents.
7.12 Rejection of All Bids/Proposals Received
Refer 
Manual
7.12
Rejection of all bids/proposals received can be justi ﬁ ed only under exceptional circumstances 
such as: 
a) lack of competition; 
b) bids/proposals are not substantially responsive;
c) when bid/proposal prices are substantially higher than the existing budget.
However, 
 (i) lack of competition shall not be determined solely on the number of bids/proposals 
received.
 (ii) even when only one bid/proposal is received, after wide publicity has been given, the 
bidding process may still be considered valid, if the prices quoted are reasonable. 
7.13 Re invitation of Bids/Proposals
a) Wider publicity must be given when re-inviting bids/proposals. 
b) In re-inviting bids/proposals, the same Procurement Documents shall not be used without 
rectifying possible deﬁ ciencies in the Procurement Document. 
c) Re-inviting bids/proposals must not be for the sole purpose of obtaining lower prices.

which its bid/proposal was not selected should address its request to the PE.
In the notiﬁ cation of contract award, the PE shall specify that any bidder who wishes to ascertain 
the grounds on which its bid/proposal was not selected, should request an explanation from the 
PE. The PE shall promptly provide the explanation as to why such bid/proposal was not selected,

CHAPTER 12 – FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT
12.1 Introduction 
The Framework Agreement is an arrangement to enable timely supply of Goods, Works, Services 
and Information Systems, which are commonly used by Procuring Entities to procure Goods, 
Works, Services and Information Systems which have national signiﬁ cance, in desired quality and 
at prices attributable to economies of scale resulting from bulk purchases ensuring value for money.
A Central Procurement Entity or Procuring Entity on its own  and on behalf of other Procuring 
Entities may administer Framework Procurements and enters into Framework Agreements with 
suppliers so that Procuring Entities may obtain value for money in their pur chasing while 
being assured that their procurement is compliant with the Prrocurement Guidelines. 
FWAs may be established for the anticipated procurement of Goods, Works, Services and Infor-
mation Systems, as and when required, over a speci ﬁ ed period of time. FWA does not commit 
either party to procure or supply. Once established, a FWA provides a fast and ef ﬁ cient way to 
procure Goods, Works or Services. 
A multi- supplier FWA allows a PE to select from a number of ﬁ rms, helping to ensure that each 
procurement represents best value for money.
FWAs may be appropriate for the procurement of Goods, Works, Services or Information Systems 
under the following circumstances: 
 frequent reordering is based on the same, or similar requirements, or set of speciﬁ cations; 
 where different departments and units under a Ministry or public agency or different 
Procuring Entities procure the same Goods, Works, Services or Information Systems, and 
aggregating the demand could lead to volume discounts;
 planning for emergency situations; or 
 no single ﬁ rm is considered to have sufﬁ cient capacity.
12.2 Features of Framework Agreement 
Refer 
Manual 
12.2
A Framework Agreement sets out the terms and conditions for subsequent Call-Off Contracts 
but places no obligations on the Procuring Entity to place future purchase orders, does not 
require or obligate Procuring Entity to issue any minimum number or value of purchase orders, 
and does not guarantee any minimum or maximum amount of expenditure.

CHAPTER 13 – e-GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT (e-GP)
13.1 Introduction
An e-GP is a process that uses the Internet and Internet tools to support every stage of the Pro-
curement Process.
The conversion from conventional (paper based) government procurement activities to e-GP is 
becoming an international trend in many countries in the World. GOSL is in the process of getting 
ready to implement e-GP in the country for Goods, Works, Services, Information Systems and 
Consultancy Services. However, there are major issues and challenges that need to be addressed 
before the implementation of fully pledged e-GP system. 
An e-Government Procurement (e-GP) is deﬁ ned as the collaborative use of information and com-

All stages of procurement cycle of the PEs can beneﬁ t from an e-GP such as procurement planning, 
pre-qualiﬁ cation, advertising, PPP advertisements, preparation and issuance of Procurement Docu-
ments, pre-bid conference, and issuing PB minutes, issuing addendums, modiﬁ cations and revising 
Procurement Documents,  clari ﬁ cations, modi ﬁ cation and addenda’s, receipt of bids/proposals, 
unsolicited proposals, bid/proposal closing, bid/proposal opening, evaluation of bids/proposals, 
request for clariﬁ cations, and contract award notiﬁ cation, and publication of contract award results.
13.3 Fully ﬂ edged e-GP system to be implemented by the PEs
Procurement Entities (PEs) may use an e-GP for all of their procurement activities provided the 
appropriate authority is satisﬁ ed with the adequacy and competence of the system, including;

CHAPTER 14 – OPEN CONTRACTING DATA STANDARD (OCDS)
14.1 Introduction
Refer 
Manual
14.1
The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) is a core product of the Open Contracting Partnership 
(OCP). The objective of the data standard is to support Governments to publish contracting data 
in a more accessible, inter-operable and useful manner and to enable the widest possible range of 
stakeholders to use contracting data effectively.
The Guidelines describes the OCDS presents a high-level approach for each implementation in 
an e-Procurement system. If the OCDS is implemented in an e-Procurement system when ﬁ rst 
introduced by incorporating OCDS within the system itself, the system speci ﬁ cation phase must 
explicitly deﬁ ne OCDS-speciﬁ c requirements (e.g. data ﬁ elds, triggers, reports, visualizer).
By adopting the OCDS into the contracting process, the expected bene ﬁ ts are important for key 
stakeholders. The users may use open contracting data in order to:
a) achieve value for money;
b) provide the potential to increase trust and transparency with the public, for the Government;
c) strengthen the transparency, accountability and integrity of public contracting;
d) access and review details of public contracting processes and monitor spending to ensure 
that citizens are getting the best outcomes, for the non-governmental organizations;

e) enable the private sector to compete for public contracts;
f) monitor service delivery (from both aid and budget-executed projects) for effectiveness;
g) get involved in decision making, for the general public;
h) reduce opportunities for fraudulent or corrupt use of public resources. 
The publication of data could be organized in the following manner;
 i. proactive publication requirement;
 ii. timing and frequency of publication;
 iii. formats and licences of publication;
 iv. procurements and contracts;
 v. stakeholder engagement.
14.2 Standard
Refer 
Manual
14.2
The OCDS is used to describe unique contracting processes. The ﬁ rst step towards publishing open 
contracting data is to identify the contracting processes in the system data. A contracting process 
ties together information about the different stages related to the lifespan of a contract, beginning 
with planning and progressing through initiation and implementation stages accordingly, as well 
as ending when a contract is either completed or closed.
CHAPTER 15 – GREEN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT
15.1 Introduction to Green Public Procurement Refer 
Manual
15.1
It is a mandatory that all Government Institutions take into account environmental considerations 
when procuring Goods, Works, Services and Information Systems.
Green Public Procurement (GPP) is a Public Procurement, which integrates environmental 
considerations in the whole Public Procurement Process including planning and procurement and 
takes into the consideration the entire life cycle of the Goods, Works or Service. In addition, it is 
considered to be appropriate and one of the most effective tools seeking to reduce negative impacts 
on the environment.

Refer 
Manual
15.1.1
Sri Lanka Government has taken a policy decision to adopt green procurement practice 
as a mandatory requirement and to include basic premises in the new Procurement 
Guidelines.
Green Procurement means procuring Goods, Works and Services that cause minimal 
adverse environmental impacts. The procurement procedure itself includes human health 
and environmental concerns and those safeguard measures which are to be included in 
the tender documents. Speciﬁ cally, Government Institutions are encouraged to avoid 
single use disposable items and purchase products, Works and Services and efforts to 
be given to the following points;
a) with improved re-cyclability, high re-cyclable contents, reduce packing and 
greater durability and wherever possible using green material;
b) with greater energy ef ﬁ ciency;
c) utilizing clean technology and or clean fuel;
d) which result in reduced water consumption, and increase water harvesting;
e) which emit fewer irritating or toxic substances during installation or use;
f) which result in smaller production of toxic substances or of less toxic substance 
upon disposal and sustainable garbage disposal;
g) apply wherever possible; the polluter pays principle and the producer re-
sponsibility.

exchange   of experiences, information and knowledge on the arrangements for GPP and 
SPP;
c) elaborate and advise on, criteria and indicators to be used in Public Procurement in view 
of promoting GPP and SPP;
d) foster Public Procurement planning, in order to timely integrate GPP and SPP criteria in 
to the Procurement Process;
e) ﬁ rst starting strategy of GPP is to begin with commonly used Goods, Works and Services 
and to expand the Green Procurement list;

15.5 Introducing Green Speciﬁ cations for Commonly Used Items
Refer 
Manual
15.5
IAEC may develop green speci ﬁ cations for commonly used products, Goods and Works using 
existing certiﬁ ed material by local green certiﬁ cation organizations.  Each PE shall obtain approval 
for their green speciﬁ cations from IAEC.
15.6 Inclusion of Green Public Procurement criteria in Procurement 
Documents 
Refer 
Manual
15.6
For the purchase of common use items, each PE may adopt green speci ﬁ cations as “mandatory” 
features in the bid/proposal speci ﬁ cations when the products are available on the market with 
adequate models and quantities in supply. In this connection, “mandatory” green requirements are 
speciﬁ ed in the Manual.
For new green speciﬁ cations developed with uncertain market availability, green speciﬁ cations will 
be included in the bid/proposal speciﬁ cations as “desirable” features.
15.7 Evaluation of Bids/Proposals with Green Criteria 
Refer 
Manual
15.7
The Bid Evaluation Committee (BEC) will evaluate bids/proposals which can meet the mandatory 
features and recommend either the lowest conforming offer (for a bid/proposal without a marking 
scheme) or the highest scoring conforming offer (for a bid/proposal with a marking scheme) for 
acceptance. As regards the green desirable features, they are not taken into account in the bid/
proposal evaluation except where there are two or lowest conforming offers which are identical 
in all respects, the one which could meet the desirable green speci ﬁ cation(s) could be given the 
preference. These arrangements should be clearly spelt out in the Procurement Document. 
 In order to encourage potential suppliers to offer products that can comply with green speci ﬁ ca-
tions, consideration may also be given to adopting a marking scheme with appropriate weighting 
for green speciﬁ cations against the price offered. For this purpose, prior approval has to be obtained 
from the Procurement Committee (PC). In drawing up the marking scheme, due weight should be 
given to whether it will achieve the value for money objective.
BEC will keep record of the bids/proposals that can meet the “desirable” green speciﬁ cations and 
review the market availability of products meeting individual green speci ﬁ cations on a regular 
basis based on the bid/proposal responses and market information, with a view to changing them 
into “mandatory” or “desirable requirements attracting marks” in future bidding exercises when 
circumstances warrant. Individual “desirable” green speci ﬁ cations without suf ﬁ cient models or 
quantities in supply will continue to be included as “desirable” features.

15.8 Annual Report on Green Product Purchase
Refer 
Manual
15.8
To monitor the green product purchasing situation, the NPC will invite the Procuring Entities to 
submit a report on its last calendar year’s purchases within the ﬁ rst two months of each calendar 
year. Procuring Entities are advised to go through the green product list and check whether the 
products to be purchased are included on the list. If products to be purchased are listed, the Procuring 
Entity should try to apply the recommended green speciﬁ cations by making reference to the practice 
mentioned in paragraphs 15.6 and 15.7 above and include the item code and green speci ﬁ cation 
code as recommended by the IAEC in the common use item list. In parallel, the Procuring Entities 
should consolidate the information of the product ID, purchase values and the information on 
whether green speciﬁ cations are adopted or not and  whether the ﬁ nal purchases meet such green 
speciﬁ cations for incorporation into the annual report to NPC.
15.9 Cost Implication 
Procuring Entities should absorb any additional cost incurred in procuring Goods, Works and Ser-
vices with green speciﬁ cations. While costs of these products and services may in some cases be 
higher than those without green features, it is expected that the Government’s initiative of taking 
the lead on Green Procurement would facilitate the development of the relevant market and the 
prices of products meeting green speciﬁ cations would be lowered over time.

The NPC requires that Consultants provide professional, objective, and impartial 
advice and at all times hold the PE’s interest’s paramount, without any consider-
ation for future work, and that in providing advice they avoid con ﬂ icts with other 
assignments and their own corporate interests. Consultants shall not be hired for 
any assignment that would be in con ﬂ ict with their prior or current obligations to 
other clients, or that may place them in a position of being unable to carry out the 
assignment in the best interests of the PE. Without limitation on the generality of the 
foregoing, Consultants shall not be hired under the circumstances set forth below:
a) Con ﬂ ict between consulting activities and procurement of Goods, Works, 
or Non- Consulting Services: a ﬁ rm that has been engaged by the PE to 
provide Goods, Works, or Non-Consulting Services for a project; or, where 
those Consulting Services were provided by any af ﬁ liate (that directly or 
indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that 
ﬁ rm) or associate, shall be disqualiﬁ ed from providing Consulting Services 
resulting from or directly related to those Goods, Works, or Non-Consulting 
Services;
b) A ﬁ rm for the preparation or implementation of a project, or any af ﬁ liate 
(that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common 
control with that Consulting ﬁ rm), shall be disqualiﬁ ed from subsequently 
providing Goods, Works, or Non-Consulting Services resulting from or 
directly related to the Consulting Services for such preparation or imple-
mentation;
c) Con ﬂ ict among consulting assignments: neither a Consultant (including its 
personnel and sub-consultants), nor any afﬁ liate (that directly or indirectly 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that Consultant), 
shall be hired for any assignment that, by its nature, creates a con ﬂ ict of 
interest with another assignment of the Consultants’; and
d) Relationship with PE’s staff: consulting ﬁ rms (including their experts 
and other personnel, and sub-consultants) that have a close business or 
family relationship with a professional staff of the PE or any other party 
representing or acting on behalf of the PE, who are directly or indirectly 
involved in any part of: (i) the preparation of the TOR for the assignment, 
(ii) the selection process for the contract, or (iii) the supervision of such 
contract, may not be awarded a contract, unless the con ﬂ ict stemming 
from this relationship has been resolved in a manner acceptable to the PE 
throughout the selection process and the execution of the contract.

1.4.4 Unfair Competitive Advantage
Fairness and transparency in the Consultant selection process require that ﬁ rms or 
their afﬁ liates or Individual Consultants competing for a consulting assignment do 
not derive a competitive advantage from having provided Consulting Services relat-
ed to it. To that end, the PE shall make available to all the short-listed Consultants, 
together with the request for proposals, all information that would in that respect 
give a Consultant a competitive advantage.
Officials shall refrain from compromising the Code of Ethics by accepting 
inappropriate gifts and hospitality at any stage of Procurement Process. Consultants 
shall be disquali ﬁ ed from the selection process if found offering any gift or 
inducement which may have an effect of in ﬂ uencing a decision or impairing the 
objectivity of an ofﬁ cial.

The laws applicable to Procurement Actions shall be the Laws of the Democratic Socialist 
Republic of Sri Lanka.

CHAPTER 3 – SELECTION PROCESS AND SELECTION METHODS OF 
CONSULTANCY FIRMS AND INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANTS
The selection method shall achieve the objectives of VfM, fairness, clarity, ﬁ t-for-purpose, transparency and conﬁ dentiality. 
Hence the appropriate method of selection is related to the nature, size, complexity, likely impact of the assignment, and the 
technical and ﬁ nancial considerations.
A consultancy ﬁ rm shall be selected in obtaining the services required rather than getting the service done by one or more 
individuals for assignments for which: 
a. coordinated input of team of personnel with different expertise are required; and
b. coordination, administration or collective responsibility is important.
In other cases, PE may select Individual Consultant/s (IC). The selection method of Individual Consultant is outlined in 
section 3.2 below.
3.1 Methods for the Selection of Consultancy Firm
Refer 
Manual 
3.1
The choice of the appropriate method of selection is related to the factors mentioned above. It 
is therefore necessary to carefully de ﬁ ne the assignment, particularly the Terms of reference 
including objective and the scope of the services, before deciding on the selection method.
The following selection methods shall be determined as appropriate by the PE prior to issuance 
of the request for proposals from prospective Consultants.
a) Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS);
b) Quality Based Selection (QBS);
c) Fixed Budget Selection (FBS);
d) Least Cost Selection (LCS);
e) Consultant’s Qualiﬁ cations based Selection(CQS);
f) Direct Selection-Single Source Selection (SSS); and
g) Selection of particular types of Consultants

18A
3.1.1 Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.1
QCBS is a competitive process among Shortlisted consulting ﬁ rms under which the 
selection of the successful ﬁ rm takes into account the quality of the Proposal and the 
cost of the services. The request for proposals document shall specify the minimum 
score for the technical Proposals. The relative weight to be given to the quality and cost 
depends on the nature of the assignment. Weightage for quality part of the proposal is 
always higher than the ﬁ nancial part. Among the Proposals that are responsive to the 
requirements of the request for proposals document and are technically quali ﬁ ed, the 
Proposal with the highest combined (quality and cost) score is considered the Most 
Advantageous Proposal.
Preferred method of selection of Consultancy ﬁ rm shall be QCBS. Other methods shall 
be used only under the circumstances described against such selection methods. 
The QCBS method is appropriate when: 
a) the scope of work can be precisely deﬁ ned;
b)  the TOR are well speciﬁ ed and clear; and,
c) PE and the Consultants can estimate with reasonable accuracy the personnel 
time as well as the other inputs required of the Consultants.
3.1.2 Quality Based Selection (QBS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.2
QBS is a method based on evaluating only the quality of the technical proposals and the 
subsequent negotiation of the ﬁ nancial proposal and the contract award to the Consul-
tancy ﬁ rm who submitted the highest ranked technical proposal.
When QBS is used, the proposal quality is evaluated without using cost as an evaluation 
criterion. The RFP will request ﬁ rms to submit both technical and ﬁ nancial proposals 
at the same time, but in separate envelops (single stage – two envelope system). The 
ﬁ nancial proposal of only the highest technically quali ﬁ ed ﬁ rm is open and evaluated. 
The Procuring Entity and the related ﬁ rm shall discuss the work plan, the TOR, and 
ﬁ nancial proposal, etc. of the contract. After successful completion of technical and 
ﬁ nancial negotiations with the highest ranked ﬁ rm, the contract will be awarded. The 
rest of ﬁ nancial proposals will be returned unopened to the unsuccessful ﬁ rms. QBS is 
appropriate for the following types of assignments:
a) complex or highly specialized assignments for which it is dif ﬁ cult to de ﬁ ne 
precise TOR and the input required from the ﬁ rm, and for which the Procuring 
Entity expects the ﬁ rm to demonstrate innovation in its Proposals;
b) assignments that have a high downstream impact; and
c) assignments that can be carried out in substantially different ways, so that 
Proposals will not be comparable.

19A
3.1.3 Fixed Budget- based Selection (FBS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.3
Like QCBS, FBS is a competitive process among Shortlisted consulting ﬁ rms under 
which the selection of the successful ﬁ rm takes into account the quality of the Proposal 
and the cost of the services. In the request for proposals document, the cost of services 
is speciﬁ ed as a ﬁ xed budget that shall not be exceeded.
FBS is appropriate when:
a) the type of Consulting Service required is simple and TOR can be precisely 
deﬁ ned;
b) the time and personnel inputs can be accurately assessed to ensure the budget 
is reasonably estimated and set;
c) the budget is suf ﬁ cient for the ﬁ rm to perform the assignment. 
d) the budget is ﬁ xed and cannot be exceeded.
Evaluation of all technical proposals shall be carried out ﬁ rst. The Firms securing less 
than the minimum marks shall be rejected, and the ﬁ nancial proposals of the rest shall 
be opened in public.
Proposals of which evaluated ﬁ nancial proposal exceed the indicated ﬁ xed budget shall 
be rejected. 
The technical Proposal with the highest technical score that meets the ﬁ xed budget 
requirement, be selected and invited to ﬁ nalize the contract. 
3.1.4 Least Cost Selection (LCS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.4
Similar to QCBS, LCS is a competitive process among Shortlisted consulting ﬁ rms under 
which the selection of the successful ﬁ rm takes into account the quality of the Proposal 
and the cost of the services. 
Least–cost selection (LCS) is generally appropriate for selecting Consultants for smaller 
value assignments, of a standard or routine nature where well–established practices and 
standards exist. 
The RFP shall deﬁ ne the “minimum” qualifying mark for the “quality” and request the 
ﬁ rms to submit at the same time technical and ﬁ nancial proposals in separate envelopes. 
Technical proposals will be opened ﬁ rst and evaluated. Those securing less than the 
minimum qualifying mark speci ﬁ ed in the RFP will be rejected, and the ﬁ nancial 
proposals of the rest will be opened in public. The ﬁ rm with the lowest evaluated cost 
shall then be selected and invited to ﬁ nalize the contract.

3.1.5 Consultant’s Qualiﬁ cation-based Selection (CQS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.5
CQS is appropriate for;
a) smaller value assignments; or
b) an emergency situation; and
c) preparation and evaluation of full- ﬂ edged competitive Proposals is not justiﬁ ed.
CQS is appropriate for higher value assignments only when:
d) satis ﬁ es the condition given under ‘c’ above; and
e) highly specialized expertise is required for the assignment: and
f) few Consultants are quali ﬁ ed.
The PE shall request expressions of interest (REOI), by attaching the TOR to the REOI. 
Only a selected Consultancy ﬁ rms shall be requested to provide information about their 
relevant experience and qualiﬁ cations. Out of the long list received in response to the 
REOI, a shortlist of minimum of three ﬁ rms shall be prepared and the PE will select 
the ﬁ rm with the best quali ﬁ cations and relevant experience and invite it to submit its 
combined technical and ﬁ nancial Proposals for negotiations.
Should the negotiations failed the PE shall obtain a combined proposal from the next 
ranked ﬁ rm until an agreement is reached.
Advertisement of REOI is not mandatory.
3.1.6 Direct Selection - Single Source Selection (SSS)
Refer 
Manual
3.1.6
Generally, Single Source Selection of consultancy ﬁ rms does not provide the bene ﬁ ts 
of competition in regard to quality and cost, lacks transparency in selection, and could 
encourage unacceptable practices. Therefore, single source selection shall only be used 
in exceptional cases.
While going through this method of selection, the PE will provide well described and 
evidence based justi ﬁ cations to ensure economies of scales, ef ﬁ ciency and value for 
money. The justi ﬁ cations shall be examined at an appropriate level for making the 
decision.
SSS will be used only in exceptional cases, where it provides clear advantage over 
competition in the following cases;
SSS may be appropriate under the following circumstances:
a) an existing contract for Consulting Services, may be extended for additional 
Consulting Services of a similar nature, if it is properly justiﬁ ed; no advantage 
may be obtained by competition; and the prices are reasonable. Extended ser-
vices shall not be more than 25% of the existing contract; or

21A
b) for Consulting Services which are natural continuation of previous assignment 
carried out by the same ﬁ rm within the last 12 months, where it was selected 
on competitive basis for the ﬁ rst assignment and where continuity of technical 
services is unavoidable and if performance has been satisfactory in the previous 
assignment(s). Extended continuation services shall not be more than 50% of 
the previous assignment;
c) in cases of an emergency situation where a rapid selection is essential;
d) for smaller value assignments;
e) when only one ﬁ rm is qualiﬁ ed, or has experience of exceptional worth for the 
assignment;
f) speci ﬁ c recommendation shall be obtained from the relevant CSC;
g) to obtain necessary prior approval for the SSS justiﬁ cation with all other relevant 
details in Writing from the CAO, concerned on recommendation by a CSC;
h) for Foreign Funded Projects this selection method shall be used only with the 
prior approval of the relevant funding agency;
In all instances of direct selection, the Procuring Entity shall ensure fairness and equity, 
and shall have in place procedures to ensure that:
 i. the prices are reasonable and consistent with the market rates for services of a 
similar nature; and
 ii. the required Consulting Services are not split into smaller- size procurements 
to avoid competitive processes.
3.1.7 Selection of Particular Type of Consultants
Refer 
Manual
3.1.7
Under special circumstances as described below Consultants may be selected.
3.1.7.1 Consultancy Works by State Universities and State Research & 
Development (R&D) Centers
With the objective of promoting active institute/industry links/partnerships, research 
based consultancy assignments directed towards improvements of ef ﬁ ciency and 
productivity of the local industries and helping to realize the country’s socio-economic, 
environmental, human development policies, may be directly assigned to state universities 
and state R&D centers. In such situations, PE shall follow the process using direct 
selection method. The fees billed for permanent staff by the university or R&D center 
in no case should exceed twice the basic salary of such staff. When such Consulting 
Services are given, the university or R&D center shall follow the requirements given 
in the Consultant’s Manual. PE shall ensure that the relevant permanent staff of the 
university or R&D center is under the control and direction of the university authorities, 
have necessary legal and administrative clearances to engage in consultancy assignments, 
and ensure that the assignments given under this section are not subcontracted, assigned 
or otherwise transferred to any person or entity outside the university.

provide background information (including a list of existing relevant studies and 
basic data), and provides details on the required quali ﬁ cations of the key experts; 
and lists the expected deliverables to facilitate the Consultants’ preparation of their 
proposals. If transfer of knowledge or training is an objective, it should be speciﬁ cally 
outlined along with details of number of staff to be trained, and so forth, to enable 
Consultants to estimate the required resources. 
However, TOR should not be too detailed and in ﬂ exible, so that competing 
Consultants may propose their own methodology and stafﬁ ng. Consultancy Firms 
shall be encouraged to comment on the TOR in their proposals. The PE’s and 
Consultants’ respective responsibilities should be clearly deﬁ ned in the TOR.
b) TOR should provide a level playing ﬁ eld for all prospective Consultants. It should 
meet the essential requirements of the PE.
c) It should normally be based on respective national standards or equivalent 
international standards where applicable.

CHAPTER 7–EV ALUATION OF PROPOSALS
7.1 General Refer 
Manual 7.1
All the proposals should be evaluated strictly on the basis of evaluation criteria, and terms and 
conditions incorporated in the RFP document. No new conditions and criteria should be brought 
in while evaluating the proposals. Aim should be to ensure that no ﬁ rm gets undue advantage over 
others.
7.2 Conﬁ dentiality
After closing of submission of Proposals, information relating to substance, clari ﬁ cation and 
evaluation of Proposals and recommendations concerning selection shall not be communicated to 
Firms nor to any other person, (unless they are formally involved in the process.), until after the 
date on which the formal announcement is due.
7.3 Services of Outside Expert/s for Evaluation of Proposals
(a) If the evaluation of Proposals is entrusted to outside expert/s, it shall be made under the 
supervision and guidance of CSC;
(b) Outside experts shall not form part of CSC;
(c) The CSC shall prepare its formal report along with the outside expert’s report.
7.4 Time Frame for Proposal Evaluation
Refer 
Manual
7.4 and 7.5
Proposal evaluation shall be undertaken expeditiously, leaving ample time to seek all the requisite 
formal approvals. Hence, proposals shall be evaluated within the period speciﬁ ed in the PTS.
7.5 Extension of Proposal Validity
Refer 
Manual
7.4 and 7.5
CSC must endeavor to make the award in keeping with the PTS and within the bid validity period.
(a) In exceptional situations where it is not possible to make the award before the expiry of proposal 
validity period, prior to such expiration, the validity period may be extended;
(b) If a bidder does not agree to extend the validity of the proposal, such proposal shall be excluded 
from further consideration.
(c) Any extension of validity so requested, may result the ﬁ rm substituting the original staff 
proposed during the negotiations. However, it shall be in accordance with terms and conditions 
laid down in the RFP.

7.6 Original Proposal to be Evaluated
Only the Proposals marked “original” shall be evaluated by the CSC. 
In case of e-GP system, there will be only one digital copy in the e-GP System submitted in 
accordance with the forms and formats as provisioned in the system.
7.7 Purpose and Stages of Proposal Evaluation
a) The evaluation of the Proposals shall be carried out in two stages; ﬁ rst the quality and 
then the cost. The evaluation shall be carried out in full conformity with the provisions of 
the RFP. The purpose of Proposal evaluation will vary with the selection method used.
b) Precise evaluation procedures vary between the different methodologies, but all consist 
of three stages:
 i. a preliminary screening  to eliminate proposals which do not comply with the basic 
requirements of the RFP and the ﬁ rm does not meet mandatory eligibility requirements;
 ii. a detailed technical evaluation  to determine whether proposals are responsive to 
the RFP document, to assess the relative quality of the proposals, using a merit point 
scoring system speciﬁ ed in the RFP and to determine which proposals should proceed 
to the ﬁ nancial opening and evaluation; and
 iii. a ﬁ nancial evaluation to examine the prices of the proposal/s and determine which 
is the successful proposal that should be recommended for award of contract.
7.8 Evaluation of Technical Proposal
7.8.1 CSC to agree on the Rating System in Advance
All members of the CSC should familiarize themselves with the RFP (in particular 
the TOR), the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria speci ﬁ ed in the data sheet, and the 
selection procedure. The CSC should meet before the deadline for submission of the 
proposals to conﬁ rm that there is a common understanding of the evaluation method, 
the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria, and a joint deﬁ nition of the rating system. It is 
important not to wait until after the technical proposals are opened to deﬁ ne the rating 
system, since these de ﬁ nitions could be biased by the knowledge of the contents of 
the proposals.

41A
7.8.2 Evaluation to be Carried out by CSC
Evaluation shall be carried out by each CSC member other than the chairperson, 
individually. The CSC ﬁ rst reviews each proposal to con ﬁ rm that it is substantially 
responsive, that is, that there are no important/material omissions or deviations from 
the stated objectives, TOR, or other key requirements of the RFP. Individual’s results 
shall be recorded on pre-formulate worksheets or web-forms templates. By applying 
the criteria and sub-criteria speciﬁ ed in the RFP, CSC shall establish the absolute, not 
the relative, quality of the proposals.
After each member has independently completed the evaluation, the CSC should meet 
to review, and if necessary discuss the merits of, individual evaluations and scores. 
Some evaluators tend to be generous while others will be rigid in their judgment and 
ratings. Such disparity does not matter, provided each evaluator is consistent and dif-
ferences in scores are not too large. The chairperson of the CSC shall review the large 
differences and discuss with the members at a joint meeting, since they often are caused 
by improper or inaccurate use of the rating system. As a result of these discussions, a 
member may revise some of his or her ratings and scores if necessary; these changes 
should be recorded. For each proposal, the CSC should then calculate the average of 
the scores allocated by all members under each criterion, establish the technical ranking 
of the proposals, and identify the best. The evaluation report must include the joint as 
well as the individual evaluations.
7.8.3 Strengths and Weaknesses of Each Proposal to be Recorded
During the evaluation the committee also should comment on the strengths and 
weaknesses of all proposals that have passed the minimum technical qualifying mark 
indicated in the RFP. This will help identify any issues in the recommended proposal 
that need to be clariﬁ ed during negotiations.
7.8.4 Evaluation Based on Disclosed Criteria
Refer 
Manual 
7.8.4
The evaluation shall be based on the evaluation criteria deﬁ ned in the RFP. The CSC 
shall evaluate each technical proposal, taking into account several criteria including:
i. the Consultant’s relevant experience for the assignment;
ii. the quality of the methodology proposed;
iii. the qualiﬁ cations and experience of the key staff proposed;
iv. Other matters, such as the extent of participation of nationals among 
key staff in situations where the shortlist comprises of national and 
international ﬁ rms and transfer of knowledge for assignments where 
training is needed.

7.9 Technical Proposal Evaluation Form
Immediately after the evaluation of technical proposal is completed a Technical Evaluation Report 
shall be prepared by CSC in the format as published by NPC recording and explaining the scores 
given to each proposal. For each proposal, the report also should indicate technical weaknesses 
or deviations from the terms set out in the RFP and comment on their acceptability or alternative 
proposed by the Consultants, and comment on their acceptability. The technical evaluation report 
is a conﬁ dential document and its contents shall not be disclosed, except to the extent as required 
under the provisions of the Right to Information Act. 
7.10 Clariﬁ cations from Consultants During Evaluation
During the evaluation, CSC may request clariﬁ cation or additional information from the Consul-
tants through the PE. However, CSC may not seek clari ﬁ cations or additional information from 
the Consultants that could change the substance of the proposal.
7.11 Opening of Financial Proposals
After preparing the technical evaluation report, the PE shall notify the Consultants whose proposals 
did not meet the minimum technical score speciﬁ ed in the RFP or were found to be nonresponsive, 
indicating that the Consultants’ ﬁ nancial proposals will be returned unopened at the end of the 
selection process. The PE simultaneously noti ﬁ es Consultants whose technical proposals were 
above the minimum technical score and informs them of the date, time, and place set for opening 
the ﬁ nancial envelopes. The opening date should be deﬁ ned to allow sufﬁ cient time for Consultants 
to make arrangements to attend the opening.
The proposal opening committee (POC) veriﬁ es that the ﬁ nancial proposals have remained sealed 
and then opens them. The ﬁ nancial proposals of technically qualiﬁ ed ﬁ rms will be opened publicly 
in the presence of ﬁ rms or their representatives who choose to attend. The name of the Consultant, 
the technical points, and the proposed prices shall be read aloud and recorded as each ﬁ nancial 
proposal is opened.
When e-GP submission of proposals is used, this information shall be posted online. No modiﬁ ca-
tion to ﬁ nancial proposals is permitted. The PE prepares the minutes of the public opening, which 
should be attached to the Financial Evaluation Report.
If Consultants were initially requested to submit ﬁ nancial proposals under QBS, the PE shall notify 
the Consultant with the highest-ranked technical proposal and indicates the date, time, and place 
set for negotiating the ﬁ nancial proposal and the contract.

7.12 Evaluation of Financial Proposals
Refer 
Manual
7.12
The CSC should ﬁ rst establish that the ﬁ nancial proposals are completed (i.e. whether they have 
priced all the items of the corresponding technical proposal. If not the CSC shall cost them and 
add those costs to the initial price if Time Based type contract is used).
Then the Proposals are checked for arithmetical errors. Arithmetical errors should be corrected, 
and the corresponding adjustments made to the offered prices to obtain the ﬁ nal evaluated prices. 
In case of e-GP system, a separate checking of arithmetic errors need not be effected if the price 
of each item is automatically calculated by the system using the rates given by the Consultants 
against the requirements provided by PE.
Activities and items described in the technical proposals, but not priced, shall be assumed to be 
included in the prices of other activities or items.
If an activity or line item is quanti ﬁ ed differently in the ﬁ nancial proposal than in the technical 
proposal and the Time-Based Form of Contract has been included in the RFP, the CSC shall correct 
the quantiﬁ cation indicated in the ﬁ nancial proposal so as to make it consistent with what is indicat-
ed in the technical proposal, apply the relevant unit price included in the ﬁ nancial proposal to the 
corrected quantity, and correct the total proposal cost. In case of e-GP system, the system should 
be geared for automatic calculation.
If the Lump-Sum Form of Contract has been included in the RFP, no corrections are applied to the 
ﬁ nancial proposal in this respect.
For the purpose of comparing proposals, evaluated prices shall be converted to a single currency 
using the exchange rate, date and source indicated in the RFP where appropriate.
When FBS is adopted, adjustments made by the CSC to correct omissions or in- consistencies de-
tected during the evaluation of the ﬁ nancial proposal could raise the evaluated price of a proposal 
over the available budget indicated in the RFP. This could lead to the rejection of the proposal.
7.13 Negotiation with the Highest Ranked Consultant
Refer 
Manual
7.13
The objective of negotiations is to arrive at a mutually satisfactory contract between the PE and 
the selected Consultants. The parties will discuss the technical proposal submitted, agree on the 
detailed scope of work of the Consultant assignment and all related arrangements, negotiate ﬁ nancial 
terms, and discuss and ﬁ nalize contract conditions. A good contract should protect the interests of 
both parties in a balanced way.

44A
7.13.1 Negotiation in case of QCBS, FBS and LCS
After completion of the evaluation, the CSC shall negotiate a contract with the ﬁ rst 
ranked Consultancy ﬁ rm. Negotiations shall include discussions of the TOR, the meth-
odology, work plan, deliverables, staff schedule, PE’s counterpart facilities, and special 
conditions of the contract. These discussions shall not substantially alter the original 
TOR attached to the invitation. The ﬁ nal TOR and the agreed methodology shall be 
incorporated in “Description of Services” (DOS), which shall form part of the contract.
The selected Consultancy ﬁ rm should not be allowed to substitute key staff, unless 
both parties agree that undue delay in the selection process makes such substitution 
unavoidable or that such changes are critical to meet the objectives of the assignment. 
If this is not the case and if it is established that key staff were offered in the Proposal 
without consulting their availability, (as far as possible to avoid such situations Con-
sultants can have an written agreement with the key staff on their availability for the 
particular assignment before submitting their names) the Consultancy ﬁ rm may be 
disqualiﬁ ed and the process continued with the next ranked Consultancy ﬁ rm. The 
key staff proposed for substitution shall have qualiﬁ cations equal to or better than the 
key staff initially proposed.
During the negotiations on ﬁ nancial proposal, unit rates for staff- months and reim-
bursable shall not be negotiated, since these have already been a factor of selection in 
the cost of the proposal, unless there are exceptional reasons.
If the negotiations fail to result in an acceptable contract, the CSC shall terminate 
the negotiations and invite the next ranked Consultancy ﬁ rm for negotiations. The 
Consultant shall be informed of the reasons for termination of the negotiations. Once 
negotiations are commenced with the next ranked Consultancy ﬁ rm, the CSC shall not 
reopen the earlier negotiations. After negotiations are successfully completed with the 
next ﬁ rm, the CSC shall make their ﬁ nal determination of the contract award. After 
this determination, the PE shall promptly notify other Consultancy ﬁ rms on the short 
list that they were unsuccessful.

7.13.2 Negotiation in Case of QBS, CQS and SSS
After completion of the evaluation the CSC shall negotiate a contract with the ﬁ rst 
ranked Consultant. Negotiations shall include discussions of the TOR, the methodology, 
work plan, deliverables, staff schedule, PE’s counterpart facilities, and special 
conditions of the contract. These discussions shall not substantially alter the original 
TOR attached to the invitation. The ﬁ nal TOR and the agreed methodology shall be 
incorporated in “Description of Services,” which shall form part of the contract.
The selected Consultant should not be allowed to substitute key staff, unless both parties 
agree that undue delay in the selection process makes such substitution unavoidable 
or that such changes are critical to meet the objectives of the assignment. If this is 
not the case and if it is established that key staff were offered in the Proposal without 
consulting their availability (as far as possible to avoid such situations Consultants can 
have an agreement with the key staff on their availability for the particular assignment 
before submitting their names), the Consultant may be disquali ﬁ ed, and the process 
continued with the next ranked Consultant. The key staff proposed for substitution 
shall have qualiﬁ cations equal to or better than the key staff initially proposed.
The negotiations on ﬁ nancial proposal shall include the remuneration rates for staff 
(breakdown of fees such as salary, social costs, overheads, fee that is proﬁ t, and any 
premium or allowance paid), proposed unit rates and quantities for reimbursable.
If the negotiations fail to result in an acceptable contract, the CSC shall terminate the 
negotiations and invite the next ranked Consultant for negotiations. The PE shall inform 
the Consultant of the reasons for termination of the negotiations. Once negotiations 
are commenced with the next ranked Consultant, the CPC shall not reopen the earlier 
negotiations. After negotiations are successfully completed, the CSC shall make 
their ﬁ nal determination of the contract award. After this determination, the PE shall 
promptly notify other ﬁ rms on the short list that they were unsuccessful.
The CSC shall keep a record of matters agreed with the Consultant during negotiations 
and the PE shall execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the Consultant relating 
to the agreed negotiated terms and conditions, which subsequently shall be included 
as contract terms.

7.14 Combined Evaluation Report
Refer 
Manual
7.14
Immediately after the evaluation is completed the CSC should prepare a Combined Evaluation 
Report and recommendation/determination of contract award in the prescribed format and submit 
to the relevant authority for the approval.
7.15 Rejection of all Proposals Received
If all proposals are found to be nonresponsive, the CSC may be justi ﬁ ed in rejecting all of them. 
The grounds for rejecting all proposals are as follows:
 (i) The proposals present major de ﬁ ciencies in complying with the RFP.
 (ii) All proposals fail to achieve the minimum qualifying mark (technical score) indicated 
in the RFP. 
 (iii) The proposal prices are substantially higher than the PE’s estimated budget.
There may be technical reasons for the deﬁ ciencies. Most frequently, the PE and Consultants disagree 
on which contractual party should be responsible for executing speci ﬁ c assignment activities or 
on the exact content and feasibility of speci ﬁ c deadlines affecting the implementation schedule 
of the PE’s project. In other instances, Consultants may ﬁ nd the estimated staff-months and the 
distribution of risks unacceptable.
And also, the PE may not know the ongoing remuneration levels of Consultants for the type of service 
being considered, Consultants may misinterpret the TOR, or the PE’s plans may be too ambitious 
for the available budget. In this case, before rejecting all proposals, the PE, should investigate the 
feasibility of increasing the budget or scaling down the scope of services to meet the original budget.
In all cases, good TOR, accurate budget, and review of the RFP can reduce the risks of nonresponsive 
proposals.
If all proposals rejected, the new process may start and include revising the TOR, RFP (including 
the short list) and the budget. Calling for new proposals creates obvious delays and should remain 
the last resort.
CAO’s prior approval shall be obtained before rejecting all proposals and to start the new process.

8.3 Debrieﬁ ng
The Purposes of debrieﬁ ng are to:
(a) Inform the aggrieved Consultant who requests for a debrie ﬁ ng during the standstill pe-
riod, of the reasons for not being successful, pointing out the speci ﬁ c shortcomings in 
its proposal without disclosing contents of other proposals, with the overall objective of 
educating the Consultant to submit more responsive and competitive proposals in future.
(b) Minimize the level of complaints and to demonstrate clearly the principle and practice 
of probity and transparency.
(c) After the noti ﬁ cation of contract award, a Consultant who wishes to ascertain the grounds 
on which its proposal was not selected should address its request to the PE.

9.6 Types of Contracts
PEs spend substantial funds on various type of Consulting Services and therefore need to consider 
how best to structure the contracts for those services. 
Three main considerations determine what type of contract to adopt in a Consultant assignment: 
as follows;
a) the nature of the assignment,
b) the distribution of risks and rewards between the Procuring Entity and the Consultant, and
c) the circumstances of the PE and of the Consultant. The level of capacity in contract man-
agement and Consulting Services supervision that the PE will be able to provide may also 
be a factor in the choice.
The following contract types based on payment conditions may be used as appropriate;
• Lump-sum contract
• Time-based contract
• Retainer and/or (success) fee contract
• Percentage contract
• Indeﬁ nite-delivery contract (IDC)
Each type is described brie ﬂ y in the Manual, as well as the criteria that are suggested for their 
adoption and correct application.
