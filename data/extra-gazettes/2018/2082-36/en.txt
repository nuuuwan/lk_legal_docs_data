The witness further stated that the previous employer was The Finance Company but in R10 it was erro rneously
stated as The Finance and Gurantee Company.
The witness further admitted that the respondent company has not challenged the order given by the Commissioner
of Labour in the Court of Appeal.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to following conclusions.
I. It is evident that the Applicant has worked for the Respondent Company for a period of 11 years 01.0 7.1998 to
31.05.2010. According to the Gratuity act No 12 of 1983 she was paid a sum of Rs. 1,604,879.82 far in excess what
she was entitled under Gratuity Act.
II. It is evident that the Applicant  as a senior accountant obtaining an excessive sum of Rs. 1,604,879 .82 as the
Gratuity was improper.
III. It is clear that the Commissioner of Labour has no power to order to calculate the gratuity in exces s half month
salary for a year in service as stipulated in the Gratuity Act.
IV . It is evident that gratuity become liable in terms of payment of Gratuity Act only when there is a termination of
employment, since there has been no termination of service of the applicant it is not justifiable to calculate a sum
of Rs. 223,125/= as her gratuity from her previous employer - The Finance Company PLC.
V . It is evident that the Applicant's employment with the Respondent Company was a new one.
VI. The Applicant has acted unfairly and fraudulently by obtaining the gratuity far in excess what she w as entitled
under the Payment of Gratuity Act.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the Respondent Company (party of the second part) ha s caused no
injustice to the applicant. (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I dismiss the complaint made
by the Applciant.
I  Further make order that this award should be implemented within 21 days of the publication in the Government
Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award just and equitable.
