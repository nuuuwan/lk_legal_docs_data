SCHEDULE    2
GUIDELINE   FOR   THE    COMPUTATION   OF    INCOME    TAX    PAYABLE   BY   PARTNERSHIPS
(1) A Partnership shall be liable to pay income tax in respect of its taxable income (including any gains from the realization
of any investment assets) with effect from 01.01.2020. However, the computation and payment of Income Tax Liability
on the realization of any investment asset of the partnership for the year of assessment shall be made as provided in
the IRA (No changes to the respective provisions have been made).
(2) Subject to the condition given under paragraph 3, all partnerships are required to compute its assessable income
(other than any gains from the realization of any investment assets) for the year of assessment and should apportion
the same between the two periods as for the First Period and for the Second Period according to the pro-rata basis
based on the time period (3/4th to the First Period and 1/4th to the Second Period).
However, if the partnership received or derived any amounts which are exempted as per the amendments provided in
the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No.10 of 2021 for the Second Period, 1/4
th of the total amounts received or
derived during the year from such source can be excluded as exempted amount and the balance, 3/4 th of the total
amount, should be recognized for the First Period. Expenditures and related deductions which would be deductible
from such exempted amounts and disallowable under Section 10(1)(b)(iv) of the IRA, should be identified by pro-
rating such total expenditures and deductions based on the time period (3/4th for the First Period and 1/4th for the
Second Period).
(3) If the partners of the partnership are individuals, then partnerships are allowed to exclude the actual interest and
actual dividend received or derived during the First Period as final withholding payments. In such a situation, actual
interest and actual dividend received or derived during the Second Period is not required to apportion over the two
periods, but should be recognized for the taxable income of the partnership for the Second Period. It is required to

partnership (for second period) shall be calculated by applying the relevant tax rates set out below.

First 250,000 0
Balance 6 %
(6) If the partnership has allocated any share of partnership income to its partners during the First Period, Withholding
Tax shall be paid as provided by Section 84(1)(a)(ii) of the IRA on such allocated amounts (such Withholding Tax shall
be paid as provided in Section 86 of the IRA and late payments are resulting to impose interest or penalty). If not, for
the purpose of the IRA, the allocation occurs as at the end of the Year of Assessment and no withholding tax liability
will be attached with such share of partnership income.
(7) Subject to the condition stated in paragraph 3 above, in calculating the income tax liability of a partner in a partnership,
the partner’s share of any partnership income (including loss) and any share of qualifying payments shall be included
or deducted; as the case may be; and the taxable income of the partner shall be computed separately for the two
periods of the year of assessment. Non final withholding taxes (including partnership withholding tax paid if any) or
any tax credit entitled by the partner during the First Period can be deducted from the respective income tax liability
and a refund can be claimed (subject to the respective provisions of the IRA before the amendments) if any on such
tax credits. Income tax paid by the partnership as an installment for the taxable income of the partnership will be
allocated to the partners according to the share of partnership income of the Second Period and be treated as a tax
credit to the partner in a partnership. If there is any excess tax credit after the deduction of share of income tax paid by
the partnership in computing the income tax payable by the partner, no refund shall be made but such excess income
tax credit is allowable to carry forward by the partner.
SCHEDULE    3
GUIDELINE FOR   THE   COMPUTATION   OF    INCOME   TAX   PAYABLE BY   PERSONS   OTHER   THAN
INDIVIDUALS   AND    PARTNERSHIPS
(1) For the purpose of following instructions, Company includes corporation, clubs/association, Non-Governmental
Organizations, Charitable Institutions, Funds, Trusts or Unit Trusts and entities other than partnerships.
(2) Company shall compute the assessable income and taxable income for the year of assessment without separating in
to two periods of First period and Second Period.
(3) If the company received or derived any amounts which are exempted as per the amendments provided in the Inland
Revenue (Amendment) Act, No.10 of 2021 for the Second Period, 1/4
th of the total amounts received or derived during
the year from such source can be excluded as exempted amount in arriving at the taxable income for the year of
assessment. The balance amount (tax adjusted gains and profits) in relation to such part of source (3/4
th of the total
amounts of the year) can be recognized for the First Period. Actual dividend income received or derived during the
First Period shall also be excluded as a final withholding payment. Expenditures and related deductions which would
be deductible from such exempted amounts or from final withholding payments and disallowable under Section
10(1)(b)(iv) of the IRA, should be identified by pro-rating such total expenditures and deductions based on the time
period (3/4
th for the First Period and 1/4th for the Second Period).
(4) Taxable income computed as per the instruction given under paragraph 3 is required to apportion over the two periods
by applying the pro-rata basis based on the time period. However, actual dividend income received or derived

during the Second Period is not required to apportion over the two periods but should be recognized for the taxable
income of the Second Period.
(5) If there is a loss from business or a particular investment, a company shall compute its assessable income or loss
separately (notwithstanding the guidelines provided under paragraph 2, 3 and 4) for each businesses or investment;
as the case may be; for the purpose of deducting relevant losses as provided by section 19 of the IRA. In such a
situation, business income, investment income or loss from each activity should be apportioned on the pro-rata basis
based on time as 3/4
th for the First Period and 1/4th for the Second Period. Total assessable income shall be computed
separately for two periods by deducting the allowable losses subject to the provisions of the IRA. Taxable income
shall also be computed separately to apply the income tax rates appropriately in computing the income tax payable.
(6) Income tax payable by the company for its taxable income shall separately be calculated for two periods by applying
the relevant rates of income tax. Accordingly, Income tax rates as per the IRA prior to the amendment should be
applied for the First Period and income tax rates set out in the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 10 of 2021
should be applied for the Second Period.
(7) For applying the special tax rates set out in item (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of subparagraph 2 of Paragraph 4 of the First
Schedule of the IRA for the First Period, required base of “predominance” shall be calculated based on the actual
gross income of the First Period.
(8) Subject to the provisions of the IRA, foreign tax credit, non-final withholding tax credit and other tax credits granted
or allowed can be deducted from the amount of total tax payable to calculate the income tax payable by the company
for the year of assessment 2019/2020.
(9) If any company received the Commissioner-General’s approval to submit accounts based on an alternative period of
twelve months other than from April 01, 2019 to March 31, 2020 and to be used to compute the income tax payable for
year of assessment 2019/2020, above instructions can appropriately be applied for the relevant two periods of the
accounts as for the period prior to 01.01.2020 (First Period) and for the period on or after 01.01.2020 (Second Period).
Therefore, the First Period is the number of months from the commencing date of the accounting year to 31.12.2019
and the Second Period is the number of months from 01.01.2020 to ending date of the accounting year.
(10) Charitable Institutions are allowed to exclude the actual interest income received or derived during the First Period as
a final withholding payment. The expenditures and related deductions which would be deductible from such final
withholding payments and disallowable amounts under Section 10(1)(b)(iv) of the IRA, should be identified by pro-
rating such total expenditures and deductions based on the time period (3/4
th for the First Period and 1/4 th for the
Second Period). Actual interest income received or derived during the Second Period is not required to apportion over
the two periods but should be recognized for the taxable income of the Second Period.
