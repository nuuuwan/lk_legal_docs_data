Greetings !
While considering that the complex, lengthy procedures and mechanisms for issuing permits, licenses and approvals,
have a negative impact on the overall development process,
And, while focusing on the fact that these diverse, protracted, regulatory procedures create disruptions to the lives
of ordinary people and to everyday livelihoods,
And, under those circumstances, and in a situation which is overly regulated and where the money, time and labour
that can be used for the development is not productively utilized, there is a possibility for creating space for irregular
practices and corruption,
And, recognizing the need to redesign these complex circulars, laws and regulations in a people-friendly manner in
order to facilitate community life and take the country towards rapid development,
Now, therefore, I, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, reposing great
trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity, appoint you said :-
1. Lalith Weeratunga Esquire
Principal Advisor to the President
2. S.D.A.B. Boralessa Esquire
Secretary, State Ministry of Land Management, State Enterprises Land and Property Development
3. M.M.C. Ferdinando Esquire
Retired Ministry Secretary, Power Sector
4. Krishan Balendra Esquire
Chairman, John Keells Group
5. Suresh de Mel Esquire
Chairman, Export Development Board
6. Ms. J.C. Weligamage
Director General, Department of Public Finance
7. Chandana Kumarasinghe Esquire
Director General of Establishments, Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local Government
