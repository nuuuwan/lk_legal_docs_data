THE   2021   PROHIBITED LIST
WORLD    ANTI-DOPING    CODE
V ALID  1  JANUARY  2021
Introduction
The Prohibited List is a mandatory International Standard as part of the World Anti-Doping Program.
The List is updated annually following an extensive consultation process facilitated by W ADA. The effective date of the List
is 01 January  2021.
The official text of the Prohibited List shall be maintained by W ADA and shall be published in English and French. In the
event of any conflict between the English and French versions, the English version shall prevail.
Below are some terms used in this List of Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods.
Prohibited In-Competition
Subject to a different period having been approved by W ADA for a given sport, the In - Competition period shall in principle
be the period commencing just before midnight (at 11:59 p.m.) on the day before a Competition in which the Athlete is
scheduled to participate until the end of the Competition and the Sample collection process.
Prohibited at all times
This means that the substance or method is prohibited In- and Out-of-Competition as defined in the Code.
Specified and non-Specified
As per Article 4.2.2 of the World Anti-Doping Code, "for purposes of the application of Article 10, all Prohibited Substances
shall be Specified Substances except as identified on the Prohibited List. No Prohibited Method shall be a Specified Method
unless it is specifically identified as a Specified Method on the Prohibited List". As per the comment to the article, "the
Specified Substances and Methods identified in Article 4.2.2 should not in any way be considered less important or less
dangerous than other doping substances or methods. Rather, they are simply substances and methods which are more likely
to have been consumed or used by an Athlete for a purpose other than the enhancement of sport performance."
Substances of Abuse
Pursuant to Article 4.2.3 of the Code, Substances of Abuse are substances that are identified as such because they are
frequently abused in society outside of the context of sport. The following are designated Substances of Abuse: cocaine,
diamorphine (heroin), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/"ecstasy"), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
