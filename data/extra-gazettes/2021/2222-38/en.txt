PART  I : Sec (I) –  GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 07.04.2021 
Basis for Opinion 
 
I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities u nder those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial sta tements section of my 
report. I am independent of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of  Ethics issued by CA 
Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have ful filled my other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obt ained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. 
 
Other Information 
 
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information inc luded in the 
Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. 
 
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
 
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other info rmation and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have  performed, I conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in 
this regard. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view  in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary t o enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud o r error. In preparing 
the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continu e as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of acc ounting unless 
Management either intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those c harged with 
governance are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s financial reporting process. 
  
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opini on. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SLAuSs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error an d are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the ec onomic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain profess ional skepticism 
throughout the audit. I also: 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to f raud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf ficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement res ulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentio nal omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
  
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedure s that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiven ess of the 
Institute’s internal control.

PART  I : Sec (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 07.04.2021 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estima tes and 
related disclosures made by management. 
  
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the I nstitute to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
  
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that a chieves fair 
presentation. 
  
I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control tha t I identify during my 
audit.

PART  I : Sec (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 07.04.2021 
  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estim ates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that per iod or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 Information about significant  areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying ac counting 
policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statement s is as 
follows. 
 
 a)  Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) and Accounting for Association of Public 
Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) 
  When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to  all 
factors and circumstances in SLFRS 10- “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows; 
 (a)  power over the investee 
 (b)  exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
 (c)  the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. 
  Accordingly, Management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to varia ble 
returns from its involvement with AAT or APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation. 
 
 b)  Defined Benefit Plans 
  The cost of the retirement benefit plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC)  
method. Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary incr ease 
and retirement age. Due to the long - term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. 
 
 c)  Changes in Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
  Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to t he 
financial statements.

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 2.1 Assets and the Bases of Their Valuation 
 
 2.1.1 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
 (a)  Basis of Recognition andMeasurement 
  Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associa ted with 
the asset will flow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
  All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost les s 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are recognised in th e 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment a re 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not  be 
recoverable. 
 
 (b)  Depreciation 
  Depreciation is calculated by using a straight -line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, 
in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets. 
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows; 
 
Asset Category Useful Life 
  (Years) 
Buildings 50 
Furniture 5- 10 
Plant and Machinery 5-10 
Motor vehicles 10 
Computers, Servers & IT equipment 5 
 
  Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset 
is classified as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised. 
 
  Significant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identi fied and 
depreciated. 
 
  Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is a mortised over the useful life  of 
the related asset. 
 
 (c)  De recognition 
  An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the ass et is 
calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the 
statement of comprehensive income in the year, the as set is derecognised. 
 
 2.1.2 Library Books 
  Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years. 
 2.1.3 Capital Work-In-Progress 
  Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital nature, 
directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capi tal work-in-
progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is available 
for use i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating i n the manner 
intended by the Institute.

PART  I : Sec (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 07.04.2021 
 2.1.4 Intangible Assets 
 a.  Computer Software 
  Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use. 
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of five to ten (5-10) years. 
 
  Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incur red. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met: 
 1. It is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; 
 2. Management intends to complete the software product and use it; 
 3. there is an ability to use the software product; 
 4. it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; 
 5. adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software product 
are available; and 
 6. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. 
  Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the softwar e development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. 
  Costs recognized as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed ten 
(10) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress until the software is 
ready for use. 
 
 b. Study Material 
  Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA qualifications 
are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new curriculum,  the 
investment attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably measured and it can be 
demonstrated that it will generate probable future economic benefits. 
 
  These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful life is reviewed at 
least at each financial reporting year end. 
 
 2.1.5 Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and 
slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business  less the 
estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on weighted aver age cost. 
The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their exist ing location 
and condition. 
  The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables. 
 2.1.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
  The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such 
indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its  recoverable amount. In

PART  I : Sec (I) –  GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 07.04.2021 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a discount rate 
that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. 
 
  Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income i n those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 
 
  A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates  used to 
determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is t he case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot “ex ceed” the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been re cognised 
for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
2.1.7 Financial Assets - Initial Recognition and Measurement 
 
 (a) SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
  SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 on “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018, bringing together all three aspects 
of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge  
accounting. 
 
 (b) Financial Assets 
  The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contr actual cash 
flow characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With  the exception of trade 
receivables that do not contain significant financing component for which  the Institute has applied the 
practical expedient, the Institute initially measures financial assets at their fair value plus transaction costs. 
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component for which the Institute has applied 
the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under SLFRS 15. 
 
  In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through  OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Institute’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages financial 
assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result  from 
collecting contractual cash flows or selling the financial assets or both. 
 
  Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statemen t of 
Financial Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts  and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
 
  The financial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, fixed deposi ts held to 
collect contractual cash flows, government securities, repurchase agreements and cash and cash equivalents. 
 
  The Institute’s financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of both of the 
following conditions: 
 
 a) The financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in  
order to collect contractual cash flows and 
 b) The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are so lely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding 
 
 Accordingly, financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) 
method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the ass et is 
derecognised, modified or impaired.

PART  I : Sec (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 07.04.2021 
 2.1.8 Derecognition of Financial Assets 
  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of an Institute of simi lar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised when: 
 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or 
 The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass -through’ 
arrangement; and either 
 a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
 b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset. 
  When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered int o a  
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset , nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its 
continuing involvement. In that case, the Institute  also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset 
and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Institute has  
retained. 
  Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of 
the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Institute  could be 
required to repay. 
 
 2.1.9 Impairment of Financial Assets 
  The Institute recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments measured at 
amortized cost. 
  ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contr act and 
all the cash flows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation  of the original effective 
interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit 
enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. 
  For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. 
 
 2.1.10 Reclassification 
  Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the Management intends to hold these instruments to collect 
the contractual cash flows upon completion of the SPPI test and evaluating the historical data. As o f 01 st 
January 2018, the Institute has elected the business model of hold to collect the contractual cash f lows and 
measured the instruments at amortized cost. 
  Prior to 01 st January 2018 financial assets were classified as held to maturity and available for sale. In 
complying with SLFRS 9, financial assets are reclassified at amortised cost. Cumulative balance in A FS 
reserve is removed and is used to adjust the reclassified  amortised cost. EIR determined at initial recognition 
and gross carrying amount are not adjusted as a result of reclassification. 
  Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in th ose rare 
circumstances when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such finan cial 
assets. 
  Consequent to the change in the business model, the Institute reclassifies all affected assets prosp ectively from 
the first day of the next reporting period (the reclassification date). Prior periods are not restated.

 2.1.11 Financial Liabilities 
  All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair v alue through 
profit or loss. The Institute does not have financial liabilities for the year ended 31st December 2020. 
 
 2.1.12 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short -term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayab le on 
demand and form an integral part of the Institute’s cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements. 
  Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash 
flows, which has been prepared using the 'indirect method'. 
 
 2.2 Liabilities and Provisions 
  A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle ; held 
primarily for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporti ng period or 
there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period. The Institute classifies all other liabilities as non-current. 
 
 2.2.1 Deferred Income 
  Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes are raised at the 
commencement of the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months. Deferred 
income is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken  place 
and the balance attributable to the remaining course period is recognized as a liability on the stat ement of 
financial position until income is recognized. 
 
 2.2.2. Provisions 
  A provision is recognized in the statement of financial position, when Institute has a legal or cons tructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to  settle the 
obligation and the obligation can be measured reliably. 
 
 2.2.3 Employee Benefits 
 (a) Employee Defined Benefit Plan - Gratuity 
  Defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan, other than a defined contribution plan. The 
defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. Th e 
present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future ca sh 
outflows, using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and 
that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. The present value o f the 
defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis  
using a number of assumptions about discount rate, future salary increments  and mortality rates. Due to 
the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date. Accordingly, the employee benefit liability is based on the actuarial 
valuation as of 31 December 2020. The Institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognise actuarial 
gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive  
income. 
 
 (b) Defined Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund 
  Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund 
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognized as an expense in the 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross 
emoluments of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively.

 2.2.4 Taxation 
 (a) Income Tax 
  The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 
of 2017. 
 (b) Other Taxes 
  VAT has been paid in respect of rent received by the Institute, letting of movable or immovable prop erty, 
being the only taxable activity carried on by the Institute. Since the Institute is not engaged in carrying on 
a trade or a business, the Institute is not liable for Economic Service Charge or Nation Building Ta x. 
Therefore, no provision has been made for any other taxes. 
 
 (c) Deferred Taxation 
  Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed against 
the liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable income. Defer red tax

  Withdrawals are not made other than at maturity. Any early withdrawal requires the approval of the 
investment committee. 
 
 iii. Fund Usage Policy: 
  Usage is restricted for the specific purpose for which the fund was established. 
 
 2.3.4 Grants 
 2.3.4.1 Land Received as a Government Grant: 
  Government grants for non-monetary assets are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant 
will be received and all attached conditions have been complied with. 
  The method adopted for accounting for Government grant is income approach, where the grant relating to non-
depreciable asset is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
  Fair value is treated as deemed cost of the land at the date of the recognition of Government grant given in the 
financial statements.

  Grants and subsidies related to assets are generally deferred in the statement of financial position  and credited 
to the statement of comprehensive income over the useful life of the asset. 
 
 2.4 Statement of Comprehensive Income 
 
 2.4.1 Income Recognition 
 (a) Income 
  The sources of revenue of CA Sri Lanka is recognised as per SLFRS 15 on “ Revenue from contracts with 
customers”. Accordingly, SLFRS 15 establishes five step model to account for revenue  recognition at an 
amount that reflect the consideration where CA Sri Lanka expects to provide services to its stakeholders. The 
Institute has adopted SLFRS 15 using the full retrospective method based on the assessment performed  and 
decided that the impact is not material  to the financial statements and therefore adjustment has not been made 
in the retained earnings opening balance of the statement of changes in funds and reserves. 
 
  In terms of SLFRS 15, Revenue is recognised upon satisfactory performance obligation is achieved. CA  Sri 
Lanka expects that, the revenue recognition to occur over time where stakeholders (mainly students a nd 
members) simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by CA Sri Lanka and when the 
Institute has an enforceable right to receive payment for performance completed. Otherwise, the reve nue of 
the Institute is recognised at point in time.

Note 32 - COVID 19 Disclosure          
Since the start of January 2020, the COVID 19 outbreak has created disruption to our operations and our key stakeholders 
such as members, students, suppliers and other customers. We understand the difficulties this poses and have put 
measures in place to support them through this challenging time. Depending on how the situation deve lops, there is a 
potential for any associated economic slowdown which would impact our educational activities. We for esee possible 
reductions in the revenue due to decrease in the student enrolment and volume of transactions taking  place, and potential 
losses stemming from disruption to our stakeholder base. We continue to monitor the situation closel y and develop 
strategies to turnaround. 
Health and Safety Measures 
In response to the COVID 19 outbreak, CA Sri Lanka’s priority is to ensure the health and safety of our stakeholders that 
include members, students and employees and continue normal operations by leveraging our robust busi ness continuity 
plans. 
Furthermore, we have had to incur expenses that were otherwise unplanned in response to COVID -19.  These related 
costs may include, but are not limited to: 
● Institute cleaning and disinfecting 
● Shifting to a distance learning platform, including licenses for delivery software 
● Training and professional development 
● Screening of Institute visitors 
● Unplanned student costs such as storage 
● Additional IT infrastructure facilities for staff due to work-from-home arrangements 
           
Economic Impact 
The economic impact of the COVID 19 outbreak will depend on how the virus spreads and heavily depend s on the 
response of the Government, Sri Lankan regulators and the relevant authorities. Being a responsible corporate citizen 
involved in the betterment of the accounting profession, CA Sri Lanka always takes all the possible measures in adhering 
to the high quality education guidelines and the regulations. 
Financial Impact 
The outbreak will have an impact on the financials of CA Sri Lanka in the year 2020. CA Sri Lanka is  compelled to 
postpone or conduct subject to compliance with the regulations imposed by the authorities of many of  its flagship events 
in the calendar of CA Sri Lanka including Annual Report Awards Competition and National Conference. Further, we had 
to curtail CA examinations, seminars and workshops and other short courses due to the restrictions i mposed by the 
government adhering to the health regulations. In that context, CA Sri Lanka has moved more into dig ital means to 
provide a value added service to its stakeholders. 
As a result of these effects our cumulative revenue in the first six months of 2020 was approximately 46% lower than our 
2019 revenues in the same period with the major negative impact identified in March and April 2020.
