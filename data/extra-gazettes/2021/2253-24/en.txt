The Applicant is requesting to back date the Chief Engineer post from 2009 or 2010.
he further said all the Applicant who were interviewed on 2010 were given post of Chief engineer.
Senior Human Resource Officer Ms. Kanthi Balage has stated as follows.
The witness said that the Applicant obtained 43rd place out of 55 who faced the interview for the Post of Chief engineer only 
up to 32nd were selected as the Chief engineer.
The witness said that the Applicant did not forward any application for the Post of Chief engineer during the period 2009 
to 2012.
she further said the Applicant came to sri Lanka on october, 2012. Then he was interviewed and on 01.04.2013 he was 
appointed as a Chief engineer she further said it was a special interview only for the Applicant.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to following conclusions.
 i. The Applicant joined National water supply and drainage board on 01.03.2001 as a Civil engineer. he left to 
Thailand on 10.08.2009 in 2009 he was not successful in the Chief engineer interview. he was in overseas on 
10.08.2009 to 30.04.2011. The Applicant returned to sri Lanka in 2012 and faced an interview on 01.04.2013 
and got promoted to the Post of Chief engineer.
 ii. The Applicant could not apply for the Post of Chief engineer during the period 2009 to 2013 as he was overseas.
 iii. The respondent has not acted unfairly towards the applicant as the Applicant could not face the Chief engineer 
interview as he was in overseas from 10.08.2009 to 30.04.2011.
In the cicumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. edirisinghe (1991) that 
the arbitrator has not made an award which is just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the contract  
of employment. he can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect of the award is to 
introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator creates a new 
contracts for the future in contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract. An industrial 
arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force in the future when he cannot get the 
parties to agree to them in contact to a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the Respondent, National Water Supply and Drainage Board Road (party of 
the second Part) has caused no injustice to the Applicant, mr. e. Jegadeesan. (party of the First Part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the First 
part : mr. e. Jegadeesan is not entitled to any relief by not given the post of Chief engineer before 01.04.2013.
I Consider this award is just and equitable.
