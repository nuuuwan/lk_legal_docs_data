Greetings !
Whereas the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received for the overall policy framework and proposals
set out in the Cabinet Memorandum presented by His Excellency the President on 27th April,  2021 to transform Sri Lanka into
a Green Socio-economy with Sustainable Solutions for Climate Changes,
And whereas, a popular verdict has been given in order to meet the challenges posed having regard to the matters
relating to the use of fertilizer, lands, biodiversity, atmosphere, waste, industries, renewable energy, settlements & towns and
environmental education that have been emphatically referred to in the policy statement: “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”.
Taking into account the fact that no relatively good quality production is secured in spite of the colossal amount
being currently expended nationally on chemical fertilizer, weedicides and pesticides and matters such as the pollution of
water due to its excessive use causing onset of diseases affecting health of the people resulting in their being deprived of
their means of livelihood and the difficulties increasingly experienced by them in securing toxin-free foods.
Focusing on the need to retain within the country the foreign exchange being drawn away on importation of
chemical fertilizer, fuel, plastics, chemical substances and the benefits that could be derived nationally and internationally by
the launch of a programme for improving biodiversity in Sri Lanka and eco-friendly healthy means of livelihood by utilization
of organic and natural fertilizer and the potential for sustainable development by minimizing climate changes and through a
green economy,
And whereas, Sri Lanka’s access to a green socio-economic pattern providing sustainable solutions needs to be
prioritized so as to make people adapt themselves to an eco-friendly socio-economic pattern in order for the country to reap
benefits from the prevailing highly favourable conditions in the global economy in the context of the emerging global
economic trends.
Now, therefore, I, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, reposing great
trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity, appoint you the said :-
1. Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera Esquire, M. P.
Minister of Environment
2. Hon. Duminda Dissanayaka Esquire, M. P.
State Minister of Solar Power, Wind and Hydro Power Generation Projects Development
3. Hon. Arundika Fernando Esquire, M. P.
State Minister of Coconut, Kithul and Palmyrah Cultivation Promotion and Related Industrial Product
