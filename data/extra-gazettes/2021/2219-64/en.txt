under HM 2 -1 for Deputy Director/Deputy Principal, HM 1 -1 six position of which Chief, Engineer, Services 
and Maintenance and not Chief Engineer, Production, Maintenance and Technological Innovations. 
 
 Management on many occasions have written to National Wages and Cadre Commission, as well as to Dept. of 
Management Services to rectify this anamoly, since without approval from Dept. of Management Service s, no 
change could be made. 
 
 However after several requests Dept. of Management Services instructed to place the Chief Engineer in MM 1-1. 
 
 Under cross examination, she accepts that all 3 applicants were in Grade 3A of Ceylon German Technic al

conversions.

PART I –  SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIS T REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 19.03.2021 
Treasury Secretary's directions are quite clear in that, the highest person in authority in the esta blishment is 
required to be present with all details concerning the roles and functions of it's employees. 
 
 It is not clear who attended the discussion, but whoever it is present position is in a jumble, sinc e accurate 
situation performed by the staff members have not come into focus thereby serious damage is caused to some. 
 
 Paradoxically, circular no. 30 is in conflict with provisions of the Establishment Code, in that it specifically 
exclude application of provision to employees of statutory boards and corporation and institution vested in the 
government. This circular expects, Managements to follow Establishment Code in relation to conversions -
Definition of "Public Officer" explains. 
 
 There is no University in Sri Lanka, which awards degrees in Automobile Engineering. But the Scheme of 
recruitment formulated by the Ceylon German Technical Training Institute in 30.11.2012 and 30.07.2014 (R 27 
A) required a degree, when there is no University, or a Chief Engineer (Production, Services and mai ntenance). 
It is unfair to backdate these requirements to employees who worked in 2006. 
 
 In reality both applicants G. K. M. Ananda and H.  Sunil Perera, who held very senior positions, cou nt several 
years of practical experience. 
  
 G. H. M. Ananda, had joined as a trainee on 02.05.1968 and his rise is briefly. 
 
(a) After  training, absorbed to Ceylon Transport Board. 
 
(b) On 02.05.1972-Gr. II Technician at Ceylon German Technical Training Institute. 
 
(c) On 01.08.1974 promoted to II Level student leader. 
 
(d) On 01.11.1975 promoted to I Class in Grade II  as Senior Exhibiter. 
 
(e) On 28.12.1979 selected for Grade VIII as Junior Supervisor. 
 
(f) On 15.03.1984 promoted to Senior Supervisor, Grade VI A. 
 
(g) On 12.09.2006 appointed as Chief Engineer  (Motor mechanism) Grade III A. 
 
(h) Assigned further duties, as New technologies, Production  and Development Chief Engineer. 
 
 H Sunil Perera had joined Ceylon German Technical Training Institute as a trainee with effect from 16.03.1967, 
and after training he had been retained. 
 
(a) On 05.12.1979  he was placed in Grade VIII as a foreman. 
 
(b) On 01.06.1982 promoted to Grade VI foreman. 
 
(c) In 1987 promoted to Grade V Engineer. 
 
(d) In 1980 promoted to Grade  IV Trainer Engineer. 
 
(e) In 1993 promoted to Grade III B Senior Technical Officer. 
 
(f) In 2000 promoted to Grade III A Chief Factory Engineer.  
 
 Both applicants had been from lowest strata and risen to most Senior positions in the organization. Although 
Ceylon German Technical Training Institute is not registered as a University, the ground training as  well as 
theoretical training imparted to the students, surpass that’s given in a University, If it was recog nized as a 
University, these two would have been Senior Professors in Automobile Engineering.

 The Institute called applications to fill in the Post of Deputy Director/Deputy Principal. Both were  qualified, so 
they applied but were not selected. As far as the interview is concerned, Management had not formula ted a 
marking criteria-Page 527 in file. 
 
 In order to evaluate the work performed, management should have obtained from each and every executi ve, a 
detailed account of the duties and management had failed to do so. In the process severe damage had happened 
to these two Senior Officers.-Page 416 
 
 The respondents witness Ms. Damayanthi Asst. Manager Administration & Human Resources, failed in 
answering several vital questions put to her -pages 407, 408, 410, 411, 412, 413, 415, 428. Management should 
have taken more serious initiative in resolving these matters. 
 
 Management cautiously avoided sending  a suitable person of responsibility to give evidence, special ly it 
involved more of technological assessments. Either the Principal or a competent person in the organi zation 
would have been ideal, since it is observed that denying placement in HM -1-1 in the scale was a serious unfair 
labour practice. 
 
 Mrs. D. M. P. D. Perera's claims have been already accepted by the management of the Institute. Also  K. D. L. 
Somadasa failed to give evidence and no expects no decision from arbitrator. 
 
 
7. Award 
 
 I have  examined the evidence, both oral and documents compare hensively and is of the view that 3 applicants,                   
Mrs. D. M. P. B. Perera, Mr. G. H. M. Ananda and Mr. H. Sunil Perera be placed in HM -1-1 salary scale, with 
effect from the operative date up to date of retirement. Arreas of salary, computed and deposited wi th the Asst. 
Commissioner of labour  (Colombo South) Labour Secretariat, Narahenpita, Colombo 05, within 45 days,  once 
the award is published in the Government Gazette. 
 
 In relation to Gratuity, Employees Provided Fund and Employees Trust Fund, action to be pursued by t he 
Commissioner General of  Labour, dependent upon the salary placement and payment of arreas. 
 
 This is just and a fair award.
