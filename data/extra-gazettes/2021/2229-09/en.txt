(a) by the repeal of Rule 4 thereof and the substitution therefor, of the following new Rules-
“4. Every exporter of goods shall, within thirty (30) days upon the receipt of such export proceeds into Sri
Lanka as required under Rule 3 above, convert not less than Twenty- five per centum (25%) from and out of the
total of the said export proceeds received in Sri Lanka, into Sri Lanka Rupees, through a licensed bank”.
“4A. The Monetary Board may however determine  the  specific  export  sectors or  industries or individual
exporters, who or which may be permited to convert less than twenty five per centum of the total of the export
proceeds received in Sri Lanka, if the
 Monetary Board is satisfied, in its discretion, that the export goods and
processes of such export sector, industry or exporter, utilize a very high percentage of imported goods that cannot
be sourced domestically.
Provided however, that in no instance, shall any such partial exemption that  the
 Monetary Board may grant in
its discretion, as referred to immediately above, be below ten per centum  (10%)  of the total export  proceeds”.
“4B. Such date of conversion mentioned in Rule 4 and 4A above, shall not be a date later than the date before
which the export proceeds shall be received in Sri Lanka, as required by Rule 3 (i) above (i. e., not later than One
Hundred and Eighty (180) days from the date of shipment)”.
(b) by the repeal of Rule 5 thereof and the substitution therefor, of the following new Rule-
“5. The Monetary Board may in general, having regard to the liquidity situation in the foreign exchange
market and the Gross Official Reserve levels in Sri Lanka, determine from time to time, such other percentage as
the case may be, of the export proceeds received in Sri Lanka,  that shall be converted into Sri Lanka Rupees
through a Licensed Bank as the Monetary Board may deem fit and appropriate in the prevailing circumstances”.
