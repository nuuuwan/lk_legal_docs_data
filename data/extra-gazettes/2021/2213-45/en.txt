6. Observations and Findings 
 
(a) Lanka Hotel Corporation (Repeal) Act, No.25 of 2007, came into effect on 12 th July, 2007 and affairs were 
taken over by Galle face Hotel Management (Pvt)Ltd. After series of discussion with Trade Unions a 
Voluntary Retirement Scheme was devised, which offered to workmen, Rupees Six hundred thousand 
(Rs.600,000.00), per pax of the to tal workforce of 400, Three hundred  accepted the offer, The Voluntary 
Retirement formula required payment to be completed within two year period. Inter Companies Employees 
Union, Sri Lanka Nidahas Sewaka Sangamaya and Jathik a Sewaka Sangamaya are th e unions who had agreed 
the settlement formula. 
 
(b) On behalf of 26 employees, Four applicants submitted sworn affidavits. 
 They failed to annex relevant documents to establish their position. Besides, most essential following items 
were ignored in evidence. They are - 
 
 (i) Letters of appointment of any of the workmen not produced in evidence; 
 (ii) Photo copies of certain documents, have not been certified by the management as true copies (An error 
in the face of record): 
 (iii) None from the new management, i.e. Galle Face Hotel Management (Pvt)Ltd. have not been requested 
to testify at the proceedings concerning the verbal assurances. 
 
(c) Commissioner General of Labour, is th e enforcement authority to deal with in relation to the Budgetary Relief 
Allowance Act, No. 4 of 2016 violations. 
 
(d) Section 4 of Lanka Hotel Corporation (Repeal) Act, stipulate that the employees  be assured of terms and 
conditions, which were not less favourable to be grante d. The terms and conditions, are emboded in a letter of 
appointment, issuance of which is laid down under sec tion 17 read with regulation 15 made under Shop and 
Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act. It is unclear as to why the applicants 
failed to submit the most essential document for verification by the court in this instance. 
 
7. Award  
 
I have analyzed comprehensively evidence and submissions placed before me, and I am convinced that applicants have 
failed to establish their case. As such applicants are not entitle to any relief. I certify that this award is just and equitable.
