Greetings!
Whereas the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received for the overall policy framework and proposals
set out in the Cabinet Memorandum presented by His Excellency the President on 27
th April 2021 to transform Sri Lanka into
a Green Socio-economy with Sustainable Solutions for Climate Changes,
And whereas, a popular verdict has been given in order to meet the challenges posed having regard to the matters
relating to the use of fertilizer, lands, biodiversity, atmosphere, waste, industries, renewable energy, settlements & towns and
environmental education that have been emphatically referred to in the policy statement: “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”.
Giving consideration to the fact that no relatively good quality production is secured in spite of the colossal amount
being currently expended nationally on chemical fertilizer, weedicides and pesticides and such matters as the pollution of
water due to its excessive use causing onset of diseases affecting health of the people resulting in their being deprived of
their means of livelihood and the difficulties being increasingly experienced by them in securing toxin-free foods.
Focusing on the need to retain within the country the foreign exchange being drawn away on importation of
chemical fertilizer, fuel, plastics, chemical substances and the benefits that could be derived nationally and internationally by
the launch of a programme for improving biodiversity in Sri Lanka and eco-friendly houses by utilization of organic and
natural fertilizer and the potential for sustainable development by minimizing climate changes and through a green economy,
