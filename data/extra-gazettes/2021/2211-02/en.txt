The	following	Definitions	apply	to	section	B and C above:-
“Common Gateway Switch” Common gateway is a telephone exchange which interconnects home PsTN network with 
other local PsTN networks. a common gateway switch does not directly connect subscribers, instead it connects with 
other switching exchanges. The calls between local PsTN networks are routed through the common gateway switches.
“International Gateway Switch”
International Gateway is a telephone exchange which interconnects a national P sTN network with one or more 
international gateway exchanges of international operators or foreign PsTN operators, thus providing a cross-border 
connectivity	for	voice	traffic.	The	calls	between	countries	are	routed	through	the	international	gateway	switches.
“Access Network”
an access network is a type of telecommunication network which connects subscribers to immediate PsTN operators. The 
access network can be either wired or wireless. The subscribers use access networks to connect with their operators, 
core networks in order to obtain the telecommunication services such as voice and data connectivity.
“Core Network”
Core network provides voice and data services to subscribers who are connected via access networks. It interconnects 
other local and foreign PsTN networks in order to provide cross operator and cross border services. The core network 
includes a series of physical entities to realize subscriber management, networking functions and service control.
