Case No.: A 2740           Vs . .................................
National Savings Bank,
No. 255, Galle Road,
Colombo 03.
Order on Preliminary Legal Objection
Appearances:
Mr. Ravi Molligoda Attorney-at-Law for the workmen and
Mr. Amaranath Fernando Attorney-at-Law of the Respondent
Bank with Mrs. K. Gunasekara, Legal Officer.
This is a case where the industrial dispute between the
parties was referred to me by he Commissioner of Labour
under section 3(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, chapter
131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised
Edition) as subsequently amended, for settlement by
arbitration. After  full inquiry an award was made by me on
12th November 2004, which was published in Gazette
Extraordinary on 05th January 2005. A writ application
against my award was filed in the Court of Appeal and the
writ application was dismissed on 28.05.2008. Application for
special leave to appeal was made to Supreme Court. Leave
was refused on 09th October 2008.
02. Thereafter the Commissioner of Labour by his letter
dated 12.05.2010 addressed to me, wanted my interpretation
of my award in case No. A-2740 under section 34(1) of the
Industrial Disputes Act,  No. 43 of 1950. The Commissioner
of Labour has not stated in specific terms the issues for
interpretaion. He has stated inter alia as follows:–

"As transpired in the investigations conducted by the
Asst. Commissioner of  Labour (Colombo East) there is
no positive compliance from the Respondent Bank with
regard to the settlement of arrears of salary of the
employees concerned. Hence they have sought further
intervention of this office."
03. As a follow up of the letter of 12.05.2010 from the
Commissioner of Labour, parties were noticed by me.
The Bank has raised the following preliminary legal
objections:
(I) Arbitration Tribunal is functus and lacks the
jurisdiction to hear this application,
(ii) The application for interpretation of the award of this
Tribunal is belated.
04. Written Submissions tendered by both parties were
exchanged. At this stage, in order to give  ruling I have the
compulsion to examine closely the law as it stands today, in
relation to interpretation of the award made by me as an
Arbitrator.
Reference for interpretation has been made to me under
section 34 of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950.
Section 34 provides for reference by the Commissioner of
Labour for interpretation to the Arbitrator who made the
award. Accordingly the Commissioner of Labour has referred
to me for arbitration. Section 34 also provides for decision to
be made by the Arbitrator after hearing the parties or without
such hearing if the consent of the parties has been first
obtained.
05. It is considered appropriate to quote section (15) of
the Industrial Disputes (Hearing and Determination of
Proceedigns) (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 2003 which
reads as follows:–
"A reference under section 34 of th Industrial Disputes
Act relating to the interpretation of any award or order
made by an arbitrator, labour tribunal or an Industrial
Court as the case may be, May be made within one
Month of the date of the making of such award or order,
and it shall be the duty of the arbitrator, labour tribunal
or the Industrial Court as the case may be, to which
such reference is being made, to hear and determine
such reference within one month of the date of receipt
of such reference."
This Act, No. 13 of 2003 was certified on 20th March 2003.
Section 01 of this Act states that it shall come into operation
on such date as the Minister may appoint by Order published
in the Gazette. The Minister by his order dated 14th May
2003 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1288/14
dated 14th May 2003 has appointed December 31st 2003, as
the date on which the Act shall come into operation.
It is also considered appropriate to quote below the
preamble to this Act which reads as follows:–
"Whereas it has become necessary to ensure an
expeditious disposal of applications and references
made under the Industrial Disputes Act and the
Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special
Provisions) Act, in order that parties to such
applications and references may be able to obtain
decisions in respect of the same within a short period
of time:
And whereas to facilitate such expeditious disposal it
is considered desirable to Stipulate time frames in
respect of the procedure adopted in the determination
of applications made to labour tribunals and the
Commissioner and references made to an arbitrator, and
in respect of the hearing and deciding of appeals lodged
against orders made on such applications:"
The preamble explains the reasons for imposing time frame.
I have examined the Labour Code of Sri Lanka consolidated
and updated up to 31st December 2009, which too does not
make any reference to Act, No. 13 of 2003. This is obviously
an error. The written submissions tendered to me do not make
any reference to Act, No. 13 of 2003.
06. Viewed in the light of the foregoing in law, in accordance
with the Industrial Disputes (Hearing and Determination of
Proceedings) (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 2003, quoted
above, this reference for interpretation done on 12.05.2010 in
relation to my award of 12th November 2004 (i.e. after a period
of more than five years from the date of the award) is clearly
prescribed in law.
07. In these circumstances the two preliminary legal
objections  raised by Bank must necessarily fail, as the only
preliminary legal objection appropriate in this instance is time
bar.
08. In view of my determination that the reference to
interpretation to me is time-barred, I am precluded from
proceeding further in this matter.
09. Accordingly the proceedings are terminated by me.

IMALARAJAH,
Arbitrator.
