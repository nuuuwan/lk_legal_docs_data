(read with the Industrial Disputes Special Provisions Act,
No. 37 of 1968) has appointed me as the Arbitrator to the
settle the following dispute by Arbitration.
The matters in dispute between the aforesaid parties is :
“Whether the non offer of employment from April 2005 by
the Accessory Corp (Pvt) Limited to the hundred and one
(101) employees whose names are referred to in the attached
schedule and non payment of wages to them as a result of
deviating from the existing terms of employment of the
Company is reasonable and lawful and if not, to what relief
each of them is entitled.”
Preliminary
The Party of the First Part (hereinafter called and referred
to as the Plaintiff) filed the preliminary statement on
24.11.2006 and the inquiry was conducted for 33 days and
written submissions were to be tendered on 04.08.2010.
The party of the Second Part did not file a preliminary
statement.
Proceedings
The Ceylon Mercantile Industrial and General Workers’
Union (CMU) (hereinafter called and referred to as the CMU)
filed their statement of the dispute between the CMU and the
Accessory Corp (Pvt) Limited under Regulation 21 of the
Industrial Disputes Act on 24.11.2006. In this statement they
stated that this dispute arose consequent to the non offer of
employment and the non payment of wages to the 101 workers
employed by the Company from April 2005.
They state that the Company sought to impose new
conditions of work on the workers by unilaterally reducing
the number of workers in anyone shut in the Moulding
Section.
The workers had protested at this new arrangement which
had been an idea of an American Advisor. The workers stated
that this arrangement was a physical impossibility to achieve
and would also lead to the workers being found redundant in
the future. As a consequence, the Company put out another
notice to the workers that the work in the Moulding Section
would cease after 5 p.m. on 05.04.2005 and the employees in
the Moulding Section were instructed not to report for work
from 06.04.2005.
The Company on 21.04.05 put up another notice.on the
Notice Board that if there were any workers of the Moulding
Section who did not wish to work according to the new
arrangements, they could leave the service of the Company
voluntarily and that they would be paid all benefits legally
due to them. The workers submitted individual letters to the
Company stating that they were not willing to work according
to the new arrangements but that they were prepared to work
under the previous arrangement.
On 12.05.05 the Company issued letters of vacation of
post to the workers.
The CMU Union had brought this matter to the notice of
the Commissioner of Labour and a formula was suggested to
resolve this problem on the basis that three workers be
engaged for 6 CV Moulding machines and 4 CV Moulding
machines instead of 4, and 2 workers for the T Hook Moulding
machines. The workers agreed to this formula but the
Company did not agree.
The CMU Union has suggested that the workers had been
locked out and that the unilateral arrangement of work was
illegal.
Summons in this case was originally issued to the
Accessory Corp (Pvt) Limited at the Ranala address but there
was no response. Subsequently the CMU had found that
letters to the Company had to be written to a American address
but several letters written to this American address was of no
avail.
When this case was called on 30.05.2007 the representative
appearing for the Union stated that the Accessory Corp (Pvt)
Limited had been purchsed by Korean “ Spa Industrial
Company (Pvt) Ltd by a Moderawila Industrial Zone Panadura.
On an order of Court the Registrar of the Industrial Court
wrote to this Company on 06.09.07 and that company replied
by letter dated 13.09.07 stating that Korean Spa Industrial Co.
(Pvt) Limited is not the successor to the Accessory Corp (Pvt)
Ltd. of Nawagamuwa, Ranala and that they have no connection
at all with the said company.
When this case was called on 27.09.07 the Union submitted
that there had been a notice in the Silumina Sinhala newspaper
of 23.09.07 calling for vacancies for workers to make Plastic
Hangars and the name of that Company was Korean Spa
Accessories Co. (Pvt) Ltd. of Sri Sumanatissa Mawatha,
Nawagamuwa, Ranala. The Union submitted that this must
be the successor to the Accessories Corp (Pvt) Ltd. also of
Sri Sumantissa Mawatha, Nawagamuwa, Ranala. On the plea
of the Union, Court ordered the Registrar to issue summons
on this new company.
When the case was called on 14.11.07 the Korean Spa
Accessories (Pvt) Ltd was represented by Attorney-at-Law
Pradeep Fernando who said that there had been a problem
with the workers of Accessory Corp. (Pvt) Ltd and that the

<!-- page 4 -->

4A I fldgi: (I) fPoh - Y%S ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2011'02'01
buildings had been mortgaged to the Commercial Bank PLC.
He said that the Korean Spa Accessories (Pvt) Ltd had begun
the management of the Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd according
to the details submitted to him.
When this case was called again on 12.12.07 the Attorney-
at-Law Pradeep Fernando stated that his company did,not
have any details of the dispute between the workers and that
Company and therefore he requested for more time to given
further details to Court.
When the case was called on 04.06.08, the Attorney-at-
Law for the Korean Spa Accessories (Pvt) Ltd presented to
Court a copy of a Transfer Deed No, 1472 dated 29.05.2007
attested by L.H. Ganiath Notary Public of Colombo showing
the transfer of the property of Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd, to
the Korean Spa  Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd and a special Power
of Attorney executed by the then directors of the Company
in favour of Mr. Paul Issac Franco to sign the transfer deed
and to attend to matters concerning the transfer of the
Company.
When Court examined these documents it was seen that
the special Power of Attorney did not contain any attestation
by an Attorney-at-Law in Sri Lanka on page 2 of this
documents. It appeared that this document had been prepared
in the USA but it had not been stamped and duly attested by
an Attorney in the USA Court also told the Counsel for Korean
Spa Accessory (Pvt) Ltd that the transfer deed submitted to
Court cannot be accepted since it appears incomplete and
does not reflect the liabilities that are incurred in this respect.
Court therefore requested the representative legal officer
of the Commercial bank PLC to produce to Court the original
of the Mortgage Bond entered into with the Accessory Corp
(Pvt) Ltd and to show Court the share or items transferred or
mortgaged.
When the case was called on 31.07.08 the Mortgage Bond
No. 1599 dated 28.06.02 was examined and it showed that all
the buildings of Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd had been
mortgaged for the sum of US$3,60,000 and later redeemed by
the Korean Spa Accessory (Pvt) Ltd. Court therefore directed
the Korean Spa Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd to submit an
agreement, if any, that was arrived at between the Accessory
Corp (Pvt) Ltd and the Korean Spa Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd
showing the transfer of assets and liabilities.
The Korean Spa Accessory (Pvt) Ltd also submitted to
Court the deed No.506 dated 12.07.07 of the Board of
Investment of Sri Lanka approving the purchase of the land
and buildings of Accessory Network (Pvt) Ltd and the grant
of approval to begin the enterprise for the manufacture of
plastic hangars for export on an investment of US$ 2,000,000.
AWARD
 It is clear that the 101 employees of the Accessory Corp
(Pvt) Ltd had perused to work under the new arrangements
proposed by the American advisor to the company on the
basis that it would lead to the gutting down of the number of
employees.
It is also clear that when this dispute arose the Company
closed down and the employees were told that they had
vacated their posts. This position is not tenable since vacation
of post of an employee rests on two factors the mental aspect
and the physical aspect. These employees were not mentally
tuned towards not going back to work. They were employees
who said that they were prepared to work under the old
arrangement. In fact, when the Commissioner of Labour
suggested a settlement they agreed to resume work but the
Company refused to agree to that settlement. Therefore, there
had been no vacation of posts of these employees.
The primary question was whether the Korean Spa
Accessory (Pvt) Ltd had an agreement regarding these
employees of Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd. The Legal Officer
representing Korean Spa Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd, presented
the Mortgage bond of the Commercial Bank which showed
that this bond had been discharged by Korean Spa Accessory
Corp (Pvt) Ltd. Court was not shown any agreement the two
companies would have had regarding the discharge of the
liabilities of the Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd.
This position is not tenable since any agreement of the
nature arrived at between these two companies should have
contained provisions for the settlement of disputes that had
risen when the transfer of assets was effected in favour of
Korean Spa Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd.
Also the Korean Spa Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd had begun
the business of the previous company and it can be
reasonably assumed that the transfer of assets of Accessory
Corp meant not only the transfer of the buildings but also the
machinery and equipment for which they wanted workmen
hence their advertisement in the Sinhala newspaper calling
for workmen for the manufacture of plastic hangers. It is a
maxim of law that a management cannot by merely transferring
their asset get rid of the claims and rights of their workmen.
It is clear therefore that the new company Korean Spa
Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd had taken over the business and
the assets and liabilities of the previous Company Accessory
Corp (Pvt) Ltd and therefore becomes liable in law to meet the

5AI fldgi: (I) fPoh - Y%S ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h -  2011'02'01
liabilities of these employees. I do not accept the position
that these employees had vacated their posts. They were
merely demanding that they be allowed to work in the existing
positions.
A
W ARD
According I hold that the non employment of these
employees from April 2003 and the non payment of salaries
to them is an unreasonable and unlawful deviation from their
existing terms of employment.
I therefore state that each of the 101 employees should
receive the salaries that they received while in employment in
April 2005 for the period from April 2005 up to the date of this
award and the responsibility for payment rests completely
with Korean Spa Accessory Corp (Pvt) Ltd of Sri Sumantissa
Mawatha, Nawagamuwa, Ranala.
I also award to each of these 101 employees a
compensation package of the equivalent of 3 months gross
salary that they received while in employment per year for
the period from April 2005 up to the date of this award.
These payments should be made through the
Commissioner of Labour, Colombo North to the 101 employees
within one month of the publication of this award in the
Government Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Government
of Sri Lanka.
