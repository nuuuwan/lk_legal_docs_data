2. The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is:—
(1) "whether any unjust was caused to Mr. A.S.B.
Dissanayake who was employed on temporary basis
at the Hettipola Paddy Purchasing Center of the Co-
operative wholesale Establishment from 04.03.1999
upto 23.02.2000 due to imposition of surcharge without
holding an inquiry against him regarding a shortage in
the stock occurred in the said center and if any unjust
was caused, to what relief he is entitled,
(2) whether the amount of compensation had been
computed in a reasonable and justifiable manner for
payment to Mr. A.S.B. Dissanayake who served in the
Co-operative Wholesale Establishment from 02.04.1984
upto 31.03.2004 and left the service of the establishment
under the Voluntary Compensation Scheme and if any
unjust was caused, what should be the accurate amount
of compensation payable to him? and
(3) whether any unjust was caused to him A.S.B.
Dissanayake owing to non payment of the amount of
compensation as yet by the Co-operative Wholesale
Establishment and if any unjust was caused to him, to
what relief he is entitled?"
3. The applicant workman was represented by Mr. K.A.
Shelton, while the Respondent Employer was represented by
Mr. Chandra Gunatilleke and Ms. Nilusha Gunatilleke,
Attorneys-at-Law.
Applicant marked 7 documents (me 1  to  me 7) Respondent's
witnesses, namely Mr. W.J.C. Fernando and Mr. Merryl
Fernando marked documents (Rl to R7)
Applicant stated that he joined the Co-operative Wholesale
Establishment on 02nd April 1984 and worked continuously.
In terms of the circular bearing No. 2004/2 of 12.02.2004 issued
by the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, a V oluntary
Retirement Scheme was proposed to the employees, with the
concurrence of the Secretary to the Treasury Inter alia circular
stipulated a payment of 2 months for every year of past service
and 2 1/2 months for every year of future service by way of
compensation and it is effective from 31.03.2004.
Applicant's salary at the time was Rs. l0,765/= and only
two more years to serve and when computed he was to receive
a total sum of Rs.457,000 by way of compensation. Combining
receipt of Employees Provident Fund benefits, Pension Fund
dues and Gratuity, he envisaged receipt of a substantial sum
of money so that he would invest on a profitable venture.
There upon he decided to apply for the V oluntary Retirement
Scheme, and the Management accepted the application
promptly. When he called over to collect the cheque, on
request, Management handed over a letter, which stated that,
he had to pay a sum of Rs.168,428 being the value of shortages
detected at a verification, consequent to services at a Paddy
Purchasing Centre at Hettipola, during the period of 1999/2000.
He promptly rejected the accusation, on the ground that
he relinquished the duties of Store Keeper, as far back as
February, 2000 and had a clean record throughout the career
and it was a surprise to hear of a surcharge made on account
of any shortage. He also recalled that in July, 2003 an
Investigation office had indicated of a shortage and he replied
on 27.07.2003, requesting to peruse the records, and thereafter
nobody questioned.
He was not interdicted, nor summoned for any inquiry but
having accepted the application lodged for compensation,
management arbitrarily refused payment of the compensation
rightly claimed. He further stated the management
comprehensively failed and neglected to follow the
Disciplinary Code, applicable to employees in the Co-operative
Wholesale Establishment, in situations where issues of
misconduct surfaced on account of shortages detected.
W.T.C. Fernando, the Respondent's witness stated that he
served the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment and retired
in terms of the V oluntary Retirement Scheme with effect from
31.03.2004. At the time of leaving, he served as the Chief
Accounts Clerk of Stock V erification Unit. He gave a detailed
account of the processes in dealing with the verification of
Stores, Excesses and Shortage situations, imposition of
surcharges. appeal procedure etc. However, with regard to
the applicant's matter in issue, no documents were produced
or marked, which indicated the details of investigations done,
quantities, volume and other relevant facts, to ascertain the
veracity of the charge. He stated that he is not in a position to
produce the relevant documents, since he is not in employment
at present.
Mr. M. M. Fernando, was the Respondent's next witness,
who stated that he served the Organization as the Head of the
Finance Division and during the years 2003/4 he served at
the Stock Verification Division as an Investigating officer
attached to the Investigating Unit, and at the same time as the
Secretary of Appeal Board. The witness gave an elaborate
account of the process involved and which were carried out
by the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, when the
shortages occured. He also explained how ad -hoc for Paddy
purchasing Centres were established, staff recruitment
procedure, their supervision, verification and follow up on
shortage detection including the recovery procedure. The

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 10.02.2011
witness however failed to produce before Court any of the
relevant documents concerning shortage detection,
particularly at this instance and even the annexure to the
application made by the applicant to his employer. The replies
made regarding the questions raised were evasive and not on
firm ground.
In conclusion of oral evidence, both parties made written
submissions enclosing the marked documents.
4. My findings are as follows:-
( A) Under Article 170 of the Constitution of Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka" a public corporation has been
defined to mean,
"any corporation board or other body which was or is
established by or under any written law, other than
the Companies Ordinance, with capital wholly, or
partly provided by the Government by way of grant,
loan or otherwise. "
The State establishing a public corporation makes it a legal
entity with perpetual succession and a common seal and with
capacity to sue and be sued in its corporate name.
The Co-operative Wholesale Establishment came into
existence per Act, No.47 of 1949, (amended from time to time)
on the similar lines.
(B) Chairman, Co-operative Establishment, by his circular
letter No. AB/2004/02 dated 12
th February, 2004 addressed to
all employees proposed a V oluntary Retirement Scheme (2004)
in agreement with the Secretary to the Treasury, on the basis
of his communique bearing Nos. PED 10 of 28.05.2003 and
PED 10 of 21.07.2003 emanating from the Department of Public
Enterprises titled "Compensation Package for Employees of
Public Enterprises who opt for V oluntary Retirement Scheme
(VRS)".
Chairman instructed that applications should be furnished
on or before 27
th February, 2004.
In terms of this Circular Letter, the applicant A.S.B
Dissnayake applied opting retirement. His date of birth being
9th January, 1951 as at 31
st March, 2004 he reaches the age of
53+ years. He could serve nearly 2 years more if retirement age
was fixed at 55.
His application opting the retirement, under VRS (2004)
Scheme was accepted by the Management, released the
Employees Provident Fund and Employees Trust Fund
benefits, as well as gratuity payable under the Payment of
Gratuity Act.
However, when he called over to collect the cheque due to
him under the VR Scheme, it was withheld.
Instead, Management handed over a copy of a letter (me 3)
to the applicant. The letter signed by a Senior Manager in-
charge of disciplinary matters which had been addressed to
the Senior Accountant (Salaries) stated briefly that the
following amount be recovered :-
Stores -   Hettipola
Period -   04.03.1999 to 23.02.2000
Shortage -   Rs. 811,559.05
Surcharge -   Rs. 409,350.42
Amended Surcharge -   Rs. 168,428,00
The amended surcharge dated 11.03.2004, comes after 48
months, barely 3 weeks prior to the date of retirement. He
rejected the allegation.
(C) With regard to the core issue it was observed that -
(i) the applicant/workman relinquished duties as the
Storekeeper, Hettipola on 23.02.2000, but was informed
of a shortage after 39 months, i.e. on 26.05.2003 to
which he replied on 15.06.2003. A follow up letter from
the Respondent dated 30.06,2003 received by the
applicant was replied on 27.07.2003, vide ( me 4).
Applicant in both his replies rejected the allegation
and sought careful scrutiny.
(ii) It is unclear why the respondent was silent for 39
months.
(iii) Respondent rely heavily on ( me 4), but there is no
evidence whatsoever, as to whether a formal or
informal inquiry involving the applicant, to ascertain
the veracity of the allegation, was infact held.
Respondent is in breach of the principles of the natural
justice.
(iv) There is no evidence oral or documentary to establish
that a stock verification was carried out. During the
period the applicant was in charge, no such stock
verification had been done.
(v) Respondent failed to establish that a Stock Verification
concerning the Hettipola Paddy Purchasing Centre
was done at all -
* at any time, no dates were furnished,
* verification was caused by whom, names of
investigators were not furnished and none of them
gave oral evidence.
* If a verification had been done, the varieties,
quantities, and value of items, which are subject
to verification has not been furnished.

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRA TIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 10.02.2011
* Had a verification done, and a shortage surfaced,
there from promptly the applicant should have
been summoned, and a show cause letter issued
and evaluated its worth.
The Court is entitled to examine, such evidence, oral as
well as documentary. With so many senior executives
monitoring the activities of marketing, finance, administration,
etc., it is unclear why the respondent organization failed to act
promptly in these matters, where losses are involved. There is
not an iota of evidence, to establish that the applicant was
responsible. This seems to be an extreme form of unfair labour
practice.
(D)  To highlight statements embodied in the said circular
letter offering the V oluntary Retirement Scheme to all CWE
employees, the Chairman states —
(E) Under the subheading - Application Procedure (last
sentence)
"However , the management has the right to reject any
application or postpone the date of release of any
applicant on the exigencies of the service".
Based on the above, if the applicant was in fact suspected
of any connection concerning an offence, the management
having accepted the offer of V oluntary Retirement Scheme,
could have still kept him in employment or interdicted as per
(e) above pending conclusion of the matter of shortages.
The applicant had served the organization for 20 years and
had an unblemished record of service.
Besides, V oluntary Retirement Scheme came into operation
with the concurrence of the Treasury since the respondent
Organization faced financial problems. The Scheme intends
to consider the employable period and past service, and award
a terminal benefit,  which the applicant rightly accepted on
offer.
5.  In conclusion, I find that the decision of the management
in relation to the  allegation against the applicant will not
prevail, —
- as there is want of bona fides,
- it is a case of victimization or unfair labour practice in
violation of the principles of natural justice,
- there is a basic error on facts, and
- there has been a perverse finding on the materials.
Having examined the evidence comprehensively, I award
that the applicant workman be paid the following amounts:-
(a) In terms of the V oluntary Retirement Scheme, on account
of the past services, 2 months wages for each year of
service - (19 years, 11 months and 29 days, i.e. one day
short for one complete year) Approx; 20 years.
(b) Considering the Management's callous irresponsibility
coupled with the failure to recall or retain the workman
in service, the wages denied works out to - (1 year and
9 months, i.e. 21 months). However, only 50% of the
total wage due is computed for purpose of wages denied,
which works out to 10 1/2 months. This is in lieu of VRS
proposed for employable period.
Workman's last drawn salary being Rs.10,765.00 per month,
in respect of 50 1/2 months (40 months wages for 20 years
past service and 10 1/2 months wages for employable period)
wages works out to Rs.543,612.50 (Rs. Five Hundred, Forty
Three Thousand, Six Hundred and Twelve and Cents Fifty
only).
The amount shall be deposited with the Asst. Commissioner
of Labour, Colombo South District Labour Office, Labour
Secretariat, Colombo 05. within 45 days of the publication of
this Award in the Govt. Gazette.
This is a just and a fair award.
