office with the change of the Government or continued to hold such office after such change, have made allegations that
they have been subject to political victimization during the period commencing 08 th January 2015 and ending   16 th
November 2019;
AND WHEREAS, it has also been reported that several persons including public officers who have held or
continue to hold office in the institutions that are alleged to have been manipulated in furtherance of the alleged political
victimization have publicly expressed that such process of political victimization was instigated through a special unit
dealing with Anti Corruption, operating under the purview of the Prime Minister during the aforesaid period of alleged
political victimization;
AND WHEREAS, it has been alleged that the said Anti-Corruption unit first decided on who should be investigated
and thereafter referred complaints to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption(CIABOC),
Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police and/or the Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of
the Sri Lanka Police, during the aforesaid period;
AND WHEREAS, it also been alleged that several complaints lodged by the public before the Commission to
Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka
Police and/or the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police have gone unheeded;
AND WHEREAS, it has been brought to my notice that the alleged process of political victimization has created
a substantial negative impact on the performance of public officers, employees of public corporations and members of
the armed forces and police service, and, as a result, such officers, employees and members have shown and show reluctance
to take decisions while discharging their duties and prefer to adopt a passive approach towards work, thereby causing a
prejudicial impact on the functions of Government;
AND WHEREAS, it appears to me, therefore, to be necessary that an inquiry should be held and information
obtained as to the matters hereinafter referred to in this warrant, being matters relating to the administration of public
bodies, the administration or law and/or justice, the conduct of public officers, including the identification of any person,
persons or entities, if any, who have been involved in or are responsible for the alleged political victimization, and/or
matters in respect of which an inquiry would, in my opinion, be in the public interest;
AND WHEREAS, any findings, report and recommendations arising out of such an inquiry would be material to
and facilitate the taking of preventive and remedial measures;
AND WHEREAS, noting that the scope of the inquiry into the said matter under this warrant would not in any way
impose a fetter upon the relevant authorities exercising their statutory and legal responsibilities and also taking note that
the relevant authorities are empowered in terms of the applicable written laws to consider and, where possible, pursue
available action, in terms of the applicable written laws, notwithstanding the inquiry conducted in terms of this warrant;
AND WHEREAS, noting that the inquiry under this warrant is, therefore, in addition to and without prejudice to
any measures that have been taken or which may be taken by relevant authorities including the Sri Lanka Police, the
Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) and the Attorney General;
Now therefore, I Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka reposing
great trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity, do, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 of the
Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393) as amended, by these presents appoint you, the said;
1. Hon. Upaly Abeyrathne Esquire
Retired Judge of the Supreme Court
2. Hon. Daya Chandrasiri Jayathilaka Esquire
