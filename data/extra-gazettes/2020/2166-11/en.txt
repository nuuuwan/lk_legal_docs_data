Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 
Included separately at the end of this document. 
SLFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRSs) 
D1  An entity may elect to use one or more of the following exemptions: 
…………… 
 (o) transfers of assets from customers (paragraph D24) [deleted];

SLFRS 2 - Share-based Payment 
63E [This paragraph refers to amendments that are not yet effective, and is therefore not 
included in this edition.]  
Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in SLFRS Standards, issued 
in 2018, amended the footnote to the definition of an equity instrument in Appendix A. An 
entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. 
Earlier application is permitted if at the same time an entity also applies all other 
amendments made by Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in 
SLFRSs. An entity shall apply the amendment to SLFRS 2 retrospectively, subject to the 
transitional provisions in paragraphs 53–59 of this Standard, in accordance with LKAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. However, if an entity 
determines that retrospective application would be impracticable or would involve  undue

cost or effort, it shall apply the amendment to SLFRS 2 by reference to paragraphs 23–28, 
50–53 and 54F of LKAS 8. 
Appendix A equity instrument  
A contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of 
its liabilities4. 
4. The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting  issued in 2018 defines a liability as a present obligation 
of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity 
of resources embodying economic benefits (ie an outflow of cash or other assets of the entity) to transfer an 
economic resource as a result of past events. 
SLFRS 3 Business Combinations 
3 An entity shall determine whether a transaction or other event is a  business 
combination by applying the definition in this SLFRS, which requires that the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a  business. If the assets acquired are not 
a business, the reporting entity shall account for the transaction or other event as an 
asset acquisition.  Paragraphs B5 –B12B12D provide guidance on identifying a 
business combination and the definition of a business. 
64P Definition of a Business, issued in January 2019 , added  paragraphs B7A –
B7C, B8A and B12A–B12D, amended the definition of the term ‘business’ in Appendix 
A, amended paragraphs 3, B7 –B9, B11 and  B12 and deleted paragraph B10. An entity 
shall apply these amendments to  business combinations for which the  acquisition date is 
on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 
2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period. Earlier 
application of these amendm ents is permitted. If an entity applies these amendments for 
an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact. 
Appendix A business 
An integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed 
for the purpose of providing a retur n in the form of dividends, lower costs or other 
economic benefits directly to investors or other owners, members or participants. goods or 
services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or 
generating other income from ordinary activities. 
B7  A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to 
create contribute to the creation of  outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, 
outputs are not required for an integrated set to  qualify as a business. The three elements 
of a business are defined as follows : (see paragraphs B8 –B12D for guidance on the 
elements of a business): 
(a) Input:  Any economic resource that creates outputs, or has the ability to create 
contribute to the cre ation of outputs when one or more processes are applied to it. 
Examples include non ‑current assets (including intangible assets or rights to use 
non‑current assets), intellectual property, the ability to obtain access to necessary 
materials or rights and employees. 
(b) Process:  Any system, standard, protocol, convention or rule that when applied to an

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
input or inputs, creates outputs or has the ability to create contribute to the creation of 
outputs. Examples include strategic management processes, operati onal processes 
and resource management processes. These processes typically are documented, but 
the intellectual capacity of  an organised workforce having the necessary skills and 
experience following rules and conventions may provide the necessary processes that 
are capable of being applied to inputs to create outputs. (Accounting, billing, payroll 
and other administrative systems typically are not processes used to create outputs.) 
(c) Output:  The result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods 
or have the ability services to provide a return in the form of dividends, lower costs 
customers, generate investment income (such as  dividends, or interest) or generate  
other economic benefits directly income from ordinary activities to investors or other 
owners, members or participants. 
 
B7A 
Optional test to identify concentration of fair value 
Paragraph B7B sets out an optional test (the concentration test) to permit a simplified 
assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a  business. An entity 
may elect to apply, or not apply, the test. An entity may make such an election separately 
for each transaction or other event. The concentration test has the following consequences: 
(a) if the concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be 
a business and no further assessment is needed. 
(b) if the concentration test is not met, or if the entity elects not to apply the test, the entity 
shall then perform the assessment set out in paragraphs B8–B12D. 
B7B The concentration test is met if substantially all of the  fair value  of the gross assets 
acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. 
For the concentration test: 
(a) gross assets acquired shall exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, 
and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities.  
(b) the fair value of the gross assets acquired shall include any consideration transferred 
(plus the fair value of any  non‑controlling interest  and the fair value of any 
previously held interest) in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. 
The fair value of the gross assets acquired  may normally be determined as the total 
obtained by adding the fair value of the consideration transferred (plus the fair value 
of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest) to 
the fair value of the liabilities assume d (other than deferred tax liabilities), and then 
excluding the items identified in subparagraph (a). However, if the fair value of the 
gross assets acquired is more than that total, a more precise calculation may 
sometimes be needed. 
(c) a single identifi able asset shall include any asset or group of assets that would be 
recognised and measured as a single identifiable asset in a business combination.

(d) if a tangible asset is attached to, and cannot be physically removed and used separately 
from, another tangible asset (or from an underlying asset subject to a lease, as defined 
in SLFRS 16 Leases), without incurring significant cost, or significant diminution in 
utility or fair value to either asset (for example, land and buildings), those assets shall 
be considered a single identifiable asset. 
(e) when assessing whether assets are similar, an entity shall consider the nature of each 
single identifiable asset and the risks associated with managing and creating outputs 
from the assets (that is, the risk characteristics).  
(f) the following shall not be considered similar assets: 
(i) a tangible asset and an intangible asset;  
(ii) tangible assets in different classes (for example, inventory, manufacturing 
equipment and automobiles) unless they are cons idered a single identifiable 
asset in accordance with the criterion in subparagraph (d);  
(iii) identifiable intangible assets in different classes (for example, brand names, 
licences and intangible assets under development);  
(iv) a financial asset and a non-financial asset; 
(v) financial assets in different classes (for example, accounts receivable and 
investments in equity instruments); and 
(vi) identifiable assets that are within the same class of asset but have significantly 
different risk characteristics.  
B7C The requirements in paragraph B7B do not modify the guidance on similar assets in LKAS 
38 Intangible Assets; nor do they modify the meaning of the term ‘class’ in LKAS 16 
Property, Plant and Equipment , LKAS 38 and SLFRS 7 Financial Instruments:

B8 
Elements of a business 
Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of 
activities and assets to qualify as a business.  To be capable of being conducted and 
managed for the purpose defined identified in the definition of a business , an integrated 
set of activities and assets requires two essential elements —inputs and processes applied 
to those inputs , which together are or will be used to create outputs. However, a.  
A business need not include all of the inputs or processes that the seller used in operating 
that business . if market participants are capable .  if market participants are capable  
However, to be considered a business, an integrated set of acquiring the business acquiring 
the business activities and continuing to produce outputs, for example, by integrating the 
business with their own inputs continuing to produce outputs, for example, by integrating 
the business with their own inputs  assets must include, at a minimum, an input  and 
processes a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020 
output. Paragraphs B12–B12D specify how to assess whether a process is substantive. 
B8A If an acquired set of activities and assets has outputs, continuation of revenue does not on 
its own indicate that both an input and a substantive process have been acquired. 
B9 The nature of the elements of a business varies by industry and by the structure of an 
entity’s operations (activities), including the entity’s sta ge of development. Established 
businesses often have many different types of inputs, processes and outputs, whereas new 
businesses often have few inputs and processes and sometimes only a single output 
(product). Nearly all businesses also have liabilities , but a business need not have 
liabilities. Furthermore, an acquired set of activities and assets that is not a business might 
have liabilities. 
B10 An integrated set of activities and assets in the development stage might not have outputs. 
If not, the acquirer should consider other factors to determine whether the set is a business. 
Those factors include, but are not limited to, whether the set: 
(a) has begun planned principal activities;
(b) has employees, intellectual property and other inputs and processes that could be
applied to those inputs; 
(c) is pursuing a plan to produce outputs; and
(d) will be able to obtain access to customers that will purchase the outputs.
Not all of those factors need to be present for a particular integrated set of activities and 
assets in the development stage to qualify as a business. 
[Deleted] 
B11 Determining whether a particular set of assets and activities and assets is a  business should 
shall be based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as 
a business by a market participant. Thus, in evaluating whether a particular set is a 
business, it is not relevant whether a seller operated the set as a busin ess or whether 
the acquirer intends to operate the set as a business. 
B12 
Determining Assessing whether a particular an acquired process is substantive 
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a particular set of assets and activities in which 
goodwill is present shall be presumed to be a business. However, a business need not have 
goodwill. Paragraphs B12A–B12D explain how to assess whether an acquired process is 
substantive if the acquired set of activities and assets does not have outputs (pa ragraph 
B12B) and if it does have outputs (paragraph B12C). 
B12A An example of an acquired set of activities and assets that does not have outputs at the 
acquisition date is an early-stage entity that has not started generating revenue. Moreover, 
if an acquired set of activities and assets was generating revenue at the acquisition date, it

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
is considered to have outputs at that date, even if subsequently it will no longer generate 
revenue from external customers, for example because it will be integrated by the acquirer.  
B12B If a set of activities and assets does not h ave outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired 
process (or group of processes) shall be considered substantive only if: 
(a) it is critical to the ability to develop or convert an acquired input or inputs into outputs; 
and 
(b) the inputs acquired include both an organised workforce that has the necessary skills, 
knowledge, or experience to perform that process (or group of processes) and other 
inputs that the organised workforce could develop or convert into outputs. Those other 
inputs could include: 
(i) intellectual property that could be used to develop a good or service; 
(ii) other economic resources that could be developed to create outputs; or 
(iii) rights to obtain access to necessary materials or rights that enable the creation 
of future outputs. 
Examples of the inputs mentioned  in subparagraphs (b)(i)–(iii) include technology, in -
process research and development projects, real estate and mineral interests. 
B12C If a set of activities and assets has outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or 
group of processes) shall be considered substantive if, when applied to an acquired input 
or inputs, it: 
(a) is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include 
an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform 
that process (or group of processes); or 
(b) significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and: 
(i) is considered unique or scarce; or 
(ii) cannot be replaced without significant cost, effor t, or delay in the ability to 
continue producing outputs. 
B12D The following additional discussion supports both paragraphs B12B and B12C: 
(a) an acquired contract is an input and not a substantive process. Nevertheless, an 
acquired contract, for example,  a contract for outsourced property management or 
outsourced asset management, may give access to an organised workforce. An entity 
shall assess whether an organised workforce accessed through such a contract 
performs a substantive process that the entity controls, and thus has acquired. Factors 
to be considered in making that assessment include the duration of the contract and 
its renewal terms. 
b) difficulties in replacing an acquired organised workforce may indicate that the 
acquired organised workforce performs a process that is critical to the ability to create

(c) a process (or group of processes) is not critical if, for example, it is ancillary or minor 
within the context of all the processes required to create outputs.

Material  Omissions or misstatements of items are : 
Information is material if they could, individually or collectively, omitting, misstating 
or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions that 
the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of the 
financial statements.  those financial statements, which provide financial information 
about a specific reporting entity. 
Materiality depends on the size and nature of the omission or misstatement judged in 
the surrounding nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether 
information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in 
the context of its financial statements taken as a whole. 
Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for 
primary users of financial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The

following are examples of  circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a 
combination of both, could be  that may result in material information being obscured: 
(a) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the 
financial statements but the language used is vague or unclear; 
(b) information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is scattered 
throughout the financial statements; 
(c) dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated; 
(d) similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and 
(e) the determining factor understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a 
result of material information being hidden by immaterial information to the extent 
that a primary user is unable to determine what information is material. 
Assessing whether an omission or misstatement information could reasonably be expected 
to influence economic decisions of users, and so be material, made by the primary users of 
a specific reporting entity’s general purpose financial statements requires consideration of 
an entity to consider the characteristics of those users. The Framework for the Preparation 
while also considering the entity’s own circumstances. 
Many existing and potential investors, lenders  and Presentation of other creditors cannot 
require reporting entities to provide information directly to them and must rely on general 
purpose financial statements for much of the financial information they need. 
Consequently, they are the primary users to who m general purpose financial statements 
are directed. Financial Statements states in paragraph 25  that ‘users are assumed to  
statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and 
economic activities and accounting who review and a willingness to study  analyse the 
information with reasonable diligence.’ Therefore,  diligently. At times, even well -
informed and diligent users may need to seek the assessment need said of an adviser to 
take into account how users with such attributes co uld reasonably be expected to be 
influenced in making  understand information about complex economic decisions 
phenomena. 
15 Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentat ion requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out 
in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework). The 
application of SLFRSs, with additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to 
result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. 
19 In the extremely rare circumstances in which management concludes that compliance 
with a requirement in a SLFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with 
the objective of financial statements set out in the Conceptual Framework, the entity 
shall depart from that requirement in the manner set out in   paragraph 20  if the

(c) the title of the SLFRS from which the entity has departed, the nature of the
departure, including the treatment that the SLFRS would require, the reason why
that treatment would be so misleading in the circumstances that it would conflict
with the objective of financial stateme nts set out in the  Conceptual Framework,
and the treatment adopted; and
……… 
23 In the extremely rare circumstances in which management concludes that compliance 
with a requirement in a SLFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the 
objective of financial statements set out in the  Conceptual Framework, but the 
relevant regulatory framework prohibits departure from the requirement, the entity 
shall, to the maximum extent possible, reduce the perceived misleading aspects of 
compliance by disclosing: 
(a) the title of the SLFRS in question, the nature of the requirement, and the reason
why management has concluded that complying with that requirement is so
misleading in the circumstances that it conflicts with the objective of financial
statements set out in the Conceptual Framework; and
……… 
24 For the purpose of paragraphs 19 –23, an item of information would conflict with the 
objective of financial statements when it does not represent faithfully the transactions, 
other events and conditions that it either purports to represent  or could reasonably be 
expected to represent and, consequently, it would be likely to influence economic decisions 
made by users of financial statements. When assessing whether complying with a specific 
requirement in a SLFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective 
of financial statements set out in the Conceptual Framework, management considers: 
(a) why the objective of financial statements is not achieved in the particular
circumstances; and
(b) how the entity’s circumstances differ from those of other entities that comply with the
requirement. If other entities in similar circumstances comply with the requirement,
there is a rebuttable presumption that the entity’s compliance with the requirement
would not be so misleading tha t it would conflict with the objective of financial
statements set out in the Conceptual Framework.
28 When the accrual basis of accounting is used, an entity recognises items as assets, 
liabilities, equity, income and expenses (the elements of financial statements) when they 
satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria for those elements in the  Conceptual 
Framework. 
89 Some SLFRSs specify circumstances when an entity recognises particular items 
outside  profit or loss  in the current period.  LKAS  8  specifies two such circumstances:

5  Material Omissions or misstatements of items are material if they could, individually or 
collectively, influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial 
statements. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the omission or misstatement 
judged in the surrounding circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a combination 
of both, could be the determining factor. 
Material is defined in paragraph 7 of LKAS 1 and is used in this Standard with the 
same meaning.

6 Assessing whether an omission or misstatement could influence economic decisions of 
users, and so be material, requires consideration of the characteristics of those users. The 
Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements states in 
paragraph 252 that ‘users are assumed to have a reasonable knowledge of business and 
economic activities an d accounting and a willingness to study the information with 
reasonable diligence.’ Therefore, the assessment needs to take into account how users with 
such attributes could reasonably be expected to be influenced in making economic 
decisions.

periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Earlier application is permitted if at the same 
time an entity also appli es all other amendments made by Amendments to References to 
the Conceptual Framework in SLFRSs. An entity shall apply the amendments to 
paragraphs 6 and 11(b) retrospectively in accordance  with this Standard. However, if an 
entity determines that retrospective application would be impracticable or would involve 
undue cost or effort, it shall apply the amendments to paragraphs 6 and 11(b) by reference 
to paragraphs 23 –28 of this Standard. If retrospective application of any amendment in 
Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in SLFRSs would involve undue 
cost or effort, an entity shall, in applying paragraphs 23 –28 of this Standard, read any 
reference except in the last sentence of paragraph 27 to ‘is impracticable’ as ‘involves 
undue cost or effort’ and any reference to ‘practicable’ as ‘possible without undue cost or 
effort’. 
54G If an entity does not apply  SLFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts , the entity shall, in 
applying paragraph 11(b) to regulatory account balances, continue to refer to, and consider 
the applicability of, the definitions, recognition criteria, and measurement concepts in 
the  Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements1 instead of 
those in the  Conceptual Framework. A regulatory account balanc e is the balance of any 
expense (or income) account that is not recognised as an asset or a liability in accordance 
with other applicable SLFRSs but is included, or is expected to be included, by the rate

financial information about a specific reporting entity . Accordingly, an entity shall 
disclose the following for each material category of non ‑adjusting event after the 
reporting period:  
(a) the nature of the event; and 
(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be 
made.

LKAS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
42 Because goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of the net investment in an 
associate or a joint venture is not separately recognised, it is not tested for impairment 
separately by applying the requirements for impairment testing goodwill in LKAS  36 
Impairment of Assets. Instead, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for  
impairment in accordance with LKAS  36 as a single asset, by comparing its recoverable 
amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell of disposal) with its carrying 
amount whenever application of paragraphs 41A –41C indicates that the net investment 
may be impaired. An impairment loss recognised in those circumstances is not allocated 
to any asset, including goodwill that  forms part of the carrying amount of the net 
investment in the associate or joint venture. Accordingly, any reversal of that impairment 
loss is recognised in accordance with LKAS  36 to the extent that the recoverable amount 
of the net investment subsequently increases. In determini ng the value in use of the net 
investment, an entity estimates:

24 LKAS 1 and LKAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
define an item as material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic 
decisions of users of the financial statements. LKAS 1 defines material information and 
requires separate disclosure of material items, including (for example) discontinued 
operations, and  LKAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors requires disclosure of changes in accounting est imates, errors, and changes in 
accounting policies. The two Standards do not contain quantified guidance as to 
materiality. 
31 Under the Conceptual Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of  Financial 
Statements (the Reporting (Conceptual Framework), recognition is the  ‘process of 
incorporating capturing, for inclusion in the balance sheet or income statement of financial 
position or the statement(s) of financial performance, an item that meets the definition of

an element and satisfies  one of the e lements of  the criteria for recognition’  financial 
statements. The definitions of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are fundamental to 
recognition, at the end of both annual and interim financial reporting periods. 
33 An essential characteristic of income (revenue) and expenses is that the related inflows and 
outflows of assets and liabilities have already taken place. If those inflows or outflows 
have taken place, the related revenue and expense are recognised; otherwise they are not 
recognised. The Framework says that ‘expenses are recognised in the income statement 
when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase 
of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably… [The] Conceptual Framework does 
not allow the recognition of items in the balance sheet statement of financial position which 
do not meet the definition of assets or liabilities.’

sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will 
carry out the restructuring. 
If an entity starts to implement a restructuring plan, or announces its main features to those 
affected, only after the reporting period, disclosure is required under LKAS  10 Events 
after the Reporting Period , if the restructuring is material and non ‑disclosure could

STATUS AND PURPOSE OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
SP1.1 The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting  (Conceptual Framework ) describes the 
objective of, and the concepts for, general purpose financial reporting. The purpose of the Conceptual 
Framework is to:  
(a) assist the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (Council) to develop 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (Standards) that are based on consistent concepts; 
(b) assist preparers to develop consistent accounting policies when no Standard applies to a 
particular transaction or other event, or when a Standard allows a choice of accounting policy; 
and 
(c) assist all parties to understand and interpret the Standards. 
SP1.2 The Conceptual Framework is not a Standard. Nothing in the Conceptual Framework overrides any 
Standard or any requirement in a Standard. 
SP1.3 To meet the objective of general purpose financial reporting, the Council may sometimes specify 
requirements that depart from aspects of the Conceptual Framework. If the Council does so, it will 
explain the departure in the Basis for Conclusions on that Standard. 
SP1.4 The Conceptual Framework may be revised from time to time on the basis of the Council’s experience 
of working with it. Revisions of the Conceptual Framework will not automatically lead to changes to 
the Standards. Any decision to amend a Stan dard would require the Council to go through its due 
process for adding a project to its agenda and developing an amendment to that Standard. 
SP1.5 The Conceptual Framework contributes to the stated mission of the Council and the Accounting 
Standards Committee. That mission is to develop Standards that bring transparency, accountability 
and efficiency to financial markets around the world. The Council’s work serves the public interest 
by fostering trust, growth and long -term financial stability in the globa l economy. The Conceptual 
Framework provides the foundation for Standards that:  
(a) contribute to transparency by enhancing the international comparability and quality of financial 
information, enabling investors and other market participants to make info rmed economic 
decisions. 
(b) strengthen accountability by reducing the information gap between the providers of capital and 
the people to whom they have entrusted their money. Standards based on the Conceptual 
Framework provide information needed to hold management to account. As a source of globally 
comparable information, those Standards are also of vital importance to regulators around the 
world. 
(c) contribute to economic efficiency by helping investors to identify opportunities and risks across 
the wor ld, thus improving capital allocation. For businesses, the use of a single, trusted 
accounting language derived from Standards based on the Conceptual Framework lowers the 
cost of capital and reduces international reporting costs.

statements, recognition and derecognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure —flow logically 
from the objective. 
Objective, usefulness and limitations of general purpose financial 
reporting 
1.2 The objective of g eneral purpose financial reporting 1 is to provide financial information about the 
reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making 
decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.2 Those decisions involve decisions about: 
(a) buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments; 
                                                 
1 Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the terms ‘financial reports’ and ‘financial reporting’ refer to general purpose financial 
reports and general purpose financial reporting unless specifically indicated otherwise. 
2 Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the term ‘entity’ refers to the reporting entity unless specifically indicated otherwise.

(b) providing or settling loans and other forms of credit; or 
(c) exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, management’s actions that affect the use of 
the entity’s economic resources. 
1.3 The decisions described in paragraph 1.2 depend on the returns that existing and potential investors, 
lenders and other creditors expect, for example, dividends, principal and interest payments or market 
price increases . Investors’, lenders’ and other creditors’ expectations about returns depend on their 
assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of (the prospects for) future net cash inflows to the 
entity and on their assessment of management’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources. 
Existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors need information to help them make those 
assessments. 
1.4 To make the assessments described in paragraph 1.3, existing and potential investors, lenders and other 
creditors need information about: 
(a) the economic resources of the entity, claims against the entity and changes in those resources and 
claims (see paragraphs 1.12–1.21); and 
(b) how efficiently and effectively the entity’s management and governing board 3 have discharged 
their responsibilities to use the entity’s economic resources (see paragraphs 1.22–1.23). 
1.5 Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to 
provide information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial reports for much of the 
financial information they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose 
financial reports are directed.4 
1.6 However, general purpose financial reports do not and cannot provide all of the information that existing 
and potential investors, lenders and other creditors need. Those users need to consider pertinent 
information from other sources, for example, general economic conditions and expectations, political 
events and political climate, and industry and company outlooks. 
1.7 General purpose financial reports are not designed to show the value of a reporting entity; but they 
provide information to help existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors to estimate the 
value of the reporting entity. 
1.8 Individual primary users have different, and possibly conflicting, information needs and desires. The 
Council, in developing Standards, will seek to provide the information set that will meet the needs of 
the maximum number of primary users. However, focusing on common information needs does not 
prevent the reporting entity from including additional information that is most useful to a particular 
subset of primary users. 
1.9 The management of a reporting entity is also interested in financial information about the entity. 
However, management need not rely on general purpose financial reports because it is able to obtain 
the financial information it needs internally. 
1.10 Other parties, such as regulators and members  of the public other than investors, lenders and other 
creditors, may also find general purpose financial reports useful. However, those reports are not 
primarily directed to these other groups. 
                                                 
3 Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the term ‘management’ refers to management and the governing board of an entity unless 
specifically indicated otherwise. 
4 Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the terms ‘primary users’ and ‘users’ refer to those existing and potential investors, lenders 
and other creditors who must rely on general purpose financial reports for much of the financial information they need.

1.11 To a large extent, financial reports are based on estima tes, judgements and models rather than exact 
depictions. The Conceptual Framework  establishes the concepts that underlie those estimates, 
judgements and models. The concepts are the goal towards which the Coucnil and preparers of financial 
reports strive. As with most goals, the Conceptual Framework’s vision of ideal financial reporting is 
unlikely to be achieved in full, at least not in the short term, because it takes time to understand, accept 
and implement new ways of analysing transactions and other ev ents. Nevertheless, establishing a goal 
towards which to strive is essential if financial reporting is to evolve so as to improve its usefulness. 
Information about a reporting entity’s economic resources, claims 
against the entity and changes in resources and claims 
1.12 General purpose financial reports provide information about the financial position of a reporting entity, 
which is information about the entity’s economic resources and the claims against the reporting entity. 
Financial reports also provide information about the effects of transactions and other events that change 
a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims. Both types of information provide useful input for 
decisions relating to providing resources to an entity. 
Economic resources and claims 
1.13 Information about the nature and amounts of a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims can 
help users to identify the reporting entity’s financial strengths and weaknesses. That information can 
help users to assess the reporting entity’s liquidity and solvency, its needs for additional financing and 
how successful it is likely to be in obtaining that financing. That information can also help users to 
assess management’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources. Information abou t priorities and 
payment requirements of existing claims helps users to predict how future cash flows will be distributed 
among those with a claim against the reporting entity. 
1.14 Different types of economic resources affect a user’s assessment of the reporting entity’s prospects for 
future cash flows differently. Some future cash flows result directly from existing economic resources, 
such as accounts receivable. Other cash flows result from using several resources in combination to 
produce and market goods or services to customers. Although those cash flows cannot be identified with 
individual economic resources (or claims), users of financial reports need to know the nature and amount 
of the resources available for use in a reporting entity’s operations. 
Changes in economic resources and claims 
1.15 Changes in a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims result from that entity’s financial 
performance (see paragraphs 1.17–1.20) and from other events or transactions such as issuing debt or 
equity in struments (see paragraph 1.21). To properly assess both the prospects for future net cash 
inflows to the reporting entity and management’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources, users 
need to be able to identify those two types of changes. 
1.16 Information about a reporting entity’s financial performance helps users to understand the return that 
the entity has produced on its economic resources. Information about the return the entity has produced 
can help users to assess management’s stewardship o f the entity’s economic resources. Information 
about the variability and components of that return is also important, especially in assessing the 
uncertainty of future cash flows. Information about a reporting entity’s past financial performance and 
how it s management discharged its stewardship responsibilities is usually helpful in predicting the 
entity’s future returns on its economic resources.

Financial performance reflected by accrual accounting 
1.17 Accrual accounting depicts the effects of transactions and other events and circumstances on a reporting 
entity’s economic resources and claims in the periods in which those effects occur, even if the resulting 
cash receipts and payments occur in a different period. This is important because information abo ut a 
reporting entity’s economic resources and claims and changes in its economic resources and claims 
during a period provides a better basis for assessing the entity’s past and future performance than 
information solely about cash receipts and payments during that period. 
1.18 Information about a reporting entity’s financial performance during a period, reflected by changes in its 
economic resources and claims other than by obtaining additional resources directly from investors and 
creditors (see paragraph 1.21), is useful in assessing the entity’s past and future ability to generate net 
cash inflows. That information indicates the extent to which the reporting entity has increased its 
available economic resources, and thus its capacity for generating net cash inflows through its operations 
rather than by obtaining additional resources directly from investors and creditors. Information about a 
reporting entity’s financial performance during a period can also help users to assess management’s 
stewardship of the entity’s economic resources. 
1.19 Information about a reporting entity’s financial performance during a period may also indicate the extent 
to which events such as changes in market prices or interest rates have increased or decreased the entity’s 
economic resources and claims, thereby affecting the entity’s ability to generate net cash inflows. 
Financial performance reflected by past cash flows 
1.20 Information about a reporting entity’s cash flows during a period also helps users to assess the entity’ s 
ability to generate future net cash inflows and to assess management’s stewardship of the entity’s 
economic resources. That information indicates how the reporting entity obtains and spends cash, 
including information about its borrowing and repayment of  debt, cash dividends or other cash 
distributions to investors, and other factors that may affect the entity’s liquidity or solvency. Information 
about cash flows helps users understand a reporting entity’s operations, evaluate its financing and 
investing activities, assess its liquidity or solvency and interpret other information about financial 
performance. 
Changes in economic resources and claims not resulting from 
financial performance 
1.21 A reporting entity’s economic resources and claims may also cha nge for reasons other than financial 
performance, such as issuing debt or equity instruments. Information about this type of change is 
necessary to give users a complete understanding of why the reporting entity’s economic resources and 
claims changed and the implications of those changes for its future financial performance. 
Information about use of the entity’s economic resources 
1.22 Information about how efficiently and effectively the reporting entity’s management has discharged its 
responsibilities to use the entity’s economic resources helps users to assess management’s stewardship 
of those resources. Such information is also useful for predicting how efficiently and effectively 
management will use the entity’s economic resources in future periods. He nce, it can be useful for 
assessing the entity’s prospects for future net cash inflows.

1.23 Examples of management’s responsibilities to use the entity’s economic resources include protecting 
those resources from unfavourable effects of economic factors, such as price and technological changes, 
and ensuring that the entity complies with applicable laws, regulations and contractual provisions.

THE COST CONSTRAINT ON USEFUL FINANCIAL REPORTING 2.39 
Introduction 
2.1 The qualitative characteristics of useful financial information discussed in this chapter identify the types 
of information that are likely to be most useful to the existing and potential investors, lenders and other 
creditors for making decisions about the reporting entity on the basis of information in its financial 
report (financial information). 
2.2 Financial reports provide information about the reporting entity’s economic resources, claims against 
the reporting entity and the effects of transactions and other events and conditions that change those 
resources and claims. (This information is referred to in the Conceptual Framework as information 
about the economic phenomena.) Some financial reports also include explanatory material about 
management’s expectations and strategies for the reporting entity, and other types of forward -looking 
information.

2.3 The qualitative characteristics of useful financial information5 apply to financial information provided 
in financial statements, as w ell as to financial information provided in other ways. Cost, which is a 
pervasive constraint on the reporting entity’s ability to provide useful financial information, applies 
similarly. However, the considerations in applying the qualitative characteristics and the cost constraint 
may be different for different types of information. For example, applying them to forward -looking 
information may be different from applying them to information about existing economic resources and 
claims and to changes in those resources and claims. 
Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information 
2.4 If financial information is to be useful, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to 
represent. The usefulness of financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and 
understandable. 
Fundamental qualitative characteristics 
2.5 The fundamental qualitative characteristics are relevance and faithful representation. 
Relevance 
2.6 Relevant financial information is capable of mak ing a difference in the decisions made by users. 
Information may be capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to take 
advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources. 
2.7 Financial information is capable of making a difference in decisions if it has predictive value, 
confirmatory value or both. 
2.8 Financial information has predictive value if it can be used as an input to processes employed by users 
to predict future outcomes. Financial information need not be a prediction or forecast to have predictive 
value. Financial information with predictive value is employed by users in making their own predictions. 
2.9 Financial information has confirmatory value if it provides feedback about (confirms or changes) 
previous evaluations. 
2.10 The predictive value and confirmatory value of financial information are interrelated. Information that 
has predictive value often also has confirmatory value. For example, revenue information for the current 
year, which can be used as the basis for predicting revenues in future years, can also be compared with 
revenue predictions for the current year that were made in past years. The results of those comparisons 
can help a user to correct and improve the processes that were used to make those previous predictions. 
Materiality 
2.11 Information is material if omitting it or misstating it could influence decisions that the primary users of 
general purpose financial reports (see paragraph 1.5) make on the basis of those reports, which provide 
financial information about a specific reporting entity. In other words, materiality is an entity -specific 
aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information 
relates in the context of an individual entity’s financial report. Consequently, the Council cannot specify 
a uniform quantitative threshold for materiality or predetermine what could be material in a particular 
situation. 
                                                 
5 Throughout the Conceptual Framework , the terms ‘qualitative characteristics’ and ‘cost constraint’ refer to the qualitative 
characteristics of, and the cost constraint on, useful financial information.

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
Faithful representation 
2.12 Financial reports represent economic phenomena  in words and numbers. To be useful, financial 
information must not only represent relevant phenomena, but it must also faithfully represent the 
substance of the phenomena that it purports to represent. In many circumstances, the substance of an 
economic phenomenon and its legal form are the same. If they are not the same, providing information 
only about the legal form would not faithfully represent the economic phenomenon (see paragraphs 
4.59–4.62). 
2.13 To be a perfectly faithful representation, a depict ion would have three characteristics. It would be 
complete, neutral and free from error. Of course, perfection is seldom, if ever, achievable. The Council’s 
objective is to maximise those qualities to the extent possible. 
2.14 A complete depiction includes all information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon being 
depicted, including all necessary descriptions and explanations. For example, a complete depiction of a 
group of assets would include, at a minimum, a description of the nature of the  assets in the group, a 
numerical depiction of all of the assets in the group, and a description of what the numerical depiction 
represents (for example, historical cost or fair value). For some items, a complete depiction may also 
entail explanations of s ignificant facts about the quality and nature of the items, factors and 
circumstances that might affect their quality and nature, and the process used to determine the numerical 
depiction. 
2.15 A neutral depiction is without bias in the selection or presen tation of financial information. A neutral 
depiction is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipulated to increase the 
probability that financial information will be received favourably or unfavourably by users. Neutral 
information does not mean information with no purpose or no influence on behaviour. On the contrary, 
relevant financial information is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users’ decisions. 
2.16 Neutrality is supported by the exercise of prudence. Prud ence is the exercise of caution when making 
judgements under conditions of uncertainty. The exercise of prudence means that assets and income are 
not overstated and liabilities and expenses are not understated.6 Equally, the exercise of prudence does 
not allow for the understatement of assets or income or the overstatement of liabilities or expenses. Such 
misstatements can lead to the overstatement or understatement of income or expenses in future periods. 
2.17 The exercise of prudence does not imply a need for asymmetry, for example, a systematic need for more 
persuasive evidence to support the recognition of assets or income than the recognition of liabilities or 
expenses. Such asymmetry is not a qualitative characteristic of useful financial information. 
Nevertheless, particular Standards may contain asymmetric requirements if this is a consequence of 
decisions intended to select the most relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to 
represent. 
2.18 Faithful representation does not mean accurate in all respects. Free from error means there are no errors 
or omissions in the description of the phenomenon, and the process used to produce the reported 
information has been selected and applied with no errors in the process. In this context, free from error 
does not mean perfectly accurate in all respects. For example, an estimate of an unobservable price or 
value cannot be determined to be accurate or inaccurate. However, a representation of that estimate can 
be faithful if the amount is des cribed clearly and accurately as being an estimate, the nature and 
limitations of the estimating process are explained, and no errors have been made in selecting and 
applying an appropriate process for developing the estimate. 
2.19 When monetary amounts in financial reports cannot be observed directly and must instead be estimated, 
measurement uncertainty arises. The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation 
of financial information and does not undermine the usefulness of the info rmation if the estimates are 
                                                 
6 Assets, liabilities, income and expenses are defined in Table 4.1. They are the elements of financial statements.

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
clearly and accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty does not 
necessarily prevent such an estimate from providing useful information (see paragraph 2.22). 
Applying the fundamental qualitative characteristics 
2.20 Information must both be relevant and provide a faithful representation of what it purports to represent 
if it is to be useful. Neither a faithful representation of an irrelevant phenomenon nor an unfaithful 
representation of a relevant phenomenon helps users make good decisions. 
2.21 The most efficient and effective process for applying the fundamental qualitative characteristics would 
usually be as follows (subject to the effects of enhancing characteristics and the cost constrai nt, which 
are not considered in this example). First, identify an economic phenomenon, information about which 
is capable of being useful to users of the reporting entity’s financial information. Second, identify the 
type of information about that phenomenon that would be most relevant. Third, determine whether that 
information is available and whether it can provide a faithful representation of the economic 
phenomenon. If so, the process of satisfying the fundamental qualitative characteristics ends at tha t 
point. If not, the process is repeated with the next most relevant type of information. 
2.22 In some cases, a trade-off between the fundamental qualitative characteristics may need to be made in 
order to meet the objective of financial reporting, which is to provide useful information about economic 
phenomena. For example, the most relevant information about a phenomenon may be a highly uncertain 
estimate. In some cases, the level of measurement uncertainty involved in making that estimate may be 
so high that it may be questionable whether the estimate would provide a sufficiently faithful 
representation of that phenomenon. In some such cases, the most useful information may be the highly 
uncertain estimate, accompanied by a description of the estimate and an explanation of the uncertainties 
that affect it. In other such cases, if that information would not provide a sufficiently faithful 
representation of that phenomenon, the most useful information may include an estimate of another type 
that is slightly less relevant but is subject to lower measurement uncertainty. In limited circumstances, 
there may be no estimate that provides useful information. In those limited circumstances, it may be 
necessary to provide information that does not rely on an estimate. 
Enhancing qualitative characteristics 
2.23 Comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability are qualitative characteristics that enhance 
the usefulness of information that both is relevant and provides a faithful representation of what it 
purports to represent. The enhancing qualitative characteristics may also help determine which of two 
ways should be used to depict a phenomenon if both are considered to provide equally relevant 
information and an equally faithful representation of that phenomenon. 
Comparability 
2.24 Users’ decisions involve choosing between alternatives, for example, selling or holding an investment, 
or investing in one reporting entity or another. Consequently, information about a reporting entity is 
more useful if it ca n be compared with similar information about other entities and with similar 
information about the same entity for another period or another date. 
2.25 Comparability is the qualitative characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similariti es 
in, and differences among, items. Unlike the other qualitative characteristics, comparability does not 
relate to a single item. A comparison requires at least two items. 
2.26 Consistency, although related to comparability, is not the same. Consistency r efers to the use of the 
same methods for the same items, either from period to period within a reporting entity or in a single 
period across entities. Comparability is the goal; consistency helps to achieve that goal.

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020 
2.27 Comparability is not uniformity. For information to be comparable, like things must look alike and 
different things must look different. Comparability of financial information is not enhanced by making 
unlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making like things look different. 
2.28 Some degree of comparability is likely to be attained by satisfying the fundamental qualitative 
characteristics. A faithful representation of a relevant economic phenomenon should naturally possess 
some degree of comparability with a faithful representation of a similar relevant economic phenomenon 
by another reporting entity. 
2.29 Although a single economic phenomenon can be faithfully represented in multiple ways, permitting 
alternative accounting methods for the same economic phenomenon diminishes comparability. 
Verifiability 
2.30 Verifiability helps assure users that information faithfully represents the economic phenomena it 
purports to represent. Verifiability means that different knowledgeable and independent observers could 
reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful 
representation. Quantified information need not be a single point estimate to be verifiable. A range of 
possible amounts and the related probabilities can also be verified. 
2.31 Verification can be direct or indirect. Direct verification means verifying an amount or other 
representation through direct observation, for example, by counting cash. Indirect verification means 
checking the inputs to a model, formula or other technique and recalculating the outputs using the same 
methodology. An example is verifying the carrying amount of inventory by checking the inputs 
(quantities and costs) and recalculating the ending inventory using the same cost flow assumption (for 
example, using the first-in, first-out method). 
2.32 It may not be possible to verify some explanations and forward-looking financial information until a 
future period, if at all. To help users decide whether they want to use that information, it would normally 
be necessary to disclose the underlying assumptions, the methods of compiling the information and 
other factors and circumstances that support the information. 
Timeliness 
2.33 Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to be capable of influencing 
their decisions. Generally, the older the information is the less useful it is. However, some information 
may continue to be timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users may 
need to identify and assess trends. 
Understandability 
2.34 Classifying, characterising and presenting information clearly and concisely makes it understandable. 
2.35 Some phenomena are inherently complex and cannot be made easy to understand. Excluding 
information about those phenomena from financial reports might make the information in those financial 
reports easier to understand. However, those reports would be incomplete and therefore possibly 
misleading. 
2.36 Financial reports are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic 
activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At times, even well-informed and 
diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex economic 
phenomena. 
Applying the enhancing qualitative characteristics 
2.37 Enhancing qualitative characteristics should be maximised to the extent possible. However, the 
enhancing qualitative characteristics, either individually or as a group, cannot make information useful

if that i nformation is irrelevant or does not provide a faithful representation of what it purports to 
represent. 
2.38 Applying the enhancing qualitative characteristics is an iterative process that does not follow a 
prescribed order. Sometimes, one enhancing quali tative characteristic may have to be diminished to 
maximise another qualitative characteristic. For example, a temporary reduction in comparability as a 
result of prospectively applying a new Standard may be worthwhile to improve relevance or faithful 
representation in the longer term. Appropriate disclosures may partially compensate for non -
comparability. 
The cost constraint on useful financial reporting 
2.39 Cost is a pervasive constraint on the information that can be provided by financial reporting. Reporting 
financial information imposes costs, and it is important that those costs are justified by the benefits of 
reporting that information. There are several types of costs and benefits to consider. 
2.40 Providers of financial information expend most of the effort involved in collecting, processing, verifying 
and disseminating financial information, but users ultimately bear those costs in the form of reduced 
returns. Users of financial information also incur costs of analysing and interpreting the inf ormation 
provided. If needed information is not provided, users incur additional costs to obtain that information 
elsewhere or to estimate it. 
2.41 Reporting financial information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent 
helps users to make decisions with more confidence. This results in more efficient functioning of capital 
markets and a lower cost of capital for the economy as a whole. An individual investor, lender or other 
creditor also receives benefits by making more in formed decisions. However, it is not possible for 
general purpose financial reports to provide all the information that every user finds relevant. 
2.42 In applying the cost constraint, the Council assesses whether the benefits of reporting particular 
information are likely to justify the costs incurred to provide and use that information. When applying 
the cost constraint in developing a proposed Standard, the Coulncil seeks information from providers of 
financial information, users, auditors, academics and  others about the expected nature and quantity of 
the benefits and costs of that Standard. In most situations, assessments are based on a combination of 
quantitative and qualitative information. 
2.43 Because of the inherent subjectivity, different individu als’ assessments of the costs and benefits of 
reporting particular items of financial information will vary. Therefore, the Council seeks to consider 
costs and benefits in relation to financial reporting generally, and not just in relation to individual 
reporting entities. That does not mean that assessments of costs and benefits always justify the same 
reporting requirements for all entities. Differences may be appropriate because of different sizes of 
entities, different ways of raising capital (publicly or privately), different users’ needs or other factors.

Financial statements 
3.1 Chapters 1 and 2 discuss information provided in general purpose financial reports and Chapters 3 –8 
discuss information provided in general purpose financial statements, which are a particular form of 
general purpose financial reports. Financial statements7 provide information about economic resources 
of the reporting entity, claims against the entity, and changes in those resources and claims, that meet 
the definitions of the elements of financial statements (see Table 4.1). 
Objective and scope of financial statements 
3.2 The objective of financial statements is to prov ide financial information about the reporting entity’s 
assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses8 that is useful to users of financial statements in assessing 
the prospects for future net cash inflows to the reporting entity and in assessing managem ent’s 
stewardship of the entity’s economic resources (see paragraph 1.3). 
3.3 That information is provided: 
(a) in the statement of financial position, by recognising assets, liabilities and equity; 
(b) in the statement(s) of financial performance,9 by recognising income and expenses; and 
(c) in other statements and notes, by presenting and disclosing information about: 
(i) recognised assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses (see paragraph 5.1), including 
information about their nature and about the risks arising from those recognised assets and 
liabilities; 
(ii) assets and liabilities that have not been recognised (see paragraph 5.6), including 
information about their nature and about the risks arising from them; 
(iii) cash flows; 
(iv) contributions from holders of equity claims and distributions to them; and 
(v) the methods, assumptions and judgements used in estimating the amounts presented or 
disclosed, and changes in those methods, assumptions and judgements. 
                                                 
7 Throughout the Conceptual Framework, the term ‘financial statements’ refers to general purpose financial statements. 
8 Assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are defined in Table 4.1. They are the elements of financial statements. 
9 The Conceptual Framework does not specify whether the statement(s) of financial performance comprise(s) a single statement or 
two statements.

Reporting period 
3.4 Financial statem ents are prepared for a specified period of time (reporting period) and provide 
information about: 
(a) assets and liabilities —including unrecognised assets and liabilities —and equity that existed at 
the end of the reporting period, or during the reporting period; and 
(b) income and expenses for the reporting period. 
3.5 To help users of financial statements to identify and assess changes and trends, financial statements also 
provide comparative information for at least one preceding reporting period. 
3.6 Information about possible future transactions and other possible future events (forward -looking 
information) is included in financial statements if it: 
(a) relates to the entity’s assets or liabilities—including unrecognised assets or liabilities—or equity 
that existed at the end of the reporting period, or during the reporting period, or to income or 
expenses for the reporting period; and 
(b) is useful to users of financial statements. 
 For example, if an asset or liability is measured by estimating future cash flows, information about those 
estimated future cash flows may help users of financial statements to understand the reported measures. 
Financial statements do not typically provide other types of forward-looking information, for example, 
explanatory material about management’s expectations and strategies for the reporting entity. 
3.7 Financial statements include information about transactions and other events that have occurred after 
the end of the reporting period if providing that information is nece ssary to meet the objective of 
financial statements (see paragraph 3.2). 
Perspective adopted in financial statements 
3.8 Financial statements provide information about transactions and other events viewed from the 
perspective of the reporting entity as a w hole, not from the perspective of any particular group of the 
entity’s existing or potential investors, lenders or other creditors. 
Going concern assumption 
3.9 Financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that the reporting entity is a going concern 
and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the entity has neither 
the intention nor the need to enter liquidation or to cease trading. If such an intention or need exists, the 
financial statements may have to be prepared on a different basis. If so, the financial statements describe 
the basis used. 
The reporting entity 
3.10 A reporting entity is an entity that is required, or chooses, to prepare financial statements. A reporting 
entity can be a single entity or a portion of an entity or can comprise more than one entity. A reporting 
entity is not necessarily a legal entity. 
 
3.11 Sometimes one entity (parent) has control over another entity (subsidiary). If a reporting entity 
comprises both the parent and its subsidiaries, the reporting entity’s financial statements are referred to 
as ‘consolidated financial statements’ (see paragr aphs 3.15–3.16). If a reporting entity is the parent 

<!-- page 36 -->

36A I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
alone, the reporting entity’s financial statements are referred to as ‘unconsolidated financial statements’ 
(see paragraphs 3.17–3.18). 
 
3.12 If a reporting entity comprises two or more entities that are  not all linked by a parent -subsidiary 
relationship, the reporting entity’s financial statements are referred to as ‘combined financial 
statements’. 
3.13 Determining the appropriate boundary of a reporting entity can be difficult if the reporting entity:  
(a) is not a legal entity; and 
(b) does not comprise only legal entities linked by a parent-subsidiary relationship. 
3.14 In such cases, determining the boundary of the reporting entity is driven by the information needs of the 
primary users of the reporting entity’s financial statements. Those users need relevant information that 
faithfully represents what it purports to represent. Faithful representation requires that: 
(a) the boundary of the reporting entity does not contain an arbitrary or incomplete set of economic 
activities; 
(b) including that set of economic activities within the boundary of the reporting entity results in 
neutral information; and 
(c) a description is provided of how the boundary of the reporting entity was determined and of what 
constitutes the reporting entity. 
Consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements 
3.15 Consolidated financial statements provide information about the assets, liabilities, equity, income and 
expenses of both the parent and its subsidiaries as a single re porting entity. That information is useful 
for existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of the parent in their assessment of the 
prospects for future net cash inflows to the parent. This is because net cash inflows to the parent include 
distributions to the parent from its subsidiaries, and those distributions depend on net cash inflows to 
the subsidiaries. 
3.16 Consolidated financial statements are not designed to provide separate information about the assets, 
liabilities, equity, inco me and expenses of any particular subsidiary. A subsidiary’s own financial 
statements are designed to provide that information. 
3.17 Unconsolidated financial statements are designed to provide information about the parent’s assets, 
liabilities, equity, income and expenses, and not about those of its subsidiaries. That information can be 
useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of the parent because: 
(a) a claim against the parent typically does not give the holder of that clai m a claim against 
subsidiaries; and 
(b) in some jurisdictions, the amounts that can be legally distributed to holders of equity claims 
against the parent depend on the distributable reserves of the parent. 
 Another way to provide information about some or all assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses 
of the parent alone is in consolidated financial statements, in the notes. 
3.18 Information provided in unconsolidated financial statements is typically not sufficient to meet the 
information needs of existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of the parent. 
Accordingly, when consolidated financial statements are required, unconsolidated financial statements 
cannot serve as a substitute for consolidated financial statements. Neverthel ess, a parent may be 
required, or choose, to prepare unconsolidated financial statements in addition to consolidated financial 
statements.

result in decreases in equity, other than those 
relating to distributions to holders of equity claims. 
Other changes in 
economic resources 
and claims 
– Contributions from holders of equity claims, and 
distributions to them. 
– Exchanges of assets or liabilities that do not result

Definition of an asset 
4.3 An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. 
4.4 An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits. 
4.5 This section discusses three aspects of those definitions: 
(a) right (see paragraphs 4.6–4.13); 
(b) potential to produce economic benefits (see paragraphs 4.14–4.18); and 
(c) control (see paragraphs 4.19–4.25).

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
Right 
4.6 Rights that have the potential to produce economic benefits take many forms, including: 
(a) rights that correspond to an obligation of another party (see paragraph 4.39), for example: 
(i) rights to receive cash. 
(ii) rights to receive goods or services. 
(iii) rights to exchange economic resources with another party on favourable terms. Such rights 
include, for example, a forward contract to buy an economic resource on terms that are 
currently favourable or an option to buy an economic resource. 
(iv) rights to benefit from an obligation of another party to transfer an economic resource if a 
specified uncertain future event occurs (see paragraph 4.37). 
(b) rights that do not correspond to an obligation of another party, for example: 
(i) rights over physical objects, such as  property, plant and equipment or inventories. 
Examples of such rights are a right to use a physical object or a right to benefit from the 
residual value of a leased object. 
(ii) rights to use intellectual property. 
4.7 Many rights are established by contr act, legislation or similar means. For example, an entity might 
obtain rights from owning or leasing a physical object, from owning a debt instrument or an equity 
instrument, or from owning a registered patent. However, an entity might also obtain rights i n other 
ways, for example: 
(a) by acquiring or creating know-how that is not in the public domain (see paragraph 4.22); or 
(b) through an obligation of another party that arises because that other party has no practical ability 
to act in a manner inconsist ent with its customary practices, published policies or specific 
statements (see paragraph 4.31). 
4.8 Some goods or services —for example, employee services —are received and immediately consumed. 
An entity’s right to obtain the economic benefits produced by such goods or services exists momentarily 
until the entity consumes the goods or services. 
4.9 Not all of an entity’s rights are assets of that entity—to be assets of the entity, the rights must both have 
the potential to produce for the entity economic b enefits beyond the economic benefits available to all 
other parties (see paragraphs 4.14–4.18) and be controlled by the entity (see paragraphs 4.19–4.25). For 
example, rights available to all parties without significant cost—for instance, rights of access to public 
goods, such as public rights of way over land, or know-how that is in the public domain—are typically 
not assets for the entities that hold them. 
4.10 An entity cannot have a right to obtain economic benefits from itself. Hence: 
(a) debt instruments or equity instruments issued by the entity and repurchased and held by it —for 
example, treasury shares—are not economic resources of that entity; and 
(b) if a reporting entity comprises more than one legal entity, debt instruments or equity instruments 
issued by one of those legal entities and held by another of those legal entities are not economic 
resources of the reporting entity. 
4.11 In principle, each of an entity’s rights is a separate asset. However, for accounting purposes, related 
rights are often treated as a single unit of account that is a single asset (see paragraphs 4.48 –4.55). For 
example, legal ownership of a physical object may give rise to several rights, including: 

<!-- page 40 -->

40A I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
(a) the right to use the object; 
(b) the right to sell rights over the object; 
(c) the right to pledge rights over the object; and 
(d) other rights not listed in (a)–(c). 
4.12 In many cases, the set of rights arising from legal ownership of a physical object is accounted for as a 
single asset. Conceptually, the economic reso urce is the set of rights, not the physical object. 
Nevertheless, describing the set of rights as the physical object will often provide a faithful 
representation of those rights in the most concise and understandable way. 
4.13 In some cases, it is uncerta in whether a right exists. For example, an entity and another party might 
dispute whether the entity has a right to receive an economic resource from that other party. Until that 
existence uncertainty is resolved—for example, by a court ruling—it is uncertain whether the entity has 
a right and, consequently, whether an asset exists. (Paragraph 5.14 discusses recognition of assets whose 
existence is uncertain.) 
Potential to produce economic benefits 
4.14 An economic resource is a right that has the potential  to produce economic benefits. For that potential 
to exist, it does not need to be certain, or even likely, that the right will produce economic benefits. It is 
only necessary that the right already exists and that, in at least one circumstance, it would p roduce for 
the entity economic benefits beyond those available to all other parties. 
4.15 A right can meet the definition of an economic resource, and hence can be an asset, even if the 
probability that it will produce economic benefits is low. Nevertheless, that low probability might affect 
decisions about what information to provide about the asset and how to provide that information, 
including decisions about whether the asset is recognised (see paragraphs 5.15 –5.17) and how it is 
measured. 
4.16 An economic resource could produce economic benefits for an entity by entitling or enabling it to do, 
for example, one or more of the following: 
(a) receive contractual cash flows or another economic resource; 
(b) exchange economic resources with another party on favourable terms; 
(c) produce cash inflows or avoid cash outflows by, for example: 
(i) using the economic resource either individually or in combination with other economic 
resources to produce goods or provide services; 
(ii) using the economic resource to enhance the value of other economic resources; or 
(iii) leasing the economic resource to another party; 
(d) receive cash or other economic resources by selling the economic resource; or 
(e) extinguish liabilities by transferring the economic resource. 
4.17 Although an economic resource derives its value from its present potential to produce future economic 
benefits, the economic resource is the present right that contains that potential, not the future economic 
benefits that the right may produce. For example, a purchased option derives its value from its potential 
to produce economic benefits through exercise of the option at a future date. However, the economic 
resource is the present right—the right to exercise the option at a future date. The economic resource is 
not the future economic benefits that the holder will receive if the option is exercised. 
4.18 There is a close association between incurring expenditure and acquiring assets, but the two do not 
necessarily coincide. Hence, when an entity incurs expenditure, this may provide evidence that the entity 
has sought future economic benefits, but does not provide conclusive proof that the entity has obtained 

<!-- page 41 -->

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020 
an asset. Similarly, the absence of related expenditure does not preclude an item from meeting the 
definition of an asset. Assets can include, for example, rights that a government has granted to the entity 
free of charge or that another party has donated to the entity. 
Control 
4.19 Control links an economic resource to an entity. Assessing whether control exists helps to identify the 
economic resource for which the entity accounts. For example, an entity may control a proportionate 
share in a property without controlling the rights arising from ownership of the entire property. In such 
cases, the ent ity’s asset is the share in the property, which it controls, not the rights arising from 
ownership of the entire property, which it does not control. 
4.20 An entity controls an economic resource if it has the present ability to direct the use of the economic 
resource and obtain the economic benefits that may flow from it. Control includes the present ability to 
prevent other parties from directing the use of the economic resource and from obtaining the economic 
benefits that may flow from it. It follows that, if one party controls an economic resource, no other party 
controls that resource. 
4.21 An entity has the present ability to direct the use of an economic resource if it has the right to deploy 
that economic resource in its activities, or to allow another party to deploy the economic resource in 
that other party’s activities. 
4.22 Control of an economic resource usually arises from an ability to enforce legal rights. However, control 
can also arise if an entity has other means of ensuring that it, and no other party, has the present ability 
to direct the use of the economic resource and obtain the benefits that may flow from it. For example, 
an entity could control a right to use know-how that is not in the public domain if the entity has access 
to the kn ow-how and the present ability to keep the know-how secret, even if that know-how is not 
protected by a registered patent. 
4.23 For an entity to control an economic resource, the future economic benefits from that resource must 
flow to the entity either directly or indirectly rather than to another party. This aspect of control does 
not imply that the entity can ensure that the resource will produce economic benefits in all 
circumstances. Instead, it means that if the resource produces economic benefits, the entity is the party 
that will obtain them either directly or indirectly. 
4.24 Having exposure to significant variations in the amount of the economic benefits produced by an 
economic resource may indicate that the entity controls the resource. However, it is only one factor to 
consider in the overall assessment of whether control exists. 
4.25 Sometimes one party (a principal) engages another party (an agent) to act on behalf of, and for the 
benefit of, the principal. For example, a principal may engage an agent to arrange sales of goods 
controlled by the principal. If an agent has custody of an economic resource controlled by the principal, 
that economic resource is not an asset of the agent. Furthermore, if the agent has an obligation to transfer 
to a third party an economic resource controlled by the principal, that obligation is not a liability of the 
agent, because the economic resource that would be transferred is the principal’s economic resource, 
not the agent’s. 
Definition of a liability 
4.26 A liability is a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events. 
4.27 For a liability to exist, three criteria must all be satisfied: 
(a) the entity has an obligation (see paragraphs 4.28 –4.35);

<!-- page 42 -->

42A I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
(b) the obligation is to transfer an economic resource (see paragraphs 4.36–4.41); and 
(c) the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past events (see paragraphs 4.42 –
4.47). 
Obligation 
4.28 The first criterion for a liability is that the entity has an obligation. 
4.29 An obligation is a duty or responsibility that an entity has no practical ability to avoid. An obligation is 
always owed to another party (or parties). The other party (or parties) could be a person or another 
entity, a group of people or other entities, or society at large. It is not necessary to know the identity of 
the party (or parties) to whom the obligation is owed. 
4.30 If one party has an obligation to transfer an economic resource, it follows that another party (or parties) 
has a right to receive that economic resource. However, a requirement for one party to recognise a 
liability and measure it at a specified amount does not imply that the other party (or parties) must 
recognise an asset or measure it at the same amount. For exam ple, particular Standards may contain 
different recognition criteria or measurement requirements for the liability of one party and the 
corresponding asset of the other party (or parties) if those different criteria or requirements are a 
consequence of decisions intended to select the most relevant information that faithfully represents what 
it purports to represent. 
4.31 Many obligations are established by contract, legislation or similar means and are legally enforceable 
by the party (or parties) to whom they are owed. Obligations can also arise, however, from an entity’s 
customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the entity has no practical ability to act 
in a manner inconsistent with those practices, policies or statements. The obl igation that arises in such 
situations is sometimes referred to as a ‘constructive obligation’. 
4.32 In some situations, an entity’s duty or responsibility to transfer an economic resource is conditional on 
a particular future action that the entity itself may take. Such actions could include operating a particular 
business or operating in a particular market on a specified future date, or exercising particular options 
within a contract. In such situations, the entity has an obligation if it has no practica l ability to avoid 
taking that action. 
4.33 A conclusion that it is appropriate to prepare an entity’s financial statements on a going concern basis 
also implies a conclusion that the entity has no practical ability to avoid a transfer that could be avoided 
only by liquidating the entity or by ceasing to trade. 
4.34 The factors used to assess whether an entity has the practical ability to avoid transferring an economic 
resource may depend on the nature of the entity’s duty or responsibility. For example, in some cases, an 
entity may have no practical ability to avoid a transfer if any action that it could take to avoid the transfer 
would have economic consequences significantly more adverse than the transfer itself. However, neither 
an intention to make a tr ansfer, nor a high likelihood of a transfer, is sufficient reason for concluding 
that the entity has no practical ability to avoid a transfer. 
4.35 In some cases, it is uncertain whether an obligation exists. For example, if another party is seeking 
compensation for an entity’s alleged act of wrongdoing, it might be uncertain whether the act occurred, 
whether the entity committed it or how the law applies. Until that existence uncertainty is resolved —
for example, by a court ruling—it is uncertain whether the entity has an obligation to the party seeking 
compensation and, consequently, whether a liability exists. (Paragraph 5.14 discusses recognition of 
liabilities whose existence is uncertain.) 
Transfer of an economic resource 
4.36 The second criterion for a liability is that the obligation is to transfer an economic resource. 

<!-- page 43 -->

 I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 43A 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
4.37 To satisfy this criterion, the obligation must have the potential to require the entity to transfer an 
economic resource to another party (or parties). For that potential to exist, it does not need to be certain, 
or even likely, that the entity will be required to transfer an economic resource —the transfer may, for 
example, be required only if a specified uncertain future event occurs. It is only necessary that the 
obligation already exists and that, in at least one circumstance, it would require the entity to transfer an 
economic resource. 
4.38 An obligation can meet the definition of a liability even if the probability of a transfer of an economic 
resource is low. Nevertheless, tha t low probability might affect decisions about what information to 
provide about the liability and how to provide that information, including decisions about whether the 
liability is recognised (see paragraphs 5.15–5.17) and how it is measured. 
4.39 Obligations to transfer an economic resource include, for example: 
(a) obligations to pay cash. 
(b) obligations to deliver goods or provide services. 
(c) obligations to exchange economic resources with another party on unfavourable terms. Such 
obligations include, for example, a forward contract to sell an economic resource on terms that 
are currently unfavourable or an option that entitles another party to buy an economic resource 
from the entity. 
(d) obligations to transfer an economic resource if a specified uncertain future event occurs. 
(e) obligations to issue a financial instrument if that financial instrument will oblige the entity to 
transfer an economic resource. 
4.40 Instead of fulfilling an obligation to transfer an economic resource to the party that has a right to receive 
that resource, entities sometimes decide to, for example: 
(a) settle the obligation by negotiating a release from the obligation; 
(b) transfer the obligation to a third party; or 
(c) replace that obligation to transfer an economic resource with another obligation by entering into 
a new transaction. 
4.41 In the situations described in paragraph 4.40, an entity has the obligation to transfer an economic 
resource until it has settled, transferred or replaced that obligation. 
Present obligation as a result of past events 
4.42 The third criterion for a liability is that the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past 
events. 
4.43 A present obligation exists as a result of past events only if: 
(a) the entity has already obtained economic benefits or taken an action; and 
(b) as a consequence, the entity will or may have to transfer an economic resource that it would not 
otherwise have had to transfer. 
4.44 The economic benefits obtained could include, for example, goods or services. The action taken could 
include, for example, operating a particular business or operating in a particular market. If economic 
benefits are obtained, or an action is taken, over time, the resulting present obligation may accumulate 
over that time.

4.45 If new legislation is enacted, a present obligation arises only when, as a consequence of obtaining 
economic benefits or taking an action to which that legislation applies, an entity will or may have to 
transfer an economic resource that it would not otherwise have had to transfer. The enactment of 
legislation is not in itself sufficient to give an entity a present obligation. Similarly, an entity’s customary 
practice, published policy or specific statement of the type mentioned in paragraph 4.31 gives rise to a 
present obligation only when, as a consequence of obtaining economic benefits, or taking an action, to 
which that practice, policy or statement applies, the entity will or may have to transfer an economic 
resource that it would not otherwise have had to transfer. 
4.46 A present obligation can exist even if a transfer of economic resources cannot be enforced until some 
point in the future. For example, a contractual liability to pay cash may exist now even if the contract 
does not require a payment until a future date. Similarly, a contractual obligation for an entity to perform 
work at a future date may exist now even if the counterparty cannot require the entity to perform the 
work until that future date. 
4.47 An entity does not yet have a present obligation to transfer an economic resource if it has not yet satisfied 
the criteria in paragraph 4.43, that is, if it has not yet obtained economic benefits, or taken an action, 
that would or could require the entity to transfer an economic resource that it would not otherwise have 
had to transfer. For example, if an entity has entered into a contract to pay an employee a salary in 
exchange for receiving the employee’s services, the entity does not have a present obligation to pay the 
salary until it has received the employee’s services. Before then the contract is executory —the entity 
has a combined right and obligation to exchange future salary for future employee services (see 
paragraphs 4.56–4.58). 
Assets and liabilities 
Unit of account 
4.48 The unit of account is the right or the group of rights, the obligation or the group of obligations, or the 
group of rights and obligations, to which recognition criteria and measurement concepts are applied. 
4.49 A unit of account is selected for an asse t or liability when considering how recognition criteria and 
measurement concepts will apply to that asset or liability and to the related income and expenses. In 
some circumstances, it may be appropriate to select one unit of account for recognition and a  different 
unit of account for measurement. For example, contracts may sometimes be recognised individually but 
measured as part of a portfolio of contracts. For presentation and disclosure, assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses may need to be aggregated or separated into components. 
4.50 If an entity transfers part of an asset or part of a liability, the unit of account may change at that time, so 
that the transferred component and the retained component become separate units of account (see 
paragraphs 5.26–5.33). 
4.51 A unit of account is selected to provide useful information, which implies that: 
(a) the information provided about the asset or liability and about any related income and expenses 
must be relevant. Treating a group of rights and obligatio ns as a single unit of account may 
provide more relevant information than treating each right or obligation as a separate unit of 
account if, for example, those rights and obligations: 
(i) cannot be or are unlikely to be the subject of separate transactions; 
(ii) cannot or are unlikely to expire in different patterns; 
(iii) have similar economic characteristics and risks and hence are likely to have similar 
implications for the prospects for future net cash inflows to the entity or net cash outflows 
from the entity; or

(iv) are used together in the business activities conducted by an entity to produce cash flows
and are measured by reference to estimates of their interdependent future cash flows.
(b) the information provided about the asset or liability and about any related income and expenses
must faithfully represent the substance of the transaction or other event from which they have
arisen. Therefore, it may be necessary to treat rights or obligations arising from different sources
as a single unit of account, or to separate the rights or obligations arising from a single source
(see paragraph 4.62). Equally, to provide a faithful representation of unrelated rights and
obligations, it may be necessary to recognise and measure them separately.
4.52 Just as cost constrains other financial reporting decisions, it also constrains the selection of a unit of 
account. Hence, in selecting a unit of account, it is important to consider whether the benefits of the 
information provided to users of financial statements by selecting that unit of account are likely to justify 
the costs of providing and using that information. In general, the costs associated with recognising and 
measuring assets, liabilities, income and expenses increase as the size of the unit of account decreases. 
Hence, in general, rights or obligations arising from the same source are separated only if the resulting 
information is more useful and the benefits outweigh the costs. 
4.53 Sometimes, both rights and obligations arise from the same source. For example, some contracts 
establish both rights and obligations for each of the parties. If those rights and obligations are 
interdependent and cannot be separated, they constitute a single inseparable asset or liability and hence 
form a single unit of account. For example, this is the case with executory contracts (see paragraph 
4.57). Conversely, if rights are separable from obligations, it may sometimes be appropriate to group 
the rights separately from the obligations, resulting in the identification of one or more separate assets 
and liabilities. In other cases, it may be more appropriate to group separable rights and obligations in a 
single unit of account treating them as a single asset or a single liability. 
4.54 Treating a set of rights and obligations as a single unit of account differs from offsetting assets and 
liabilities (see paragraph 7.10). 
4.55 Possible units of account include: 
(a) an individual right or individual obligation;
(b) all rights, all obligations, or all rights and all obligations, arising from a single source, for
example, a contract;
(c) a subgroup of those rights and/or obligations —for example, a subgroup of rights over an item of
property, plant and equipment for which the useful life and pattern of consumption differ from
those of the other rights over that item;
(d) a group of rights and/or obligations arising from a portfolio of similar items;
(e) a group of rights and/or obligations arising from a portfolio of dissimilar items —
for example, a
portfolio of assets and liabilities to be disposed of in a single transaction; and
(f) a risk exposure within a portfolio of items —if a portfolio of items is subject to a common risk,
some aspects of the accounting for that portfolio could focus on the aggregate exposure to that
risk within the portfolio.
Executory contracts 
4.56 An executory contract is a contract, or a portion of a contract, that is equally unperformed —neither 
party has fulfilled any of its obligations, or both parties have partially fulfilled their obligations to an 
equal extent. 

<!-- page 46 -->

46A I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
4.57 An executory contract establishes a combined right and obligation to exchange economic resources. The 
right and obligation are interdependent and cannot be separated. Hence, the combined right and 
obligation constitute a single asset or liability. The entity has an asset if the terms of the exchange are 
currently favourable; it has a liability if the terms of the exchange are currently unfavourable. Whether 
such an asset or liability is included in the financial statements depends on both the recognition criteria 
(see Chapter 5) and the measurement basis (see Chapter 6) selected for the asset or liability, including, 
if applicable, any test for whether the contract is onerous. 
4.58 To the extent that either party fulfils its obligati ons under the contract, the contract is no longer 
executory. If the reporting entity performs first under the contract, that performance is the event that 
changes the reporting entity’s right and obligation to exchange economic resources into a right to receive 
an economic resource. That right is an asset. If the other party performs first, that performance is the 
event that changes the reporting entity’s right and obligation to exchange economic resources into an 
obligation to transfer an economic resource. That obligation is a liability. 
Substance of contractual rights and contractual obligations 
4.59 The terms of a contract create rights and obligations for an entity that is a party to that contract. To 
represent those rights and obligations faithfully, f inancial statements report their substance (see 
paragraph 2.12). In some cases, the substance of the rights and obligations is clear from the legal form 
of the contract. In other cases, the terms of the contract or a group or series of contracts require analysis 
to identify the substance of the rights and obligations. 
4.60 All terms in a contract —whether explicit or implicit —are considered unless they have no substance. 
Implicit terms could include, for example, obligations imposed by statute, such as statu tory warranty 
obligations imposed on entities that enter into contracts to sell goods to customers. 
4.61 Terms that have no substance are disregarded. A term has no substance if it has no discernible effect on 
the economics of the contract. Terms that have no substance could include, for example: 
(a) terms that bind neither party; or 
(b) rights, including options, that the holder will not have the practical ability to exercise in any 
circumstances. 
4.62 A group or series of contracts may achieve or be designed to achieve an overall commercial effect. To 
report the substance of such contracts, it may be necessary to treat rights and obligations arising from 
that group or series of contracts as a single unit of account. For example, if the rights or obligation s in 
one contract merely nullify all the rights or obligations in another contract entered into at the same time 
with the same counterparty, the combined effect is that the two contracts create no rights or obligations. 
Conversely, if a single contract cre ates two or more sets of rights or obligations that could have been 
created through two or more separate contracts, an entity may need to account for each set as if it arose 
from separate contracts in order to faithfully represent the rights and obligations (see paragraphs 4.48–
4.55). 
Definition of equity 
4.63 Equity is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities. 
4.64 Equity claims are claims on the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its 
liabilities. In other words, they are claims against the entity that do not meet the definition of a liability. 
Such claims may be established by contract, legislation or similar means, and include, to the extent that 
they do not meet the definition of a liability: 
(a) shares of various types, issued by the entity; and 
(b) some obligations of the entity to issue another equity claim.

4.65 Different classes of equity claims, such as ordinary shares and preference shares, may confer on their 
holders different rights, for example, rights to receive some or all of the following from the entity: 
(a) dividends, if the entity decides to pay dividends to eligible holders; 
(b) the proceeds from satisfying the equity claims, either in full on liquidation, or in pa rt at other 
times; or 
(c) other equity claims. 
4.66 Sometimes, legal, regulatory or other requirements affect particular components of equity, such as share 
capital or retained earnings. For example, some such requirements permit an entity to make distributions 
to holders of equity claims only if the entity has sufficient reserves that those requirements specify as 
being distributable. 
4.67 Business activities are often undertaken by entities such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, trusts or 
various types of government business undertakings. The legal and regulatory frameworks for such 
entities are often different from frameworks that apply to corporate entities. For example, there may be 
few, if any, restrictions on the distribution to holders of equity claims against such entities. Nevertheless, 
the definition of equity in paragraph 4.63 of the Conceptual Framework applies to all reporting entities. 
 
Definitions of income and expenses 
4.68 Income is increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in equity, other than those 
relating to contributions from holders of equity claims. 
4.69 Expenses are decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in decreases in equity, other than 
those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims. 
4.70 It follows from these definitions of income and expenses that contributions from holders of equity claims 
are not income, and distributions to holders of equity claims are not expenses. 
4.71 Income and expenses are th e elements of financial statements that relate to an entity’s financial 
performance. Users of financial statements need information about both an entity’s financial position 
and its financial performance. Hence, although income and expenses are defined in terms of changes in 
assets and liabilities, information about income and expenses is just as important as information about 
assets and liabilities. 
4.72 Different transactions and other events generate income and expenses with different characteristics. 
Providing information separately about income and expenses with different characteristics can help 
users of financial statements to understand the entity’s financial performance (see paragraphs 7.14 –
7.19).

The recognition process 
5.1 Recognition is the process of capturing for inclusion in the statement of financial position or the 
statement(s) of financial performance an item that  meets the definition of one of the elements of 
financial statements—an asset, a liability, equity, income or expenses. Recognition involves depicting 
the item in one of those statements—either alone or in aggregation with other items—in words and by 
a monetary amount, and including that amount in one or more totals in that statement. The amount at 
which an asset, a liability or equity is recognised in the statement of financial position is referred to as 
its ‘carrying amount’. 
5.2 The statement of financia l position and statement(s) of financial performance depict an entity’s 
recognised assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses in structured summaries that are designed to 
make financial information comparable and understandable. An important feature of the structures of 
those summaries is that the amounts recognised in a statement are included in the totals and, if 
applicable, subtotals that link the items recognised in the statement. 
5.3 Recognition links the elements, the statement of financial posi tion and the statement(s) of financial 
performance as follows (see Diagram 5.1):  
(a) in the statement of financial position at the beginning and end of the reporting period, total assets 
minus total liabilities equal total equity; and 
(b) recognised changes in equity during the reporting period comprise:  
(i) income minus expenses recognised in the statement(s) of financial performance; plus 
(ii) contributions from holders of equity claims, minus distributions to holders of equity 
claims. 
5.4 The statements are linked because the recognition of one item (or a change in its carrying amount) 
requires the recognition or derecognition of one or more other items (or changes in the carrying amount 
of one or more other items). For example:  

<!-- page 49 -->

(a) the recognition of income occurs at the same time as:  
(i) the initial recognition of an asset, or an increase in the carrying amount of an asset; or 
(ii) the derecognition of a liability, or a decrease in the carrying amount of a liability. 
(b) the recognition of expenses occurs at the same time as:  
(i) the initial recognition of a liability, or an increase in the carrying amount of a liability; or 
(ii) the derecognition of an asset, or a decrease in the carrying amount of an asset. 
  
 
 Diagram 5.1: How recognition links the elements of financial statements 
 
 
 
5.5 The initial recognition of assets or liabilities arising from transactions or other events may result in the 
simultaneous recognition of both income and related expenses. For example, the sale of goods for cash 
results in the recognition of both income (from the recognition of one asset—the cash) and an expense 
(from the derecognition of another asset—the goods sold). The simultaneous recognition of income and 
related expenses is sometimes referred to as the matching of costs with income. Application of the  
concepts in the Conceptual Framework leads to such matching when it arises from the recognition of 
Contributions from holders of equity claims minus distributions to 
holders of equity claims

changes in assets and liabilities. However, matching of costs with income is not an objective of the 
Conceptual Framework. The Conceptual Framework does not allow the recognition in the statement of 
financial position of items that do not meet the definition of an asset, a liability or equity. 
Recognition criteria 
5.6 Only items that meet the definition of an asset, a liability or equity are recognised in the  statement of 
financial position. Similarly, only items that meet the definition of income or expenses are recognised 
in the statement(s) of financial performance. However, not all items that meet the definition of one of 
those elements are recognised. 
5.7 Not recognising an item that meets the definition of one of the elements makes the statement of financial 
position and the statement(s) of financial performance less complete and can exclude useful information 
from financial statements. On the other hand, in some circumstances, recognising some items that meet 
the definition of one of the elements would not provide useful information. An asset or liability is 
recognised only if recognition of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes 
in equity provides users of financial statements with information that is useful, ie with:  
(a) relevant information about the asset or liability and about any resulting income, expenses or 
changes in equity (see paragraphs 5.12–5.17); and 
(b) a faithful representation of the asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes 
in equity (see paragraphs 5.18–5.25). 
5.8 Just as cost constrains other financial reporting decisions, it also constrains recognition decisions. There 
is a cost to recognising an asset or liability. Preparers of financial statements incur costs in obtaining a 
relevant measure of an asset or liability. Users of financial statements also incur costs in analysing and 
interpreting the information provided. An asset or liability is recognised if the benefits of the information 
provided to users of financial statements by recognition are likely to justify the costs of providing and 
using that information. In some cases, the costs of recognition may outweigh its benefits. 
5.9 It is not possible to define precisely when recognition of an asset or liability will provide useful 
information to users of financial statements, at a cost that does not outweigh its benefits. What is useful 
to users depends on the item and the facts and circumstances. Consequently, judgement is required when 
deciding whether to recognise an item, and thus recognition requirements may need to vary between 
and within Standards. 
5.10 It is important when making decisions about recognition to consider the information that would be given 
if an asset or liability were not recognised. For example, if no asset is recognised when expenditure is 
incurred, an expense is recognised. Over time, recognising the expense may, in some cases, provide 
useful information, for example, information that enables users of financial statements to identify trends. 
5.11 Even if an item meeting the definition of an asset or liability is not recognised, an entity may need to 
provide information about that item in the notes. I t is important to consider how to make such 
information sufficiently visible to compensate for the item’s absence from the structured summary 
provided by the statement of financial position and, if applicable, the statement(s) of financial 
performance. 
Relevance 
5.12 Information about assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses is relevant to users of financial 
statements. However, recognition of a particular asset or liability and any resulting income, expenses or 
changes in equity may not always provide relevant information. That may be the case if, for example:  
(a) it is uncertain whether an asset or liability exists (see paragraph 5.14); or 

<!-- page 51 -->

(b) an asset or liability exists, but the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low 
(see paragraphs 5.15–5.17). 
5.13 The presence of one or both of the factors described in paragraph 5.12 does not lead automatically to a 
conclusion that the information provided by recognition lacks relevance. Moreover, factors other than 
those described in p aragraph 5.12 may also affect the conclusion. It may be a combination of factors 
and not any single factor that determines whether recognition provides relevant information. 
Existence uncertainty 
5.14 Paragraphs 4.13 and 4.35 discuss cases in which it is u ncertain whether an asset or liability exists. In 
some cases, that uncertainty, possibly combined with a low probability of inflows or outflows of 
economic benefits and an exceptionally wide range of possible outcomes, may mean that the recognition 
of an asset or liability, necessarily measured at a single amount, would not provide relevant information. 
Whether or not the asset or liability is recognised, explanatory information about the uncertainties 
associated with it may need to be provided in the financial statements. 
Low probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits 
5.15 An asset or liability can exist even if the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low 
(see paragraphs 4.15 and 4.38). 
5.16 If the probability of an inf low or outflow of economic benefits is low, the most relevant information 
about the asset or liability may be information about the magnitude of the possible inflows or outflows, 
their possible timing and the factors affecting the probability of their occu rrence. The typical location 
for such information is in the notes. 
5.17 Even if the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low, recognition of the asset or 
liability may provide relevant information beyond the information described in paragraph 5.16. Whether 
that is the case may depend on a variety of factors. For example:  
(a) if an asset is acquired or a liability is incurred in an exchange transaction on market terms, its 
cost generally reflects the probability of an inflow or outflo w of economic benefits. Thus, that 
cost may be relevant information, and is generally readily available. Furthermore, not recognising 
the asset or liability would result in the recognition of expenses or income at the time of the 
exchange, which might not be a faithful representation of the transaction (see paragraph 5.25(a)). 
(b) if an asset or liability arises from an event that is not an exchange transaction, recognition of the 
asset or liability typically results in recognition of income or expenses. If  there is only a low 
probability that the asset or liability will result in an inflow or outflow of economic benefits, users 
of financial statements might not regard the recognition of the asset and income, or the liability 
and expenses, as providing relevant information. 
Faithful representation 
5.18 Recognition of a particular asset or liability is appropriate if it provides not only relevant information, 
but also a faithful representation of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or  
changes in equity. Whether a faithful representation can be provided may be affected by the level of 
measurement uncertainty associated with the asset or liability or by other factors.

Measurement uncertainty 
5.19 For an asset or liability to be recognised, it must be measured. In many cases, such measures must be 
estimated and are therefore subject to measurement uncertainty. As noted in paragraph 2.19, the use of 
reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial informati on and does not 
undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are clearly and accurately described and 
explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty does not necessarily prevent such an estimate 
from providing useful information. 
5.20 In some cases, the level of uncertainty involved in estimating a measure of an asset or liability may be 
so high that it may be questionable whether the estimate would provide a sufficiently faithful 
representation of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity. The 
level of measurement uncertainty may be so high if, for example, the only way of estimating that 
measure of the asset or liability is by using cash -flow-based measurement techniques and, in addition, 
one or more of the following circumstances exists:  
(a) the range of possible outcomes is exceptionally wide and the probability of each outcome is 
exceptionally difficult to estimate. 
(b) the measure is exceptionally sensitive to small changes in estimates of the probability of different 
outcomes—for example, if the probability of future cash inflows or outflows occurring is 
exceptionally low, but the magnitude of those cash inflows or outflows will be exceptionally high 
if they occur. 
(c) measuring the asse t or liability requires exceptionally difficult or exceptionally subjective 
allocations of cash flows that do not relate solely to the asset or liability being measured. 
5.21 In some of the cases described in paragraph 5.20, the most useful information may be the measure that 
relies on the highly uncertain estimate, accompanied by a description of the estimate and an explanation 
of the uncertainties that affect it. This is especially likely to be the case if that measure is the most 
relevant measure of the asset or liability. In other cases, if that information would not provide a 
sufficiently faithful representation of the asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or 
changes in equity, the most useful information may be a different measure (a ccompanied by any 
necessary descriptions and explanations) that is slightly less relevant but is subject to lower 
measurement uncertainty. 
5.22 In limited circumstances, all relevant measures of an asset or liability that are available (or can be 
obtained) may be subject to such high measurement uncertainty that none would provide useful 
information about the asset or liability (and any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity), even 
if the measure were accompanied by a description of the estimates m ade in producing it and an 
explanation of the uncertainties that affect those estimates. In those limited circumstances, the asset or 
liability would not be recognised. 
5.23 Whether or not an asset or liability is recognised, a faithful representation of t he asset or liability may 
need to include explanatory information about the uncertainties associated with the asset or liability’s 
existence or measurement, or with its outcome —the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of 
economic benefits that will ultimately result from it (see paragraphs 6.60–6.62). 
Other factors 
5.24 Faithful representation of a recognised asset, liability, equity, income or expenses involves not only 
recognition of that item, but also its measurement as well as presentation and disclosure of information 
about it (see Chapters 6–7).

5.25 Hence, when assessing whether the recognition of an asset or liability can provide a faithful 
representation of the asset or liability, it is necessary to consider not merely its description and 
measurement in the statement of financial position, but also:  
(a) the depiction of resulting income, expenses and changes in equity. For example, if an entity 
acquires an asset in exchange for consideration, not recognising the asset would result in 
recognising expenses and would reduce the entity’s profit and equity. In some cases, for example, 
if the entity does not consume the asset immediately, that result could provide a misleading 
representation that the entity’s financial position has deteriorated. 
(b) whether related assets and liabilities are recognised. If they are not recognised, recognition may 
create a recognition inconsistency (accounting mismatch). That may not provide an 
understandable or faithful representation of the overall effect of the tran saction or other event 
giving rise to the asset or liability, even if explanatory information is provided in the notes. 
(c) presentation and disclosure of information about the asset or liability, and resulting income, 
expenses or changes in equity. A complete depiction includes all information necessary for a user 
of financial statements to understand the economic phenomenon depicted, including all necessary 
descriptions and explanations. Hence, presentation and disclosure of related information can 
enable a recognised amount to form part of a faithful representation of an asset, a liability, equity, 
income or expenses. 
Derecognition 
5.26 Derecognition is the removal of all or part of a recognised asset or liability from an entity’s statement 
of financial position. Derecognition normally occurs when that item no longer meets the definition of 
an asset or of a liability:  
(a) for an asset, derecognition normally occurs when the entity loses control of all or part of the 
recognised asset; and 
(b) for a liability, derecognition normally occurs when the entity no longer has a present obligation 
for all or part of the recognised liability. 
5.27 Accounting requirements for derecognition aim to faithfully represent both:  
(a) any assets and liabilities retained after the transaction or other event that led to the derecognition 
(including any asset or liability acquired, incurred or created as part of the transaction or other 
event); and 
(b) the change in the entity’s assets and liabilities as a result of that transaction or other event. 
5.28 The aims described in paragraph 5.27 are normally achieved by:  
(a) derecognising any assets or liabilities that have expired or have been consumed, collected, 
fulfilled or transferred, and recognising any resulting income and  expenses. In the rest of this 
chapter, the term ‘transferred component’ refers to all those assets and liabilities; 
(b) continuing to recognise the assets or liabilities retained, referred to as the ‘retained component’, 
if any. That retained component be comes a unit of account separate from the transferred 
component. Accordingly, no income or expenses are recognised on the retained component as a 
result of the derecognition of the transferred component, unless the derecognition results in a 
change in the measurement requirements applicable to the retained component; and 
(c) applying one or more of the following procedures, if that is necessary to achieve one or both of 
the aims described in paragraph 5.27:

(i) presenting any retained component separately in the statement of financial position; 
(ii) presenting separately in the statement(s) of financial performance any income and 
expenses recognised as a result of the derecognition of the transferred component; or 
(iii) providing explanatory information. 
5.29 In some cases, an entity might appear to transfer an asset or liability, but that asset or liability might 
nevertheless remain an asset or liability of the entity. For example:  
(a) if an entity has apparently transferred an asset but retains exposure t o significant positive or 
negative variations in the amount of economic benefits that may be produced by the asset, this 
sometimes indicates that the entity might continue to control that asset (see paragraph 4.24); or 
(b) if an entity has transferred an asset to another party that holds the asset as an agent for the entity, 
the transferor still controls the asset (see paragraph 4.25). 
5.30 In the cases described in paragraph 5.29, derecognition of that asset or liability is not appropriate 
because it would not achieve either of the two aims described in paragraph 5.27. 
5.31 When an entity no longer has a transferred component, derecognition of the transferred component 
faithfully represents that fact. However, in some of those cases, derecognition may not f aithfully 
represent how much a transaction or other event changed the entity’s assets or liabilities, even when 
supported by one or more of the procedures described in paragraph 5.28(c). In those cases, derecognition 
of the transferred component might impl y that the entity’s financial position has changed more 
significantly than it has. This might occur, for example:  
(a) if an entity has transferred an asset and, at the same time, entered into another transaction that 
results in a present right or present obligation to reacquire the asset. Such present rights or present 
obligations may arise from, for example, a forward contract, a written put option, or a purchased 
call option. 
(b) if an entity has retained exposure to significant positive or negative vari ations in the amount of 
economic benefits that may be produced by a transferred component that the entity no longer 
controls. 
5.32 If derecognition is not sufficient to achieve both aims described in paragraph 5.27, even when supported 
by one or more of th e procedures described in paragraph 5.28(c), those two aims might sometimes be 
achieved by continuing to recognise the transferred component. This has the following consequences:  
(a) no income or expenses are recognised on either the retained component or  the transferred 
component as a result of the transaction or other event; 
(b) the proceeds received (or paid) upon transfer of the asset (or liability) are treated as a loan 
received (or given); and 
(c) separate presentation of the transferred component in  the statement of financial position, or 
provision of explanatory information, is needed to depict the fact that the entity no longer has 
any rights or obligations arising from the transferred component. Similarly, it may be necessary 
to provide information about income or expenses arising from the transferred component after 
the transfer. 
5.33 One case in which questions about derecognition arise is when a contract is modified in a way that 
reduces or eliminates existing rights or obligations. In deciding how to account for contract 
modifications, it is necessary to consider which unit of account provides users of financial statements 
with the most useful information about the assets and liabilities retained after the modification, and 
about how the modification changed the entity’s assets and liabilities:  
(a) if a contract modification only eliminates existing rights or obligations, the discussion in 
paragraphs 5.26 –5.32 is considered in deciding whether to derecognise those rights or 
obligations;

(b) if a contract modification only adds new rights or obligations, it is necessary to decide whether 
to treat the added rights or obligations as a separate asset or liability, or as part of the same unit 
of account as the existing rights and obligations (see paragraphs 4.48–4.55); and 
(c) if a contract modification both eliminates existing rights or obligations and adds new rights or 
obligations, it is necessary to consider both the separate and the combined effect of those 
modifications. In some such cases, the c ontract has been modified to such an extent that, in 
substance, the modification replaces the old asset or liability with a new asset or liability. In cases 
of such extensive modification, the entity may need to derecognise the original asset or liability, 
and recognise the new asset or liability.

Introduction 
6.1 Elements recognised in financial statements are quantified in monetary terms. This requires the selection 
of a measurement basis. A measurement basis is an identified feature—for example, historical cost, fair 
value or fulfilment value —of an item being measured. Applying a measurement basis to an asset or 
liability creates a measure for that asset or liability and for related income and expenses. 
6.2 Consideration of the qualitative characteristics of useful financial information and of the cost constraint 
is likely to result in the selection of different measurement bases for different assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. 
6.3 A Standard may need to describe how to implement the measurement basis selected in that Standard. 
That description could include:  
(a) specifying techniques that may or must be used to esti mate a measure applying a particular 
measurement basis; 
(b) specifying a simplified measurement approach that is likely to provide information similar to that 
provided by a preferred measurement basis; or 
(c) explaining how to modify a measurement basis, f or example, by excluding from the fulfilment 
value of a liability the effect of the possibility that the entity may fail to fulfil that liability (own 
credit risk). 
Measurement bases 
Historical cost 
6.4 Historical cost measures provide monetary information about assets, liabilities and related income and 
expenses, using information derived, at least in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that 
gave rise to them. Unlike current value, historical cost does not reflect changes in values, except to the 
extent that those changes relate to impairment of an asset or a liability becoming onerous (see paragraphs 
6.7(c) and 6.8(b)). 
6.5 The historical cost of an asset when it is acquired or created is the value of the costs incurred in acquiring 
or creating the asset, comprising the consideration paid to acquire or create the asset plus transaction 
costs. The historical cost of a liability when it is incurred or taken on is the value of the consideration 
received to incur or take on the liability minus transaction costs. 
6.6 When an asset is acquired or created, or a liability is incurred or taken on, as a result of an event that is 
not a transaction on market terms (see paragraph 6.80), it may not be possible to identify a cost, or the 
cost may not pr ovide relevant information about the asset or liability. In some such cases, a current 
value of the asset or liability is used as a deemed cost on initial recognition and that deemed cost is then 
used as a starting point for subsequent measurement at historical cost. 
6.7 The historical cost of an asset is updated over time to depict, if applicable:  
(a) the consumption of part or all of the economic resource that constitutes the asset (depreciation or 
amortisation); 

<!-- page 57 -->

 I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 57A 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
(b) payments received that extinguish part or all of the asset; 
(c) the effect of events that cause part or all of the historical cost of the asset to be no longer 
recoverable (impairment); and 
(d) accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the asset. 
 
6.8 The historical cost of a liability is updated over time to depict, if applicable:  
(a) fulfilment of part or all of the liability, for example, by making payments that extinguish part or 
all of the liability or by satisfying an obligation to deliver goods; 
(b) the effect of events  that increase the value of the obligation to transfer the economic resources 
needed to fulfil the liability to such an extent that the liability becomes onerous. A liability is 
onerous if the historical cost is no longer sufficient to depict the obligation to fulfil the liability; 
and 
(c) accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the liability. 
6.9 One way to apply a historical cost measurement basis to financial assets and financial liabilities is to 
measure them at amortised cost. The amo rtised cost of a financial asset or financial liability reflects 
estimates of future cash flows, discounted at a rate determined at initial recognition. For variable rate 
instruments, the discount rate is updated to reflect changes in the variable rate. The amortised cost of a 
financial asset or financial liability is updated over time to depict subsequent changes, such as the 
accrual of interest, the impairment of a financial asset and receipts or payments. 
Current value 
6.10 Current value measures provide monetary information about assets, liabilities and related income and 
expenses, using information updated to reflect conditions at the measurement date. Because of the 
updating, current values of assets and liabilities reflect changes, since the previous measurement date, 
in estimates of cash flows and other factors reflected in those current values (see paragraphs 6.14–6.15 
and 6.20). Unlike historical cost, the current value of an asset or liability is not derived, even in part, 
from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to the asset or liability. 
6.11 Current value measurement bases include:  
(a) fair value (see paragraphs 6.12–6.16); 
(b) value in use for assets and fulfilment value for liabilities (see paragraphs 6.17–6.20); and 
(c) current cost (see paragraphs 6.21–6.22). 
Fair value 
6.12 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
6.13 Fair value reflects the perspective of market participants —participants in a market to which the entity 
has access. The asset or liability is measured using the same assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability if those market participants act in their economic best interest. 
6.14 In some cases, fair value can be determined directly by observing prices in an active market. In other 
cases, it is determined indirectly using measurement techniques, for example, cash -flow-based 
measurement techniques (see paragraphs 6.91–6.95), reflecting all the following factors:  
(a) estimates of future cash flows. 

<!-- page 58 -->

58A I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
(b) possible variations in the estimated amount or timing of future cash flows for the asset or liability 
being measured, caused by the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows. 
(c) the time value of money. 
(d) the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the cash flows (a risk premium or risk discount). 
The price for bearing that uncertainty depends on the extent of that uncertainty. It als o reflects 
the fact that investors would generally pay less for an asset (and generally require more for taking 
on a liability) that has uncertain cash flows than for an asset (or liability) whose cash flows are 
certain. 
(e) other factors, for example, liquidity, if market participants would take those factors into account 
in the circumstances. 
6.15 The factors mentioned in paragraphs 6.14(b) and 6.14(d) include the possibility that a counterparty may 
fail to fulfil its liability to the entity (credit risk) , or that the entity may fail to fulfil its liability (own 
credit risk). 
6.16 Because fair value is not derived, even in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave 
rise to the asset or liability, fair value is not increased by the transaction costs incurred when acquiring 
the asset and is not decreased by the transaction costs incurred when the liability is incurred or taken 
on. In addition, fair value does not reflect the transaction costs that would be incurred on the ultimate 
disposal of the asset or on transferring or settling the liability. 
Value in use and fulfilment value 
6.17 Value in use is the present value of the cash flows, or other economic benefits, that an entity expects to 
derive from the use of an asset and from its ultimate disposal. Fulfilment value is the present value of 
the cash, or other economic resources, that an entity expects to be obliged to transfer as it fulfils a 
liability. Those amounts of cash or other economic resources include not only the amounts to  be 
transferred to the liability counterparty, but also the amounts that the entity expects to be obliged to 
transfer to other parties to enable it to fulfil the liability. 
6.18 Because value in use and fulfilment value are based on future cash flows, they do not include transaction 
costs incurred on acquiring an asset or taking on a liability. However, value in use and fulfilment value 
include the present value of any transaction costs an entity expects to incur on the ultimate disposal of 
the asset or on fulfilling the liability. 
6.19 Value in use and fulfilment value reflect entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions by market 
participants. In practice, there may sometimes be little difference between the assumptions that market 
participants would use and those that an entity itself uses. 
6.20 Value in use and fulfilment value cannot be observed directly and are determined using cash-flow-based 
measurement techniques (see paragraphs 6.91–6.95). Value in use and fulfilment value reflect the same 
factors described for fair value in paragraph 6.14, but from an entity -specific perspective rather than 
from a market-participant perspective. 
Current cost 
6.21 The current cost of an asset is the cost of an equivalent asset at the measurement date, comprisi ng the 
consideration that would be paid at the measurement date plus the transaction costs that would be 
incurred at that date. The current cost of a liability is the consideration that would be received for an 
equivalent liability at the measurement date minus the transaction costs that would be incurred at that 
date. Current cost, like historical cost, is an entry value: it reflects prices in the market in which the 
entity would acquire the asset or would incur the liability. Hence, it is different from f air value, value 
in use and fulfilment value, which are exit values. However, unlike historical cost, current cost reflects 
conditions at the measurement date.

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
6.22 In some cases, current cost cannot be determined directly by observing prices in an active market and 
must be determined indirectly by other means. For example, if prices are available only for new assets, 
the current cost of a used asset might need to be estimated by adjusting the current price of a new asset 
to reflect the current age and condition of the asset held by the entity. 
Information provided by particular measurement bases 
6.23 When selecting a measurement basis, it is important to consider the nature of the information that the 
measurement basis will produce in both the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of 
financial performance. Table 6.1 summarises that information and paragraphs 6.24 –6.42 provide 
additional discussion. 
Historical cost 
6.24 Information provided by measuring an asset or liability at historical cost may be relevant to users of 
financial statements, because historical cost uses information derived, at least in part, from the price of 
the transaction or other event that gave rise to the asset or liability. 
6.25 Normally, if an entity acquired an asset in a recent transaction on market terms, the entity expects that 
the asset will provide sufficient economic benefits that the entity will at least recover the cost of the 
asset. Similarly, if a liability was incurred or taken on as a result of a recent transaction on market terms, 
the entity expects that the value of the obligation to transfer economic resources to fulfil the liability 
will normally be no more than the value of the consideration received minus transaction costs. Hence, 
measuring an asset or liability at historical cost in such cases provides relevant information about both 
the asset or liability and the price of the transaction that gave rise to that asset or liability. 
6.26 Because historical cost is reduced to reflect consumption of an asse t and its impairment, the amount 
expected to be recovered from an asset measured at historical cost is at least as great as its carrying 
amount. Similarly, because the historical cost of a liability is increased when it becomes onerous, the 
value of the obligation to transfer the economic resources needed to fulfil the liability is no more than 
the carrying amount of the liability. 
6.27 If an asset other than a financial asset is measured at historical cost, consumption or sale of the asset, or 
of part of the asset, gives rise to an expense measured at the historical cost of the asset, or of part of the 
asset, consumed or sold. 
6.28 The expense arising from the sale of an asset is recognised at the same time as the consideration for that 
sale is recognised as income. The difference between the income and the expense is the margin resulting 
from the sale. Expenses arising from consumption of an asset can be compared to related income to 
provide information about margins. 
6.29 Similarly, if a liability other th an a financial liability was incurred or taken on in exchange for 
consideration and is measured at historical cost, the fulfilment of all or part of the liability gives rise to 
income measured at the value of the consideration received for the part fulfilled. The difference between 
that income and the expenses incurred in fulfilling the liability is the margin resulting from the 
fulfilment. 
6.30 Information about the cost of assets sold or consumed, including goods and services consumed 
immediately (see paragraph 4.8), and about the consideration received, may have predictive value. That 
information can be used as an input in predicting future margins from the future sale of goods (including 
goods not currently held by the entity) and services and hence to assess the entity’s prospects for future 
net cash inflows. To assess an entity’s prospects for future cash flows, users of financial statements 
often focus on the entity’s prospects for generating future margins over many periods, not just on its 
prospects for generating margins from goods already held. Income and expenses measured at historical

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
cost may also have confirmatory value because they may provide feedback to users of financial 
statements about their previous predictions of cash flows or of margins . Information about the cost of 
assets sold or consumed may also help in an assessment of how efficiently and effectively the entity’s 
management has discharged its responsibilities to use the entity’s economic resources. 
6.31 For similar reasons, informat ion about interest earned on assets, and interest incurred on liabilities, 
measured at amortised cost may have predictive and confirmatory value. 
Current value 
Fair value 
6.32 Information provided by measuring assets and liabilities at fair value may have predictive value because 
fair value reflects market participants’ current expectations about the amount, timing and uncertainty of 
future cash flows. These expectations are priced in a manner that reflects the current risk preferences of 
market participants. That information may also have confirmatory value by providing feedback about 
previous expectations. 
6.33 Income and expenses reflecting market participants’ current expectations may have some predictive 
value, because such income and expenses can be us ed as an input in predicting future income and 
expenses. Such income and expenses may also help in an assessment of how efficiently and effectively 
the entity’s management has discharged its responsibilities to use the entity’s economic resources. 
6.34 A change in the fair value of an asset or liability can result from various factors identified in paragraph 
6.14. When those factors have different characteristics, identifying separately income and expenses that 
result from those factors can provide useful information to users of financial statements (see paragraph 
7.14(b)). 
6.35 If an entity acquired an asset in one market and determines fair value using prices in a different market 
(the market in which the entity would sell the asset), any difference betwee n the prices in those two 
markets is recognised as income when that fair value is first determined. 
6.36 Sale of an asset or transfer of a liability would normally be for consideration of an amount similar to its 
fair value, if the transaction were to occu r in the market that was the source for the prices used when 
measuring that fair value. In those cases, if the asset or liability is measured at fair value, the net income 
or net expenses arising at the time of the sale or transfer would usually be small, unless the effect of 
transaction costs is significant. 
Value in use and fulfilment value 
6.37 Value in use provides information about the present value of the estimated cash flows from the use of 
an asset and from its ultimate disposal. This information ma y have predictive value because it can be 
used in assessing the prospects for future net cash inflows. 
6.38 Fulfilment value provides information about the present value of the estimated cash flows needed to 
fulfil a liability. Hence, fulfilment value may have predictive value, particularly if the liability will be 
fulfilled, rather than transferred or settled by negotiation. 
6.39 Updated estimates of value in use or fulfilment value, combined with information about estimates of the 
amount, timing and uncer tainty of future cash flows, may also have confirmatory value because they 
provide feedback about previous estimates of value in use or fulfilment value. 
Current cost 
6.40 Information about assets and liabilities measured at current cost may be relevant be cause current cost 
reflects the cost at which an equivalent asset could be acquired or created at the measurement date or 
the consideration that would be received for incurring or taking on an equivalent liability.

6.41 Like historical cost, current cost p rovides information about the cost of an asset consumed or about 
income from the fulfilment of liabilities. That information can be used to derive current margins and 
can be used as an input in predicting future margins. Unlike historical cost, current cos t reflects prices 
prevailing at the time of consumption or fulfilment. When price changes are significant, margins based 
on current cost may be more useful for predicting future margins than margins based on historical cost. 
6.42 To report the current cost  of consumption (or current income from fulfilment), it is necessary to split 
the change in the carrying amount in the reporting period into the current cost of consumption (or current 
income from fulfilment), and the effect of changes in prices. The effec t of a change in prices is 
sometimes referred to as a ‘holding gain’ or a ‘holding loss’.

Factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis 
6.43 In selecting a measurement basis for an asset or liability and for the  related income and expenses, it is 
necessary to consider the nature of the information that the measurement basis will produce in both the 
statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance (see paragraphs 6.23–6.42 
and Table 6.1), as well as other factors (see paragraphs 6.44–6.86). 
6.44 In most cases, no single factor will determine which measurement basis should be selected. The relative 
importance of each factor will depend on facts and circumstances. 
6.45 The information provided by a measurement basis must be useful to users of financial statements. To 
achieve this, the information must be relevant and it must faithfully represent what it purports to 
represent. In addition, the information provided should be, as far as possi ble, comparable, verifiable, 
timely and understandable. 
6.46 As explained in paragraph 2.21, the most efficient and effective process for applying the fundamental 
qualitative characteristics would usually be to identify the most relevant information about an economic 
phenomenon. If that information is not available or cannot be provided in a way that faithfully represents 
the economic phenomenon, the next most relevant type of information is considered. Paragraphs 6.49–
6.76 provide further discussion of the role played by the qualitative characteristics in the selection of a 
measurement basis. 
6.47 The discussion in paragraphs 6.49 –6.76 focuses on the factors to be considered in selecting a 
measurement basis for recognised assets and recognised liabilities. Some of that discussion may also 
apply in selecting a measurement basis for information provided in the notes, for recognised or 
unrecognised items. 
6.48 Paragraphs 6.77–6.82 discuss additional factors to consider in selecting a measurement basis on initia l 
recognition. If the initial measurement basis is inconsistent with the subsequent measurement basis, 
income and expenses might be recognised at the time of the first subsequent measurement solely because 
of the change in measurement basis. Recognising su ch income and expenses might appear to depict a 
transaction or other event when, in fact, no such transaction or event has occurred. Hence, the choice of 

<!-- page 67 -->

 I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 67A 
      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
   
measurement basis for an asset or liability, and for the related income and expenses, is determined by  
considering both initial measurement and subsequent measurement. 
Relevance 
6.49 The relevance of information provided by a measurement basis for an asset or liability and for the related 
income and expenses is affected by:  
(a) the characteristics of the asset or liability (see paragraphs 6.50–6.53); and 
(b) how that asset or liability contributes to future cash flows (see paragraphs 6.54–6.57). 
Characteristics of the asset or liability 
6.50 The relevance of information provided by a measurement basis depends partly on the characteristics of 
the asset or liability, in particular, on the variability of cash flows and on whether the value of the asset 
or liability is sensitive to market factors or other risks. 
6.51 If the value of an asset or liability is  sensitive to market factors or other risks, its historical cost might 
differ significantly from its current value. Consequently, historical cost may not provide relevant 
information if information about changes in value is important to users of financial statements. For 
example, amortised cost cannot provide relevant information about a financial asset or financial liability 
that is a derivative. 
6.52 Furthermore, if historical cost is used, changes in value are reported not when that value changes, but 
when an event such as disposal, impairment or fulfilment occurs. This could be incorrectly interpreted 
as implying that all the income and expenses recognised at the time of that event arose then, rather than 
over the periods during which the asset or liabil ity was held. Moreover, because measurement at 
historical cost does not provide timely information about changes in value, income and expenses 
reported on that basis may lack predictive value and confirmatory value by not depicting the full effect 
of the entity’s exposure to risk arising from holding the asset or liability during the reporting period. 
6.53 Changes in the fair value of an asset or liability reflect changes in expectations of market participants 
and changes in their risk preferences. Dependin g on the characteristics of the asset or liability being 
measured and on the nature of the entity’s business activities, information reflecting those changes may 
not always provide predictive value or confirmatory value to users of financial statements. This may be 
the case when the entity’s business activities do not involve selling the asset or transferring the liability, 
for example, if the entity holds assets solely for use or solely for collecting contractual cash flows or if 
the entity is to fulfil liabilities itself. 
Contribution to future cash flows 
6.54 As noted in paragraph 1.14, some economic resources produce cash flows directly; in other cases, 
economic resources are used in combination to produce cash flows indirectly. How economic resources 
are used, and hence how assets and liabilities produce cash flows, depends in part on the nature of the 
business activities conducted by the entity. 
6.55 When a business activity of an entity involves the use of several economic resources that produce cash 
flows indirectly, by being used in combination to produce and market goods or services to customers, 
historical cost or current cost is likely to provide relevant information about that activity. For example, 
property, plant and equipment is typically used in combination with an entity’s other economic 
resources. Similarly, inventory typically cannot be sold to a customer, except by making extensive use 
of the entity’s other economic resources (for example, in production and marketing activities). 
Paragraphs 6.24–6.31 and 6.40–6.42 explain how measuring such assets at historical cost or current cost 
can provide relevant information that can be used to derive margins achieved during the period. 

<!-- page 68 -->

      PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020  
 
6.56 For assets and liabilities that produce cash flows directly, such as assets that can be sold independently 
and without a significant economic penalty (for example, without significant business disruption), the 
measurement basis that provides the most relevant information is likely to be a current value that 
incorporates current estimates of the amount, timing and uncertainty of the future cash flows. 
6.57 When a business activity of an entity involves managing financial assets and financial liabilities with 
the objective of collecting contractual cash flows, amortised cost may provide relevant information that 
can be used to derive the margin between the interest earned on the assets and the interest incurred on 
the liabilities. However, in assessing whether amortised cost will provide useful information, it is also 
necessary to consider the characteristics of the financial asset or financial liability. Amortised cost is 
unlikely to provide relevant information about cash flows that depend on factors other than principal 
and interest. 
Faithful representation 
 
6.58 When assets and liabilities are related in some way, using different measurement bases for those assets 
and liabilities can create a measurement inconsistency (accounting mismatch). If financial statements 
contain measurement inconsistencies, those financial s tatements may not faithfully represent some 
aspects of the entity’s financial position and financial performance. Consequently, in some 
circumstances, using the same measurement basis for related assets and liabilities may provide users of 
financial statements with information that is more useful than the information that would result from 
using different measurement bases. This may be particularly likely when the cash flows from one asset 
or liability are directly linked to the cash flows from another asset or liability. 
 
6.59 As noted in paragraphs 2.13 and 2.18, although a perfectly faithful representation is free from error, this 
does not mean that measures must be perfectly accurate in all respects. 
 
6.60 When a measure cannot be determined directly by observing prices in an active market and must instead 
be estimated, measurement uncertainty arises. The level of measurement uncertainty associated with a 
particular measurement basis may affect whether information provided by that measurement basis 
provides a faithful representation of an entity’s financial position and financial performance. A high 
level of measurement uncertainty does not necessarily prevent the use of a measurement basis that 
provides relevant information. However, in some cases the level of measurement uncertainty is so high 
that information provided by a measurement basis might not provide a sufficiently faithful 
representation (see paragraph 2.22). In such cases, it is appropriate to consider selecting a different 
measurement basis that would also result in relevant information. 
 
6.61 Measurement uncertainty is different from both outcome uncertainty and existence uncertainty:  
(a) outcome uncertainty arises when there is uncertainty about the amount or timing of any inflow 
or outflow of economic benefits that will result from an asset or liability. 
(b) existence uncertainty arises when it is uncertain whether an asset or a liability exists. Paragraphs 
5.12–5.14 discuss how existence uncertainty may affect decisions about whether an ent ity 
recognises an asset or liability when it is uncertain whether that asset or liability exists. 
6.62 The presence of outcome uncertainty or existence uncertainty may sometimes contribute to 
measurement uncertainty. However, outcome uncertainty or existence uncertainty does not necessarily 
result in measurement uncertainty. For example, if the fair value of an asset can be determined directly 
by observing prices in an active market, no measurement uncertainty is associated with the measurement 
of that fair value, even if it is uncertain how much cash the asset will ultimately produce and hence there 
is outcome uncertainty.

Enhancing qualitative characteristics and the cost constraint 
 
6.63 The enhancing qualitative characteristics of comparability, understa ndability and verifiability, and the 
cost constraint, have implications for the selection of a measurement basis. The following paragraphs 
discuss those implications. Paragraphs 6.69 –6.76 discuss further implications specific to particular 
measurement bases. The enhancing qualitative characteristic of timeliness has no specific implications 
for measurement. 
6.64 Just as cost constrains other financial reporting decisions, it also constrains the selection of a 
measurement basis. Hence, in selecting a measure ment basis, it is important to consider whether the 
benefits of the information provided to users of financial statements by that measurement basis are likely 
to justify the costs of providing and using that information. 
6.65 Consistently using the same measurement bases for the same items, either from period to period within 
a reporting entity or in a single period across entities, can help make financial statements more 
comparable. 
6.66 A change in measurement basis can make financial statements less understandable. However, a change 
may be justified if other factors outweigh the reduction in understandability, for example, if the change 
results in more relevant information. If a change is made, users of financial statements may need 
explanatory information to enable them to understand the effect of that change. 
6.67 Understandability depends partly on how many different measurement bases are used and on whether 
they change over time. In general, if more measurement bases are used in a set of financial statements, 
the resulting information becomes more complex and, hence, less understandable and the totals or 
subtotals in the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance become 
less informative. However, it could be appropriat e to use more measurement bases if that is necessary 
to provide useful information. 
6.68 Verifiability is enhanced by using measurement bases that result in measures that can be independently 
corroborated either directly, for example, by observing prices, or indirectly, for example, by checking 
inputs to a model. If a measure cannot be verified, users of financial statements may need explanatory 
information to enable them to understand how the measure was determined. In some such cases, it may 
be necessary to specify the use of a different measurement basis. 
Historical cost 
6.69 In many situations, it is simpler, and hence less costly, to measure historical cost than it is to measure a 
current value. In addition, measures determined applying a historical cos t measurement basis are 
generally well understood and, in many cases, verifiable. 
6.70 However, estimating consumption and identifying and measuring impairment losses or onerous 
liabilities can be subjective. Hence, the historical cost of an asset or liabi lity can sometimes be as 
difficult to measure or verify as a current value. 
6.71 Using a historical cost measurement basis, identical assets acquired, or liabilities incurred, at different 
times can be reported in the financial statements at different amou nts. This can reduce comparability, 
both from period to period for a reporting entity and in a single period across entities. 
Current value 
 
6.72 Because fair value is determined from the perspective of market participants, not from an entity-specific 
perspective, and is independent of when the asset was acquired or the liability was incurred, identical 
assets or liabilities measured at fair value will, in principle, be measured at the same amount by entities 

<!-- page 70 -->

70A I fldgi ( ^I& fcoh ‐› ,xld m%cd;dka;%sl iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2020'03'11 
PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020 
that have access to the same markets. This can enhance comparability both from period to period for a 
reporting entity and in a single period across entities. In contrast, because value in use and fulfilment 
value reflect an entity-specific perspective, those measures could differ for identical assets or liabilities 
in different entities. Those differences may reduce comparability, particularly if the assets or liabilities 
contribute to cash flows in a similar manner. 
6.73 If the fair value of an asset or liability can be determined directly by observing prices in an active market, 
the process of fair value measurement is low-cost, simple and easy to understand; and the fair value can 
be verified through direct observation. 
6.74 Valuation techniques, sometimes including the use of cash-flow-based measurement techniques, may 
be needed to estimate fair value when it cannot be observed directly in an active market and are generally 
needed when determining value in use and fulfilment value. Depending on the techniques used:  
(a) estimating inputs to the valuation and applying the valuation technique may be costly and
complex.
(b) the inputs into the process may be subjective and it may be difficult to verify both the inputs and
the validity of the process itself. Consequently, the measures of identical assets or liabilities may
differ. That would reduce comparability.
6.75 In many cases, value in use cannot be determined meaningfully for an individual asset used in 
combination with other assets. Instead, the value in use is determined for a group of assets and the result 
may then need to be allocated to individual assets. This process can be subjective and arbitrary. In 
addition, estimates of value in use for an asset may inadvertently reflect the effect of synergies with 
other assets in the group. Hence, determining the value in use of an asset used in combination with other 
assets can be a costly process and its complexity and subjectivity reduces verifiability. For these reasons, 
value in use may not be a practical measurement basis for regular remeasurements of such assets. 
However, it may be useful for occasional remeasurements of assets, for example, when it is used in an 
impairment test to determine whether historical cost is fully recoverable. 
6.76 Using a current cost measurement basis, identical assets acquired or liabilities incurred at different times 
are reported in the financial statements at the same amount. This can enhance comparability, both from 
period to period for a reporting entity and in a single period across entities. However, determining 
current cost can be complex, subjective and costly. For example, as noted in paragraph 6.22, it may be 
necessary to estimate the current cost of an asset by adjusting the current price of a new asset to reflect 
the current age and condition of the asset held by the entity. In addition, because of changes in 
technology and changes in business practices, many assets would not be replaced with identical assets. 
Thus, a further subjective adjustment to the current price of a new asset would be required in order to 
estimate the current cost of an asset equivalent to the existing asset. Also, splitting changes in current 
cost carrying amounts between the current cost of consumption and the effect of changes in prices (see 
paragraph 6.42) may be complex and require arbitrary assumptions. Because of these difficulties, 
current cost measures may lack verifiability and understandability. 
Factors specific to initial measurement 
6.77 Paragraphs 6.43 –6.76 discuss factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis, whether for initial 
recognition or subsequent measurement. Paragraphs 6.78 –6.82 discuss some additional factors to 
consider at initial recognition. 
6.78 At initial recognition, the cost of an asset acquired, or of a liability incurred, as a result of an event that 
is a transaction on market terms is normally similar to its fair value at that date, unless transaction costs 
are significant. Nevertheless, even if those two amounts are similar, it is necessary to describe what 
measurement basis is used at initial recognition. If historical cost will be used subsequently, that 
measurement basis is also normally appropriate at initial recognition. Similarly, if a current value will 
be used subsequently, it is also normally appropriate at initial recognition. Using the same measurement

basis for initial recognition and subsequent measurement avoids recognising income or expenses at the 
time of the first subsequ ent measurement solely because of a change in measurement basis (see 
paragraph 6.48). 
 
6.79 When an entity acquires an asset, or incurs a liability, in exchange for transferring another asset or 
liability as a result of a transaction on market terms, the i nitial measure of the asset acquired, or the 
liability incurred, determines whether any income or expenses arise from the transaction. When an asset 
or liability is measured at cost, no income or expenses arise at initial recognition, unless income or 
expenses arise from the derecognition of the transferred asset or liability, or unless the asset is impaired 
or the liability is onerous. 
 
6.80 Assets may be acquired, or liabilities may be incurred, as a result of an event that is not a transaction on 
market terms. For example:  
(a) the transaction price may be affected by relationships between the parties, or by financial distress 
or other duress of one of the parties; 
(b) an asset may be granted to the entity free of charge by a government or donated to the entity by 
another party; 
(c) a liability may be imposed by legislation or regulation; or 
(d) a liability to pay compensation or a penalty may arise from an act of wrongdoing. 
 
6.81 In such cases, measuring the asset acquired, or the liability incurred, at its historical cost may not provide 
a faithful representation of the entity’s assets and liabilities and of any income or expenses arising from 
the transaction or other event. Hence, it may be appropriate to measure the asset acquired, or the liability 
incurred, at deemed cost, as described in paragraph 6.6. Any difference between that deemed cost and 
any consideration given or received would be recognised as income or expenses at initial recognition. 
 
6.82 When assets are acquired, or liabilities incurred, as a result of an event that is not a transaction on market 
terms, all relevant aspects of the transaction or other event need to be identi fied and considered. For 
example, it may be necessary to recognise other assets, other liabilities, contributions from holders of 
equity claims or distributions to holders of equity claims to faithfully represent the substance of the 
effect of the transaction or other event on the entity’s financial position (see paragraphs 4.59–4.62) and 
any related effect on the entity’s financial performance. 
More than one measurement basis 
6.83 Sometimes, consideration of the factors described in paragraphs 6.43 –6.76 may lead to the conclusion 
that more than one measurement basis is needed for an asset or liability and for related income and 
expenses in order to provide relevant information that faithfully represents both the entity’s financial 
position and its financial performance. 
6.84 In most cases, the most understandable way to provide that information is:  
(a) to use a single measurement basis both for the asset or liability in the statement of financial 
position and for related income and expenses in the statement(s) of financial performance; and 
(b) to provide in the notes additional information applying a different measurement basis. 
6.85 However, in some cases, that information is more relevant, or results in a more faithful representation 
of both the entity’s financial position and its financial performance, through the use of:  
(a) a current value measurement basis for the asset or liability in the statement of financial position; 
and

(b) a different measurement basis for the related income and expenses in the statement of profit or
loss10 (see paragraphs 7.17–7.18).
In selecting those measurement bases, it is necessary to consider the factors discussed in paragraphs 
6.43–6.76. 
6.86 In such cases, the total income or total expenses arising in the period from the change in the current 
value of the asset or liability is separated and classified (see paragraphs 7.14–7.19) so that: 
(a) the statement of profit or loss includes the income or expenses measured applying the measurement
basis selected for that statement; and
(b) other comprehensive income includes all the remaining income or expenses. As a result, the
accumulated other comprehensive income related to that asset or liability equals the difference
between:
(i) the carrying amount of the asset or liability in the statement of financial position; and
(ii) the carrying amount that would have been determined applying the measurement basis selected
for the statement of profit or loss.
Measurement of equity 
6.87 The total carrying amount of equity (total equity) is not measured directly. It equals the total of the 
carrying amounts of all recognised assets less the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised 
liabilities. 
6.88 Becaus e general purpose financial statements are not designed to show an entity’s value, the total 
carrying amount of equity will not generally equal: 
(a) the aggregate market value of equity claims on the entity;
(b) the amount that could be raised by selling the entity as a whole on a going concern basis; or
(c) the amount that could be raised by selling all of the entity’s assets and settling all of its liabilities.
6.89 Although total equity is not measured directly, it may be appropriate to measure directly the carrying 
amount of some individual classes of equity (see paragraph 4.65) and some components of equity (see 
paragraph 4.66). Nevertheless, because total equity is measured as a residual, at least one class of equity 
cannot be measured directly. Similarly, at least one component of equity cannot be measured directly. 
6.90 The total carrying amount of an individual class of equity or component of equity is normally positive, 
but can be negative in some circumstances. Similarly, total equity is generally positive, but it can be 
negative, depending on which assets and liabilities are recognised and on how they are measured. 
Cash-flow-based measurement techniques 
6.91 Sometimes, a measure cannot be observed directly. In some such cases, one way to estimate the measure 
is by using cash-flow-based measurement techniques. Such techniques are not measurement bases. They 
are techniques used in applying a measurement basis. Hence, when using such a technique, it is 
necessary to identify which measurement basis is used and the extent to which the technique reflects the 
factors applicable to that measurement basis. For example, if the measurement basis is fair value, the 
applicable factors are those described in paragraph 6.14. 
6.92 Cash-flow-based measurement techniques can be used in applying a modified measurement basis, for 
example, fulfilment value modified to exclude the effect of the possibility that the entity may fail to 
fulfil a liability (own credit risk). Modifying measurement bases may sometimes result in information 
10 The Conceptual Framework does not specify whether the statement(s) of financial performance comprise(s) a single statement 
or two statements. The Conceptual Framework uses the term ‘statement of profit or loss’ to refer both to a separate statement 
and to a separate section within a single statement of financial performance.

that is more relevant to the users of financial statements or that may be less costly to produce or to 
understand. However, modified measurement bases may also be more difficult for users of financial 
statements to understand. 
6.93 Outcome uncertainty (see paragraph 6.61(a)) arises from uncertainties about the amount or timing of 
future cash flows. Those uncertainties are important characteristics of assets and liabilities. When 
measuring an asset or liability by reference to estimates of uncertain future cash flows, one factor to 
consider is possible variations in the estimated amount or timing of those cash flows (see paragraph 
6.14(b)). Those variations are considered in selecting a single amount from within the range of possible 
cash flows. The amount selected is itself sometimes the amount of a possible outcome, but this is not 
always the case. The amount that provides the most relevant information is usually one from within the 
central part of the range (a central estimate). Different central estimates provide different information. 
For example:  
(a) the expected value (the probability- weighted average, also known as the statistical mean) reflects the
entire range of outcomes and gives more weight to the outcomes that are more likely. The expected
value is not intended to predict the ultimate inflow or outflow of cash or other economic benefits
arising from that asset or liability.
(b) the maximum amount that is more likely than not to occur (similar to the statistical median) indicates
that the probability of a subsequent loss is no more than 50% and that the probability of a subsequent
gain is no more than 50%.
(c) the most likely outcome (the statistical mode) is the single most likely ultimate inflow or outflow
arising from an asset or liability.
6.94 A central estimate depends on estimates of future cash flows and possible variations in their amounts or 
timing. It does not capture the price for bearing the uncertainty that the ultimate outcome may differ 
from that central estimate (that is, the factor described in paragraph 6.14(d)). 
6.95 No central estimate gives complete information about the range of possible outcomes. Hence users may 
need information about the range of possible outcomes.

Presentation and disclosure as communication tools 
7.1 A reporting entity communicates information about its assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses 
by presenting and disclosing information in its financial statements. 
7.2 Effective communication of information in financial statements makes that information more relevant 
and contributes to a faithful representation of an entity’s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. 
It also enhances the understandability and comparability of information in financial statements. 
Effective communication of information in financial statements requires: 
(a) focusing on presentation and disclosure objectives and principles rather than focusing on rules;
(b) classifying information in a manner that groups similar items and separates dissimilar items; and
(c) aggregating information in such a way that it is not obscured either by unnecessary detail or by
excessive aggregation.
7.3 Just as cost constrains other financial reporting decisions, it also constrains decisions about presentation 
and disclosure. Hence, in making decisions about presentation and disclosure, it is important to consider 
whether the benefits provided to users of financial statements by presenting or disclosing particular 
information are likely to justify the costs of providing and using that information. 
Presentation and disclosure objectives and principles 
7.4 To facilitate effective communication of information in financial statements, when developing 
presentation and disclosure requirements in Standards a balance is needed between: 
(a) giving entities the flexibility to provide relevant information that faithfully re presents the entity’s
assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses; and
(b) requiring information that is comparable, both from period to period for a reporting entity and in
a single reporting period across entities.
7.5 Including presentation and disclosure objectives in Standards supports effective communication in 
financial statements because such objectives help entities to identify useful information and to decide 
how to communicate that information in the most effective manner. 
7.6 Effective communication in financial statements is also supported by considering the following 
principles: 
(a) entity-specific information is more useful than standardised descriptions, sometimes referred to
as ‘boilerplate’; and
(b) duplication of information in different parts of the financial statements is usually unnecessary
and can make financial statements less understandable.
Classification 
7.7 Classification is the sorting of assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses on the basis of shared 
characteristics for presentation and disclosure purposes. Such characteristics include —but are not 
limited to—the nature of the item, its role (or function) within the business activities conducted by the 
entity, and how it is measured. 
7.8 Classifying dissimilar assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses together can obscure relevant 
information, reduce understandability and comparability and may not provide a faithful representation 
of what it purports to represent.

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020 
Classification of assets and liabilities 
7.9 Classification is applied to the unit of account selected for an asset or liability (see paragraphs 4.48 –
4.55). However, it may sometimes be appropriate to separate an asset or liability into components that 
have different characteristics and to classify those components separately. That would be appropriate 
when classifying those components separately would enhance the usefulness of the resulting financial 
information. For example, it could be appropriate to separate an asset or liability into current and non-
current components and to classify those components separately. 
Offsetting 
7.10 Offsetting occurs when an entity recognises and measures both an asset and liability as separate units 
of account, but groups them into a single net amount in the statement of financial position. Offsetting 
classifies dissimilar items together and therefore is generally not appropriate. 
7.11 Offsetting assets and liabilities differs from treating a set of rights and obligations as a single unit of 
account (see paragraphs 4.48–4.55). 
Classification of equity 
7.12 To provide useful information, it may be necessary to classify equity claims separately if those equity 
claims have different characteristics (see paragraph 4.65). 
7.13 Similarly, to provide useful information, it may be necessary to classify components of equity separately 
if some of those components are subject to particular legal, regulatory or other requirements. For 
example, in some jurisdictions, an entity is permitted to make distributions to holders of equity claims 
only if the entity has sufficient reserves specified as distributable (see paragraph 4.66). Separate 
presentation or disclosure of those reserves may provide useful information. 
Classification of income and expenses 
7.14 Classification is applied to: 
(a) income and expenses resulting from the unit of account selected for an asset or liability; or
(b) components of such income and expenses if those components have different characteristics and
are identified separately. For example, a change in the current value of an asset can include the
effects of value changes and the accrual of interest (see Table 6.1). It would be appropriate to
classify those components separately if doing so would enhance the usefulness of the resulting
financial information.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income 
7.15 Income and expenses are classified and included either: 
(a) in the statement of profit or loss; 11 or
11 The Conceptual Framework does not specify whether the statement(s) of financial performance comprise(s) a single statement 
or two statements. The Conceptual Framework uses the term ‘statement of profit or loss’ to refer to a separate statement and to 
a separate section within a single statement of financial performance. Likewise, it uses the term ‘total for profit or loss’ to refer
both to a total for a separate statement and to a subtotal for a section within a single statement of financial performance.

(b) outside the statement of profit or loss, in other comprehensive income.
7.16 The statement of profit or loss is the primary source of information about an entity’s financial 
performance for the reporting period. That statement contains a total for profit or loss that provides a 
highly summarised depiction of the entity’s financial performance for t he period. Many users of 
financial statements incorporate that total in their analysis either as a starting point for that analysis or 
as the main indicator of the entity’s financial performance for the period. Nevertheless, understanding 
an entity’s finan cial performance for the period requires an analysis of all recognised income and 
expenses—including income and expenses included in other comprehensive income —as well as an 
analysis of other information included in the financial statements. 
7.17 Because the statement of profit or loss is the primary source of information about an entity’s financial 
performance for the period, all income and expenses are, in principle, included in that statement. 
However, in developing Standards, the Council may decide in exceptional circumstances that income 
or expenses arising from a change in the current value of an asset or liability are to be included in other 
comprehensive income when doing so would result in the statement of profit or loss providing more 
relevant information, or providing a more faithful representation of the entity’s financial performance 
for that period. 
7.18 Income and expenses that arise on a historical cost measurement basis (see Table 6.1) are included in 
the statement of profit or loss. That is also the case when income and expenses of that type are separately 
identified as a component of a change in the current value of an asset or liability. For example, if a 
financial asset is measured at current value and if interest income is identified separately from other 
changes in value, that interest income is included in the statement of profit or loss. 
7.19 In principle, income and expenses included in other comprehensive income in one period are reclassified 
from other comprehensive income into the statement of profit or loss in a future period when doing so 
results in the statement of profit or loss providing more relevant information, or providing a more 
faithful representation of the entity’s financial performance for that future period. However , if, for 
example, there is no clear basis for identifying the period in which reclassification would have that 
result, or the amount that should be reclassified, the Council may, in developing Standards, decide that 
income and expenses included in other comprehensive income are not to be subsequently reclassified. 
Aggregation 
7.20 Aggregation is the adding together of assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses that have shared 
characteristics and are included in the same classification. 
7.21 Aggregation makes information more useful by summarising a large volume of detail. However, 
aggregation conceals some of that detail. Hence, a balance needs to be found so that relevant information 
is not obscured either by a large amount of insignificant detail or by excessive aggregation. 
7.22 Different levels of aggregation may be needed in different parts of the financial statements. For example, 
typically, the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance provide 
summarised information and more detailed information is provided in the notes.

CHAPTER 8—CONCEPTS OF CAPITAL AND CAPITAL 
MAINTENANCE 
CONCEPTS OF CAPITAL 8.1 
CONCEPTS OF CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND THE DETERMINATION 
OF PROFIT 8.3 
CAPITAL MAINTENANCE ADJUSTMENTS 8.10 
The material included in Chapter 8 has been carried forward unchanged from the Conceptual 
Framework for Financial Reporting  issued in 2010. That material originally appeared in the 
Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements issued in 1989. 
Concepts of capital 
8.1 A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under 
a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is 
synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as 
operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, 
units of output per day. 
8.2 The selection of the appropriate concept of capital by an entity should be based on the needs of the users 
of its financial statements. Thus, a financial concept of capital should be adopted if the users of financial 
statements are primarily concerned with the maintenance of nominal invested capital or the purchasing 
power of invested capital. If, however, the main concern of users is with the operating capability of the 
entity, a physical concept of capital should be used. The concept chosen indicates the goal to be attained 
in determining profit, even though there may be some measurement difficulties in making the concept 
operational. 
Concepts of capital maintenance and the determination of profit 
8.3 The concepts of capital in paragraph 8.1 give rise to the following concepts of capital maintenance: 
(a) Financial capital maintenance . Under this concept a profit is earned only if the financial (or
money) amount of the net assets at the end of the period exceeds the financial (or money) amount
of net assets at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions
from, owners during the period. Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal
monetary units or units of constant purchasing power.
(b) Physical capital maintenance . Under this concept a profit is earned only if the physical
productive capacity (or operating capability) of the entity (or the resources or funds needed to
achieve that capacity) at the end of the period exceeds the physical productive capacity at the
beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners
during the period.

<!-- page 78 -->

PART I  : SEC.(1) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 11.03.2020 
8.4 The concept of capital maintenance is concerned with how an entity defines the capital that it seeks to 
maintain. It provides the linkage between the concepts of capital and the concepts of profit because it 
provides the point of reference by which profit is measured; it is a prerequisite for distinguishing 
between an entity’s return on capital and its return of capital; only inflows of assets in excess of amounts 
needed to maintain capital may be regarded as profit and therefore as a return on capital. Hence, profit 
is the residual amount that remains after expenses (including capital maintenance adjustments, where 
appropriate) have been deducted from income. If expenses exceed income the residual amount is a loss. 
8.5 The physical capital maintenance concept requires the adoption of the current cost basis of 
measurement. The financial capital maintenance concept, however, does not require the use of a 
particular basis of measurement. Selection of the basis under this concept is dependent on the type of 
financial capital that the entity is seeking to maintain. 
8.6 The principal difference between the two concepts of capital maintenance is the treatment of the effects 
of changes in the prices of assets and liabilities of the entity. In general terms, an entity has maintained 
its capital if it has as much capital at the end of the period as it had at the beginning of the period. Any 
amount over and above that required to maintain the capital at the beginning of the period is profit. 
8.7 Under the concept of financial capital maintenance where capital is defined in terms of nominal 
monetary units, profit represents the increase in nominal money capital over the period. Thus, increases 
in the prices of assets held over the period, conventionally referred to as holding gains, are, conceptually, 
profits. They may not be recognised as such, however, until the assets are disposed of in an exchange 
transaction. When the concept of financial capital maintenance is defined in terms of constant 
purchasing power units, profit represents the increase in invested purchasing power over the period. 
Thus, only that part of the increase in the prices of assets that exceeds the increase in the general level 
of prices is regarded as profit. The rest of the increase is treated as a capital maintenance adjustment 
and, hence, as part of equity. 
8.8 Under the concept of physical capital maintenance when capital is defined in terms of the physical 
productive capacity, profit represents the increase in that capital over the period. All price changes 
affecting the assets and liabilities of the entity are viewed as changes in the measurement of the physical 
productive capacity of the entity; hence, they are treated as capital maintenance adjustments that are 
part of equity and not as profit. 
8.9 The selection of the measurement bases and concept of capital maintenance will determine the 
accounting model used in the preparation of the financial statements. Different accounting models 
exhibit different degrees of relevance and reliability and, as in other areas, management must seek a 
balance between relevance and reliability. This Conceptual Framework  is applicable to a range of 
accounting models and provides guidance on preparing and presenting the financial statements 
constructed under the chosen model. At the present time, it is not the intention of the Council to prescribe 
a particular model other than in exceptional circumstances, such as for those entities reporting in the 
currency of a hyperinflationary economy. This intention will, however, be reviewed in the light of world 
developments. 
Capital maintenance adjustments 
8.10 The revaluation or restatement of assets and liabilities gives rise to increases or decreases in equity. 
While these increases or decreases meet the definition of income and expenses, they are not included in 
the income statement under certain concepts of capital maintenance. Instead these items are included in 
equity as capital maintenance adjustments or revaluation reserves.

References to the Conceptual Framework in SLFRSs. An entity shall apply the amendment to SLFRS 2 
retrospectively, subject to the transitional provisions in paragraphs 53–59 of this Standard, in accordance 
with LKAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. However, if an entity 
determines that retrospective application would be impracticable or would involve undue cost or effort, 
it shall apply the amendment to SLFRS 2 by referenc e to paragraphs 23–28, 50–53 and 54F of LKAS 
8. 
 
In Appendix A, the footnote to the definition of an equity instrument is amended. New text is 
underlined and deleted text is struck through. 
 
* The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in 2018 defines a liability as a present 
obligation of the entity arising fromto transfer an economic resource as a result of past events, the 
settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying 
economic benefits (ie an outflow of cash or other assets of the entity). 
  
 
 
Amendment to SLFRS 3 Business Combinations 
 
In paragraph 11, the footnote to ‘ Framework’ is deleted and a footnote to ‘ Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’ is added. Paragraph 11 has not been otherwise 
amended but is included for ease of reference. New text is underlined and deleted text is struck through. 
Recognition conditions 
11 To qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition me thod, the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements † at the acquisition date. For example, costs the 
acquirer expects but is not obliged to incur in the future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree 
or to terminate the employment of or relocate an acquiree’s employees are not liabilities at the 
acquisition date. Therefore, the acquirer does not recognise  those costs as part of applying the 
acquisition method. Instead, the acquirer recognises those costs in its post -combination financial 
statements in accordance with other SLFRSs. 
 
† For this Standard, acquirers are required to apply the definitions of an asset and a liability 
and supporting guidance in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements adopted by the Council in 2011 rather than the Conceptual Framework 
for Financial Reporting issued in 2018.

Amendment to SLFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 
 
The footnote to the first occurrence of ‘reliable’ in paragraph 13 is added. 
* The term “faithful representation”, which was used in the Conceptual Framework issued in 2010 
and is also used in the revised version of the Conceptual Framework issued in 2018, encompasses 
the main characteristics that the Framework called “reliability”. The requirement in paragraph 13 
of this Standard is based on the requirements of LKAS 8, which retains the term “reliable”.

Definitions 
7 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: 
 ...  
 Material Omissions or misstatements of items are material if they could, individuall y or 
collectively, influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial 
statements. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the omission or misstatement judged in 
the surrounding circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be 
the determining factor. 
 Assessing whether an omission or misstatement could influence economic decisions of users, and so be 
material, requires consideration of the characteristics of those users. The Framework for the Preparation 
and Presentation of Financial Statements states in paragraph 25 that ‘usersUsers are assumed to have a 
reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and a willingness to study 
the information with reasonable diligence .’ Therefore, the assessment needs to take into account how 
users with such attributes could reasonably be expected to be influenced in making economic decisions. 
 
 ...  
Fair presentation and compliance with SLFRSs 
15 Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the d efinitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the FrameworkConceptual Framework 
for Financial Reporting  (Conceptual Framework ). The application of SLFRSs, with additional 
disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair 
presentation. 
 ...  
19 In the extremely rare circumstances in which management concludes that compliance with a 
requirement in an SLFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective o f 
financial statements set out in the FrameworkConceptual Framework, the entity shall depart from 
that requirement in the manner set out in paragraph 20 if the relevant regulatory framework 
requires, or otherwise does not prohibit, such a departure. 
20 When an entity departs from a requirement of an SLFRS in accordance with paragraph 19, it 
shall disclose: 
(a) that management has concluded that the financial statements present fairly the entity’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows; 
(b) that it has complied with applicable SLFRSs, except that it has departed from a particular 
requirement to achieve a fair presentation; 
(c) the title of the SLFRS from which the entity has departed, the nature of the departure, 
including the treatment that  the SLFRS would require, the reason why that treatment 
would be so misleading in the circumstances that it would conflict with the objective of 
financial statements set out in the FrameworkConceptual Framework, and the treatment 
adopted; and 
(d) for each period presented, the financial effect of the departure on each item in the financial 
statements that would have been reported in complying with the requirement. 
 ...

23 In the extremely rare circumstances in which management concludes that compliance wit h a 
requirement in an SLFRS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of 
financial statements set out in the FrameworkConceptual Framework, but the relevant regulatory 
framework prohibits departure from the requirement, the entity sh all, to the maximum extent 
possible, reduce the perceived misleading aspects of compliance by disclosing: 
(a) the title of the SLFRS in question, the nature of the requirement, and the reason why 
management has concluded that complying with that requiremen t is so misleading in the 
circumstances that it conflicts with the objective of financial statements set out in the 
FrameworkConceptual Framework; and 
(b) for each period presented, the adjustments to each item in the financial statements that 
management has concluded would be necessary to achieve a fair presentation. 
24 For the purpose of paragraphs 19 –23, an item of information would conflict with the objective of 
financial statements when it does not represent faithfully the transactions, other events an d conditions 
that it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent and, consequently, it 
would be likely to influence economic decisions made by users of financial statements. When assessing 
whether complying with a specific req uirement in an SLFRS would be so misleading that it would 
conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the FrameworkConceptual Framework, 
management considers: 
(a) why the objective of financial statements is not achieved in the particular circumstances; and 
(b) how the entity’s circumstances differ from those of other entities that comply with the 
requirement. If other entities in similar circumstances comply with the requirement, there is a 
rebuttable presumption that the entity’s compli ance with the requirement would not be so 
misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the 
FrameworkConceptual Framework. 
 ...  
 
Accrual basis of accounting 
 ...  
28 When the accrual basis of accounting is used, an entity recognises items as assets, liabilities, equity, 
income and expenses (the elements of financial statements) when they satisfy the definitions and 
recognition criteria for those elements in the FrameworkConceptual Framework. 
 ...  
Profit or loss for the period 
 ...  
89 Some SLFRSs specify circumstances when an entity recognises particular items outside profit or loss 
in the current period. LKAS 8 specifies two such circumstances: the correction of error s and the effect 
of changes in accounting policies. Other SLFRSs require or permit components of other comprehensive 
income that meet the Framework’s Conceptual Framework’s definition of income or expense to be 
excluded from profit or loss (see paragraph 7).

applicability of, the following sources in descending order: 
(a) the requirements in SLFRSs dealing with similar and related issues; and 
(b) the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses in the FrameworkConceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual

54F Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in SLFRSs , issued in 2018, amended 
paragraphs 6 and 11(b). An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2020. Earlier application is permitted if at the same time an entity also applies all other 
amendments made by Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in SLFRSs . An entity 
shall apply the amendments to paragraphs 6 and 11(b) retrospectively in accordance with this Standard. 
However, if an entity determines that retrospective application would be impracticable or would involve 
undue cost or effort, it shall apply the amendments to paragraphs 6 and 11(b) by reference to paragraphs 
23–28 of this Standard. If retrospective application of any amendment in Amendments to References to 
the Conceptual Framework in SLFRSs would involve undue cost or effort, an entity shall, in applying 
paragraphs 23–28 of this Standard, read any reference except in the last sentence of paragraph 27 to ‘is 
impracticable’ as ‘involves undue cost or effort’ and any reference to ‘practicable’ as ‘possible without 
undue cost or effort’. 
 
54G If an entity does not apply SLFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts , the entity shall, in applying 
paragraph 11(b) to regulatory account balances, continue t o refer to, and consider the applicability of, 
the definitions, recognition criteria, and measurement concepts in the Framework for the Preparation 
and Presentation of Financial Statements* instead of those in the Conceptual Framework. A regulatory 
account balance is the balance of any expense (or income) account that is not recognised as an asset or 
a liability in accordance with other applicable SLFRSs but is included, or is expected to be included, by 
the rate regulator in establishing the rate(s) that c an be charged to customers. A rate regulator is an 
authorised body that is empowered by statute or regulation to establish the rate or a range of rates that 
bind an entity. The rate regulator may be a third -party body or a related party of the entity, incl uding 
the entity’s own governing board, if that body is required by statute or regulation to set rates both in the 
interest of the customers and to ensure the overall financial viability of the entity.

financial position or the statement(s) of financial performance,  an item that meets the definition of an 
elementone of the elements of the financial statements  and satisfies the criteria for recognition’ . The 
definitions of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are fundamental to recognition, at the end of both 
annual and interim financial reporting periods. 
 ...  
33 An essential characteristic of income (revenue) and expenses is that the related inflows and outflows of 
assets and liabilities have already taken place. If those inflows or outflows have taken place, the related 
revenue and expense are recognised; otherwise they are not recognised. The Framework says that 
‘expenses are recognised in the income statement when a decrease in future economic benefits related 
to a decrease in an asset or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably… [ The] 
FrameworkConceptual Framework  does not allow the recogn ition of items in the balance

5 This Interpretation does not apply to expenditure on purchasing, developing, and operating hardware 
(eg web servers, staging servers, production servers and Internet connections) of a web site. Such 
expenditure is accounted for under LKAS 16. Additionally,  when an entity incurs expenditure on an 
Internet service provider hosting the entity’s web site, the expenditure is recognised as an expense under 
LKAS 1.88 and the Framework*Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting when the services are 
received. 
 
* The reference to the Framework is to IASC’s Framework for the Preparation and Presentation
