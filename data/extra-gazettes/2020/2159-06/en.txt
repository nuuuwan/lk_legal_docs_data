If some person was given the authority to issue a gate
pass, that has to be brought to the notice of the Human
Resources Department.
He further said the gate pass marked as R2 was issued in
the name of an out sider and that was wrong.
The Witness stated A 06 which was the letter issued in
order assign duties to the Applicant and it was signed by the
Civil Engineer, Sumanadasa Ranasinghe.
The witness said at the inquiry he rejected A06, as it was
not properly certified, and a copy of which was not found in
the personal file.
During the cross examination witness stated as follows ;
The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Transport Board is the
Authority for the enforcement of discipline.
The witness further said at the inquiry no evidence was
lead in respect of the fact that an Employee who wrote a
gate pass can not be the signatory for the same.
The witness further said when some good brought into
the premises of SLTB and duly recorded it will become a
property of SLTB. The witness further said it was recorded
in the books of SLTB on 15.12.2009, that the load of planks
in question was taken out from the premises of the SLTB.
The witness further said according to R11, Disciplinary
Inquiry Report in page 27, evidence of the Store Keeper,
Fernando has stated that nothing was recorded to say that a
load of timber planks were brought in on 15.12.2019 (A
18).
The witness further said since the timber was brought on
credit basis and money was not paid therefor no monetary
loss was incurred.
During the cross examination witness stated as follows :
According to rules and regulation of SLTB, it was not
mentioned that a person can not write and sign a Gate Pass
and nor evidence was brought in that respect during the
Disciplinary Inquiry.
In A 20 witness has stated It is a grave misconduct to take
out property owned by SLTB without permission.
In A19 witness has stated that there was no monetary loss
to the SLTB by returning the timber as no payment was made
for them.
Those statements are contradictory.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to following
conclusions.
i. The Applicant has acted bona fide  in issuing and
signing a gate pass upon authority vested him in
returning the load of planks which were not up to
the required standard.
ii. The Applicant was permitted to write a gate pass
when permitted by the Department Head as per A6.
Vide Evidence of T. K. Pathirana, Disciplinary
Inquiry Officer (Depot Manager) dated
11.10.2011.
iii. The Responded failed to show that there was a
provision in Sri lanka Transport Board rules and
regulations that a person who writes a gate pass
cant not be the signatory to it at the same time as
instructed by his superior.
iv . There was no monetary loss incurred by the
Respondent by returning the timber as they were
not property of the Sri Lanka Transport Board.
v . The witness T. K. Pathirana's evidence found to be
contradictory.
vi. The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously
towards the applicant by denying the Applicant of
his salary for the period of 8 months and 9 days.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision
of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just
and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms
of the contract of employment. He can create new rights
and introduce new obligations between the parties. The
effect of the award is to introduce terms which become
implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as
industrial arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in
contrasts to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising
out an existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles
disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come
into force in the future when he cannot get the parties to
agree to them in contract to a judge who determines the
existing right and liabilities of the parties.
