Report of the Auditor General :–   Report on Review of the Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as at 31st October 2020
Introduction
I have reviewed the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as at 31st October 2020.  Management is Responsible for the preparation and presentation of this Balance Sheet. My responsibility
is to express a conclusion on this Balance Sheet based on my review.
Scope of Review
I conducted my review in accordance with Sri Lanka Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of the Balance
Sheet consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matter, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable me to obtain assurance that I would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
Accordingly, I do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the accompanying Balance Sheet is not prepared, in all material respects.
                                     W. P. C. Wickramaratne,
                                         Auditor General.
