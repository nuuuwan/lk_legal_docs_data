PART I: S EC. (I) – GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA – 13.08.2020
(a) The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the Applicant denying him promotion to
Executive Grade IV .
(b) The Respondent has acted maliciously towards the Applicant placing him lower as the Security
Officer, subject to a probationary period.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms
of the contract of employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect
of the award is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial
arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in contrasts to ajudge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an
existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles disputs by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force
in the future when he cannot ge the parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and
liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the Respondent Industrial Development Board, (party of the second part)
has caused injustice to the Applicant, M. W. A. S. B. Rambukwella. (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the
First part:
(i) be paid a sum of Rupees Forty Four Thousand (Rs. 44,000/=) being arrears due on gratuity. (calculated as per
A 22)
(ii) be paid further some of Rupees Nine Hundred Forty Three Thousand Five Hundred Fifty and censt Forty One
(Rs. 9,43,550.41) being financial loss to the Applicant not promoting him to the respective grade with effect from
03.09.2008 (calculated as per A 22(1)).
And the aforesaid money should be deposited by the Party of the Second Part at the office of the Assistant Commissioner
of Labour, Colombo South.
I further make order that his award should be implemented within 21 days of the publication in the Government Gazette
of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
I condiser this award is just and equitable.
