Greetings !
Whereas, you have been appointed members of the Task Force established by the Presidential Directive dated
27.04.2020 in the exercise of the powers vested in me by Article 33 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of
Sri Lanka to make a study of the measures that need to be adopted by each Armed Force in order to prevent the members of
the three Armed Forces from being infected by Corona Virus and provide advice on the implementation of such measures.
And whereas, there appears to be a tendency at present towards the incidence of Corona Virus infection among
those addicted to drugs and inmates of the Prisons.

And whereas, I have identified the imperative need for speedy and immediate measures to be adopted with a view
to containing the spread of the Virus and preventing incidence of infection in the community.
And whereas, I am of the opinion that the remit of the above Presidential Task Force needs to be broadened, I do
hereby include those addicted to drugs now under rehabilitation as well as inmates of the Prisons within the province of the
Task Force as set out in my Directive.
Accordingly, I hereby direct that matters relating to those addicted to drugs under rehabilitation and inmates of the
Prisons too be attended to in the execution of the task assigned to you by the aforesaid Directive.
Given at Colombo under the Seal of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on the 16th day of July, Two
Thousand and Twenty.
By His Excellency’s Command,
P.  B.  J
AYASUNDERA,
 Secretary to the President.
