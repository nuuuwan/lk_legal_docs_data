And, as it is imperative to establish a new economic agenda to promote exports in all sectors and uplift all local
industries including local food production in a background where all global trends have shifted due to the current pandemic
situation and overseas supplies have been suspended,
And, as the attention of the current government is focused on technology, research and innovation towards fulfilling
expectations of the rural public, plantation communities and low income earning urban public who have been frustrated at
their role not being properly evaluated in terms of their skills, exceptional abilities and potentials as well as their weaknesses
and challenges in a context where during the past period, the local economic strengths had not been subject to due appraisal
within the international context,
And, as the need has been clearly identified to create balanced social and economic development at the district
level,through overall economic targets to be achieved by Sri Lanka in the future, the expectations recognized by the
United Nations such as development, environmental conservation, renewable energy and toxin-free food production, as
well as the need to minimize poverty and trends that enhance the gap between haves and have-nots in the context of global
economic trends,
And, whereas, poverty has been a major drawback in achieving the said development goals for a secure and
prosperous nation and that an unprecedented need has arisen for strategies to be adopted for empowerment of rural
communities based on a people-centric economy,
And, as priority has to be given to the need to align national development programmes to the nation building
strategy planned out in the state policy vision: Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour,
And, as a dedicated Presidential Task Force has been set up to expand health and education facilities at rural and
regional levels, promote health, quality of food consumption and environment conservation, as well as skills and
competencies of students, and priority has been given to expand health, education and skills opportunities,
And, as it is imperative that a unique economic framework with a novel approach is established by reviving small
and medium scale enterprises through the established government machinery comprising central government ministries,
district secretariats and divisional secretariats, and by expanding access for finance through Banking and Financial
Institutions as appropriate for the rural, estate and low income earning people to be directly linked to the local economic
empowerment process as entrepreneurs,
Now, therefore, I, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic  Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka reposing
great trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity  do by these presents  appoint you the said,
