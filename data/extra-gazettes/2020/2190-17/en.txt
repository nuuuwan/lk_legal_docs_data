in the Eastern Province established by the Presidential Directive dated 01.06.2020 by exercising the powers vested in me by

Further, I, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, in accordance with the
powers vested in me by Article 33 of the Constitution of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, appoint the following
Bhikkus as the members of the Presidential Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province,
