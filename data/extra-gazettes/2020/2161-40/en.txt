vi. By A7, The letter addressed by the Director General
of Road Development Authority to the Assistant
Commissioner of Labour , Matara, it was not
mentioned that the Applicant was transferred from
I Road Project for a service necessity but has
merely stated transferred due to internal reasons
which was not specified.
vii. The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously
towards the applicant by transferring him from I
Road Project depriving him the Project Allowance
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority
decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India
vs. Edirisinghe ( 1991) that the arbitrator has to
make an award which is just and equitable , he is
not tied down and fettered by the terms of the
contract of employment. He can create new rights
and introduce new obligations between the parties.
The effect of the award is to introduce terms which
become implied terms of the contract. It was
pointed out that as industrial arbitrator creates a
new contract for the future in contrasts to a judge
who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an
existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles
disputes by dictating new conditions of
employment to come into force in the future when
he cannot get the parties to agree to them in
contrast to a judge who determines the existing right
and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the
Respondent, Road Development Authority (party of the
second part) has caused injustice to the Applicant, A.V .
Ekanayaka ( party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality
of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the
First part:
i. be paid a sum of Rupees Two Million Five Hundred and
Eighty Seven Thousand and Five Hundred
(Rs. 2,587,500/-) being the Project Allowance at the rate of
Rs. 57,500/- for 45 months .
And the aforesaid money should be deposited by the Party
of the Second Part at the office of the Assistant Commissioner
of Labour, Matara.
I, further make order that this award should be implemented
within 21 days of the publication in the Government Gazette
of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award is just and equitable.
