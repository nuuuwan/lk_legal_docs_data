laws in force at the time or an Award of Court,
such employee shall only be entitled to a pension
or such compensation as opted by him, but not
to both. Provided further that in the case of an
employee whose premature retirement occurred
in consequence of an accident which entitled him
to compensation, the pre-acceptance of pension
as provided herein will not restrict the right of
such employee in subsequently claiming any
balance compensation under any written law.

in terms of (a) or (b) above may at his discretion
opt for the payment of a lump sum gratuity in lieu

pension in terms of Clause 16.

dependents of the deceased employee, as may
be determined by the Bank at its sole discretion
on the basis of information supplied to them. In
the case of the death of an employee who is not
confirmed in employment the amount payable will
be 50% of that payable to a confirmed employee
provided that in the case of an employee who
has not been confirmed consequent upon a
promotion to a higher grade, the gratuity payable
will be calculated as in the case of a confirmed
employee. The gross salary for this purpose shall
be the last drawn salary plus Cost of Living
Allowance.
Provided, however, that in the event of death
arising out of and in the course of employment,
the dependents shall be entitled to and receive
either the death gratuity referred to herein or
payment by way of compensation under any laws
in force at the time on account of Employees’
Compensation or under any other law or an Award
of Court, whichever is higher. Provided further
that in the case of an employee whose death
occurred in consequence, the pre-acceptance of

claiming any balance compensation due to them
under any written law.

Retirement
An employee shall, upon resignation/termination
of employment prior to retirement in
circumstances which do not entitle him to the

computed in terms of the Payment of Gratuity
Act (1983), which shall be paid within 30 days of
the cessation of employment.

salary referred to at Clause 5 and the Cost of
Living Allowance referred to at Clause 7(a) hereof.

only actual continuous service worked excluding
absence/leave without pay, but subject to the
provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act (1983)
and Clause 20 thereof.

of retirement on or after 1
st April 2018, 25%
of the monthly pension into 120 will be paid

(iii) below, receive half his salary from the date of
suspension up to six months and full pay
thereafter, subject to the condition that the delay
was not due to the employee concerned.
(ii) Where the suspension is on account of charges
involving financial dishonesty such as fraud or
misappropriation, the employee will not be entitled
to any salary during the period of suspension
unless the inquiry is not concluded within six
months of the date of suspension in which event
he will receive half his salary (salary plus cost of
living allowance) during his suspension beyond
the said six months period. Provided that if the
delay beyond six months is due to the employee’s
own conduct or due to the employee being in
custody or remand thereby making it impossible
for the Banks to hold or conclude the inquiry,
half such salary as aforementioned will not be
payable.
(iii) In cases not involving financial dishonesty as
aforementioned, where the employer is prevented
from concluding the inquiry within six months of
suspension for reasons beyond the employer’s
control such as where the employee makes
repeated requests for postponements or where
he is remanded or in Police custody or where the
matter is under investigation by the Police, the
employee will continue to receive half his salary
and will not receive full pay in these
circumstances.

period of time as is considered necessary by the
Banks in the circumstances.
(c) If where the employee tenders his explanation

participate in the proceedings but he may answer
any question which the Inquiring Officer may
ask him.

impartiality and shall not attempt to act the role
of the prosecution as well.

conclusion of the inquiry the Bank shall inform
the employee, in writing, of the findings in respect
of the charges and of the punishment, if any,
imposed by the Employer.
(j) Where the Banks fail to inform the employee as
aforesaid within the said period of thirty (30)
working days except for reasons beyond the
control of the Bank or by reason of the conduct
of the employee, such employee shall not be
punished thereafter in respect of such charges
and no inference adverse to the employee shall
be drawn in respect of such charges.
(k) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, the
Bank shall not be required to hold a domestic
inquiry in any of the following circumstances:
(i) Where the employee fails to tender his
written explanation before the expiry of the
time allowed to show cause in which event
the Banks shall be entitled to take
disciplinary action on the basis that such
employee had no cause to show.
(ii) Where the employee makes a written
admission of the charges against him.
(iii) Where the Banks proposes to warn an
employee, but without prejudice to the

receipt of the employee’s explanation shall
not be material or relevant.
(I) The findings of a domestic inquiry and the
punishment if any imposed by the Bank shall be
final and binding on the Bank and the employee
and the Union, unless the employee or the Union
shall within three (3) months from the date on

of such period of suspension, if any such
payment has been made.

  THIRD  SCHEDULE
The parties agree to the following conditions in relation to
the introduction of new Computer Based Banking
Technology by the Banks covered and bound by this
Agreement.
1) Wherever practical, the Banks will endeavour to ensure
that jobs are designed to include a mix of VDU/non
VDU tasks which seek to provide variation in visual
and mental demands upon the operator.
2) The work load of operators of VDUs will be regularly
reviewed by Management for the purpose of ensuring
proper safety and effectiveness of the operation.
3 ) The Bank agree to provide VDU operators with
adequate training within the parameters of their job
description to ensure the safety and health of
employees.
4) (a) In selecting VDUs the Banks will attempt to obtain
equipment which will ensure the following:
i. Screens that give clear stable images.
ii. Proper sitting of keyboards so as to ensure
the reduction of stress and improved
maneuverability.
iii. Equipment which is quiet in operation so
that the level of noise is kept to a reasonable
limit.
(b) The Banks will undertake proper servicing and
maintenance to ensure optimum functioning of
the VDUs.
(c) The Banks will pay attention to the proper
positioning of screens, keyboards and provide
facilities for placing documents and ancillary
equipment in a manner to facilitate the work of
employees.

his commencing employment on a VDU. In the
event of an adverse report being obtained from
the Optician, the employee should inform the
Bank immediately.
(f) Where an employee whose main or primary
function, as decided by the Managements of the
Banks, is the operation of a VDU, and he is
already using spectacles, when he is called upon
to operate a VDU for the first time, he will be
permitted, at the expense of the Bank, to be
examined by an Optician nominated by the Bank
for the purpose of obtaining an opinion as to
whether any modification is necessary to his
lenses. The cost of such examination and
modification to the lenses if necessary, will be
borne by the Bank on the following basis:
(i) The cost of the examination will be met by the
bank outside the limits prescribed by the Medical
Assistance Scheme herein.
(ii) The cost of modification of the lenses will be met
within the Medical Assistance Scheme, but if such
cost should exceed the limits prescribed by the
Scheme, the Bank will bear such additional cost
as well.
5) Accepting the fact that continuous work at a terminal
by a data entry operator causes a certain amount of
strain, the Banks are agreeable to a reasonable pause
in entering information at or about the end of each
period of 2 hours so long as there is no disruption of
the smooth flow of work and so long as such pause
does not exceed 10 minutes.
6 ) The provisions of this Agreement will apply to
employees whose main or primary function, as decided
by the Management of the Bank, is operating a VDU.
Provided however the Union will be entitled to make
representations as to whether the main or primary
function is the operation of A VDU subject to there
being no industrial dispute being raised on this issue.
7) The Bank agree that they will not seek to retrench
employees who become redundant solely and
exclusively in consequence of the introduction of new
Computer Based Banking Technology. Instead, the
Banks may avail themselves of any one or more of the
following options:
(a) The aforementioned excess employees may be
transferred to other sections/departments to
perform work which is within their skill and
capacity without reduction in salary and
allowances which are in force at such time in
relation to such employees. This option refers to
a transfer other than within the scope of
employment which the Bank would under normal
circumstances be entitled to effect.
(b) The Bank may, on a transfer within the scope of
(a) above, re-train an employee if the employer
consider it necessary.
(c) The Bank will be entitled to negotiate with
employees who are redundant for the reasons
contemplated in this Agreement, with a view to
achieving a cessation of employment on terms
mutually agreed upon and this will not amount to
retrenchment within the meaning of this
Schedule.
8) For the purpose of this Agreement retrenchment will
mean an involuntary termination of the employees made
redundant consequent upon the introduction of new
Computer Based Banking Technology. It will not include
a situation where such redundant employees voluntarily
leave the service of the employer on terms mutually
agreed upon.
