6. My findings and Observations.
(a) Sri Lanka Ports Authority was established as a statutory entity per Act, No. 51 of 1979. All employees are
covered under provisions of most of the labour legislations in operation, such as EPF Act, ETF Act, payment of
Gratuity Act, and Industrial Disputes Act. Employees could seek remedies under the provisions of the Industrial
Disputes Act. The applicant sought relief, urging that he be paid salaries due for the period of interdiction, 7
days pay cut imposed by the respondent organization based on a domestic inquiry findings, other statutory
dues and related payments entitled to consequent to magisterial inquiry order  acquitting and discharging him
on all charges framed.
(b) Learned Chief Magistrate in Colombo, in delivering the judgement in case No. 3564/6, specify the following
comments, while acquiting the applicant.

(c) the judgement made by the competent court of jurisdiction, i.e. the Chief Magistrate Court, state that the
application is acquitted and discharged from all counts, as such it's the obligation of the respondent organization
to comply with the judgement. If the respondent was agrieved or disagreed with the learned magistrates
judgement the only re recourse  would be to appeal for relief from a superior court which, they had not done so.
Instead respondent went on to penalize the applicant, by proceeding to impose a fine, based on a disciplinary
inquiry conducted by a non judicial officer of the respondent organization, thus over riding the court  order. The
doctrine of ultra vires applies.
(d) Applicant  pleads that he be paid the following amounts legally due-
(i) Salaries withheld for the entire period of interdiction;
(ii) Unduly imposed 7 days pay cut by way of a fine;
(iii) Bonus, Unpaid for the two years;
(iv) Medical Benifits
At the time of interdiction his salary was Rs. 42,000/- per month
