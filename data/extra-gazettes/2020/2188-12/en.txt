THE INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS OF SRI LANKA
Financial Statements for the year ended 31st December 2019
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To The Members of the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
I have audited the ﬁ nancial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, (“the institute’’), which 
comprise the statement of ﬁ nancial position as at 31st December 2019, and the statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in funds and reserves and statement of cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended, and notes to the ﬁ nancial 
statements, including a summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies. I have also audited the statements of Financial Position 
of F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st December 2019.

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC  OF   SRI   LANKA - 10.08.2020
2A
In my opinion, the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the ﬁ nancial position of the Institute,           
F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at 31st December 2019, and ﬁ nancial performance of 
the institute and its cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.
Basis For Opinion
I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements section of my report. I am 
independent of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code 
of Ethics) that are relevant to my audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, and I  have ful ﬁ lled my other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for my opinion.
Other Information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report, but does not include the ﬁ nancial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.
My opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with my audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁ nancial statements or my knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management And Those Charged With Governance For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of ﬁ nancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the ﬁ nancial 
statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either 
intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for 
overseeing the Institute’s ﬁ nancial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities For The Audit of The Financial Statements
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in ﬂ uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these ﬁ nancial statements.

3A
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. I also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Institute’s internal 
control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁ cant 
doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am 
required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁ nancial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the ﬁ nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and signiﬁ cant audit ﬁ ndings, including any signiﬁ cant deﬁ ciencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

- To promote in general the theory and practice of accountancy and in particular auditing, ﬁ nancial management 
and taxation.
- To enrol, educate and train members who are desirous of learning or improving their skills and knowledge in 
disciplines such as auditing, ﬁ nancial management and taxation.
- Act as the sole authority for promulgating accounting and auditing standards in Sri Lanka.
- To organise, ﬁ nance and maintain schemes for the granting of diplomas, certiﬁ cates and other awards to members 
of the Institute and other professional bodies and to other persons who fulﬁ l the prescribed conditions.
- Adoption and implementation of code of ethics and best practices.
- Conducting of technical awareness campaigns in the form of seminars, workshops and events to ensure continuous 
professional development of the members.
- Regulation and supervision of student education and training.
- Activities on matters of public interest.
1.3 Going concern
Financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Institute is a going concern. The Council have 
made an assessment of the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, 
The Council is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast signi ﬁ cant doubt upon the Institute’s ability 
to continue as a going concern and they do not intend either to liquidate or to cease operations of the Institute. 
Therefore, the ﬁ nancial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
1.4 Financial period
The ﬁ nancial period of the Institute represents a twelve months period from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019.
 1.5 Accounting for Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) 
    APFASL has been set up jointly with the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy (IPFDA) and 
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) in 2012, to enhance the capacity of public sector 
ﬁ nancial management professionals. Both CA Sri Lanka and IPFDA have equally contributed Rs. 10mn as initial 
investment for this project. In terms of paragraph 5.9 of the Articles of Constitution of APFASL, on the occasion 
of dissolution, the fund will either be spent for collective welfare purpose or be granted towards any good cause as 
the general membership feels best.

12A
The assets and liabilities of Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) which had been 
amalgamated with the Institute ﬁ nancials up to year 2015 have been de- recognised from the ﬁ nancial statements 
of the Institute from the year 2016 due to the amendment of certain clauses and provisions of the Constitution of 
APFASL in order to operate as a more autonomous entity.
1.6 Basis of preparation of ﬁ nancial statements
1.6.1  Statement of compliance
The ﬁ nancial statements of the Institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards 
issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
These ﬁ nancial statements comprise the statement of ﬁ nancial position, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in funds and reserves, statement of cash ﬂ ows and notes to the ﬁ nancial statements.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the ﬁ nancial statements unless otherwise stated.
1.6.2 Basis of measurement
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost basis, except where 
appropriate disclosures are made with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
1.6.3 Comparative information
Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of 
the previous period for all amounts reported in the ﬁ nancial statements, in order to enhance the understanding of 
the ﬁ nancial statements of the current period and to improve comparability.
Where necessary, comparative ﬁ gures have been rearranged to conform to the current year’s presentation.
1.6.4 Responsibility and approval of ﬁ nancial statements
The Council of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka acknowledges their responsibility for the 
ﬁ nancial statements and ﬁ nancial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Council at the meeting 
held on 17 June 2020.
1.6.5 Materiality and aggregation
Each material class of similar items is presented separately in the ﬁ nancial statements. Items of a dissimilar nature 
or function are presented separately, unless they are immaterial.

1.6.6  Functional and presentation currency
The ﬁ nancial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Institute’s functional and presentation 
currency, in the primary economic environment in which the Institute operates.
All ﬁ nancial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated 
otherwise.
1.7  Signiﬁ cant accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation and presentation of ﬁ nancial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, 
requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about signiﬁ cant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies 
that have the most signiﬁ cant effects on the amounts recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements is as follows.
(a)   Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka (AAT) and Accounting for Association of Public 
Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL)
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all factors 
and circumstances in SLFRS 10 - “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows;
(a) power over the investee
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Accordingly, Management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to variable returns 
from its involvement with AAT or APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation.
(b)   Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans
The cost of the retirement beneﬁ t plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. 
Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase and retirement 
age. Due to the long-term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to signiﬁ cant uncertainty.
(c)   Changes in accounting estimates and judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the ﬁ nancial 
statements.

2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
2.1 Assets and the bases of their valuation
2.1.1 Property, plant and equipment
(a)  Basis of recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic bene ﬁ ts associated with 
the asset will ﬂ ow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable.
(b)  Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight-line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, in 
order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows;
Asset category Useful life
(years)
Buildings 50
Furniture 5- 10
Plant and Machinery 5-10
Motor vehicles 10
Computers 5
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset 
is classiﬁ ed as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Signiﬁ cant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identi ﬁ ed and 
depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the statement 
of comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of the related asset.
(c) Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁ ts are 
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the year, the asset is derecognised.

15A
2.1.2  Library books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years.
2.1.3  Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital nature, directly 
incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-in-progress 
would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is available for use 
i.e. when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
the Institute.
2.1.4  Intangible assets
a. Computer software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use. 
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of ﬁ ve (5) years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs 
that are directly associated with the production of identi ﬁ able and unique software products controlled by the 
Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
  1.  It is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
  2.  Management intends to complete the software product and use it;
  3.  There is an ability to use the software product;
  4.  It can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic beneﬁ ts;
  5.  Adequate technical, ﬁ nancial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software product 
are available; and
  6.  The expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognised as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed ﬁ ve 
(5) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress until the software is 
ready for use.

16A
b. Study material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA qualiﬁ cations 
are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new curriculum, the investment 
attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably measured and it can be demonstrated that 
it will generate probable future economic beneﬁ ts.
These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful life is reviewed at 
least at each ﬁ nancial reporting year end.
2.1.5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and 
slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the 
estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on weighted average cost. The 
cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and 
condition.
The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.
2.1.6 Impairment of non-ﬁ nancial assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such 
indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂ ows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value, using a discount rate that reﬂ ects 
current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk speciﬁ c to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot “exceed” the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.1.7 Financial assets – Initial recognition and measurement
(a) SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments
SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 on “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting for 
ﬁ nancial instruments: classiﬁ cation and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting.

17A
(b) Financial assets
The classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial assets at initial recognition depends on the ﬁ nancial asset’s contractual cash ﬂ ow 
characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that 
do not contain signi ﬁ cant ﬁ nancing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient, the 
Institute initially measures ﬁ nancial assets at their fair value plus transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not 
contain a signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient are measured 
at the transaction price determined under SLFRS 15.
In order for a ﬁ nancial asset to be classi ﬁ ed and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs 
to give rise to cash ﬂ ows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding. 
The Institute’s business model for managing ﬁ nancial assets refers to how it manages ﬁ nancial assets in order to 
generate cash ﬂ ows. The business model determines whether cash ﬂ ows will result from collecting contractual 
cash ﬂ ows or selling the ﬁ nancial assets or both.
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial 
Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The ﬁ nancial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, ﬁ xed deposits held to collect 
contractual cash ﬂ ows, government securities, repurchase agreements and cash and cash equivalents.
The Institute’s ﬁ nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of both of the 
following conditions:
(a) The ﬁ nancial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold ﬁ nancial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash ﬂ ows and
(b) The contractual terms of the ﬁ nancial assets give rise on speciﬁ ed dates to cash ﬂ ows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
Accordingly, ﬁ nancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method 
and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in pro ﬁ t or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modiﬁ ed or impaired.
2.1.8 Derecognition of Financial Assets
A ﬁ nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a ﬁ nancial asset or part of an Institute of similar ﬁ nancial assets) 
is primarily derecognised when:
The rights to receive cash ﬂ ows from the asset have expired; or
The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂ ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash ﬂ ows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either
(a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
(b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.

<!-- page 18 -->

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC  OF   SRI   LANKA - 10.08.2020
18A
When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂ ows from an asset or has entered into a pass- through 
arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In 
that case, the
Institute also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on 
a basis that reﬂ ects the rights and obligations that the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of 
the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Institute could be 
required to repay.
2.1.9 Impairment of Financial Assets
The Institute recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments measured at 
amortised cost.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash ﬂ ows due in accordance with the contract and all 
the cash ﬂ ows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest 
rate. The expected cash ﬂ ows will include cash ﬂ ows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements 
that are integral to the contractual terms.
For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simpliﬁ ed approach in calculating ECLs.
2.1.10 Reclassiﬁ cation
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the Management intends to hold these instruments to collect 
the contractual cash ﬂ ows upon completion of the SPPI test and evaluating the historical data. As of 01st January 
2018, the Institute has elected the business model of hold to collect the contractual cash ﬂ ows and measured the 
instruments at amortised cost.
Prior to 1 January 2018 ﬁ nancial assets were classiﬁ ed as held to maturity and available for sale. In complying with 
SLFRS 9, ﬁ nancial assets are reclassiﬁ ed at amortised cost. Cumulative balance in AFS reserve is removed and is 
used to adjust the reclassiﬁ ed amortised cost. EIR determined at initial recognition and gross carrying amount are 
not adjusted as a result of reclassiﬁ cation.
Financial assets are not reclassiﬁ ed subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare circumstances 
when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such ﬁ nancial assets.
Consequent to the change in the business model, the Institute reclassiﬁ es all affected assets prospectively from the 
ﬁ rst day of the next reporting period (the reclassiﬁ cation date). Prior periods are not restated.
2.1.11 Financial Liabilities
All ﬁ nancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for ﬁ nancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁ t or 
loss. The Institute does not have ﬁ nancial liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2019.

19A
2.1.12 Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. Bank borrowings that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Institute’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash ﬂ ows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash 
ﬂ ows, which has been prepared using the 'indirect method'.
2.2 Liabilities and Provisions
A liability is classiﬁ ed as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or there is no 
unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. 
The Institute classiﬁ es all other liabilities as non-current.
2.2.1 Deferred Income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes are raised at the commencement 
of the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months. Deferred income is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken place and the balance attributable 
to the remaining course period is recognised as a liability on the statement of ﬁ nancial position until income is 
recognised.
2.2.2 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of ﬁ nancial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outﬂ ow of assets will be required to settle the obligation and the 
obligation can be measured reliably.
2.2.3.1 Employee Beneﬁ ts
(a)   Employee deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Plan - Gratuity
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan is a post-employment beneﬁ t plan, other than a deﬁ ned contribution plan. The deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. The present 
value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ ows, using 
interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁ ts will be paid and that have terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations 
depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions 
about discount rate, future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, 
such estimates are subject to signi ﬁ cant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Accordingly, the employee beneﬁ t liability is based on the actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2019. The 
Institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognise actuarial gains and losses in the period in which 
they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive income.

(b)   Deﬁ ned Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund 
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognised as an expense in the 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross emoluments 
of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively.
2.2.4 Taxation
(a)   Income Tax
The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017.
(b)   Other Taxes
V AT has been paid in respect of rent received by the Institute, letting of movable or immovable property, being 
the only taxable activity carried on by the Institute. Since the Institute is not engaged in carrying on a trade 
or a business, the Institute is not liable for Economic Service Charge or Nation Building Tax. Therefore, no 
provision has been made for any other taxes.
(c)   Deferred Taxation
Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed against the 
liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable income. Deferred tax has not 
been provided in the ﬁ nancial statements.
2.2.5 Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates which 
approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets (including securities) 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange at that 
date. Non - monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated at 
the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realised and unrealised exchange differences are reported 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.3 Accounting for the Receipt and Utilisation of Funds, Grants and Reserves
The Institute received various grants for speci ﬁ c development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have been 
classiﬁ ed as unrestricted funds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
2.3.1 Unrestricted Funds
Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Council and funds 
that are designated for a speciﬁ c purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives of the Institute. 
Allocations made by the Council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income. Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted funds in terms of the relevant donor 
agreements or with the subsequent approval of the donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of references.

2.3.4 Grants
2.3.4.1 Land received as a Government Grant:
Government grants for non-monetary assets are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will 
be received and all attached conditions have been complied with.
The method adopted for accounting for Government grant is income approach, where the grant relating to non-
depreciable asset is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is treated as deemed cost of the land at the date of the recognition of Government grant given in the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
2.3.4.2 Revenue Grants
Other grants are recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements at their fair value. When the grant or subsidy relates to an 
expense it is recognised as an income over the period necessary to match it with the costs, which is intended to

the statement of comprehensive income over the useful life of the asset.
2.4 Statement of Comprehensive Income
2.4.1 Income Recognition
(a)  Income
The sources of revenue of CA Sri Lanka is recognised as per SLFRS 15 on “Revenue from contracts with customers”. 
Accordingly, SLFRS 15 establishes ﬁ ve step model to account for revenue recognition at an amount that re ﬂ ect 
the consideration where CA Sri Lanka expects to provide services to its stakeholders. The Institute has adopted 
SLFRS 15 using the full retrospective method based on the assessment performed and decided that the impact is 
not material to the ﬁ nancial statements and therefore adjustment has not been made in the retained earnings opening 
balance of the statement of changes in funds and reserves.
In terms of SLFRS 15, Revenue is recognised upon satisfactory performance obligation is achieved. CA Sri 
Lanka expects that, the revenue recognition to occur over time where stakeholders (mainly students and members) 
simultaneously receives and consumes the bene ﬁ ts provided by CA Sri Lanka and when the Institute has an 
enforceable right to receive payment for performance completed. Otherwise, the revenue of the Institute is recognised 
at point in time.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
Note 26 - Events occurring after the reporting period       
Since the start of January, the coronavirus outbreak has created disruption for our operations and our key stakeholders 
such as members, students, suppliers and other customers. We understand the difﬁ culties this poses and have put measures 
in place to support them through this challenging time. Depending on how the situation develops, there is a potential for 
any associated economic slowdown which would impact our educational activities. We foresee possible reductions in the 
revenue due to decrease in the student enrolment and volume of transactions taking place, and potential losses stemming 
from disruption to our stakeholder base.  We continue to monitor the situation closely and develop strategies to turnaround.
Health and Safety Measures          
In response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, CA Sri Lanka’s priority is to ensure the health and safety of our stakeholders 
that include members, students and employees and continue normal operations by leveraging our robust business continuity 
plans.           
Economic Impact          
The economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak will depend on how the virus spreads and heavily depends on 
the response of the Government, Sri Lankan regulators and the relevant authorities.  Being a responsible corporate citizen 
involves in the betterment of the accounting profession, CA Sri Lanka always takes all the possible measures in adhering to 
the high quality education guidelines and the regulations.        
  
Financial Impact          
The outbreak will have an impact on the ﬁ nancials of CA Sri Lanka in the year 2020.  CA Sri Lanka is compelled to 
postpone or conduct subject to compliance with the regulations imposed by the authorities of many of its ﬂ agship events in 
the calendar of CA Sri Lanka including Annual Report Awards Competition and National Conference. Further, we had to 
curtail CA examinations, seminars and workshops and other short courses due to the restrictions imposed by the government 
adhering to the health regulations. In that context, CA Sri Lanka has moved more into digital means to provide a value added 
service to its stakeholders and most of the programmes conducted during the year are free of charge.   
       
As the situation is ﬂ uid and rapidly evolving, we do not consider it is practicable to provide a detail quantitative estimate of 
the potential impact of this outbreak on the CA Sri Lanka operations since it is considered to be post balance sheet event. 
         
Apart from the above, there is no other matter or circumstances arose since the end of ﬁ nancial year and to date of the signing 
date of the report that has affected or may affect the economic activities of CA Sri Lanka. Accordingly, no adjustments have 
been made in the ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019.
