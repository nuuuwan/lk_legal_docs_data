Greetings!
Whereas the World Health Organization has indicated to me on a weekly basis that the coronavirus patients
in Sri Lanka as well as the number of suspected coronavirus affected persons is increasing practically in all countries,
And whereas it is the responsibility of the Government to undertake every action necessary for the
eradication of coronavirus disease from Sri Lanka by controlling the aforementioned situation and preventing its
escalation to an epidemic status.
And taking note that the Government has taken measures to implement the necessary operations to control
the above situation jointly with health, security, food distribution sectors and all other Government and Private Sectors.
And as a need has arisen for Government intervention to manage Government and Private Sectors with proper
procedures to provide continuous delivery of public services without disruption to the conduct of normal community
life.
And as food security has become a priority matter due to the emergence of a grave demand for domestic
food production in the context of suspension of overseas supplies.
Now therefore, I, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, reposing
great trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity, appoint you the said :-
1. Basil Rajapaksa Esquire
President’s Special Envoy
2. Roshan Mahesh James Gunathilaka Esquire
Hon. Governor, Western Province
3. A.J.M. Musammil Esquire
Hon. Governor, North Western Province
4. Ms. P.S.M. Charles

5. Gamini Sedara Senarath Esquire
