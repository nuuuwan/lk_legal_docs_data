been resolved amicably, without break in service.
d) Issues of bad conduct refer only during every
years of employment i. e. 1979, 1981 and 1983

07. My observations and findings -
a) Sri Lanka Transport Board is the first statutory
corporation established by the Government of
Sri Lanka. All Statutory Boards, Authorities and
State Corporations are guided by the Directions
of Secretary to the Treasury as well as the
Secretary, Public Administration.
Based on the budget proposals of 2009,
Secretary to the Treasury issued the circular,
addressed to the statutory boards, requiring them
to pay increased cost of living allowance with
effect from 1st January 2010- vide management
services circular No. 29(v) of 06th January,
2010.
In accordance with Secretary to the Treasury
directive, Chief Finance Manager, per Finance
Division Circular No. 02 of 2010, advised all
departmental heads to comply with treasury
instructions.
Present issue concerns the nonpayment of this
payment to the applicant.
b) Applicant joined the Sri Lanka Transport Board
as a store labourer in 1976 (Grade 10) and risen
to the position of Stores Officer (Grade 3) at
the time of retirement. In the early days of his
career, there had been issues of misconduct, in
1979, 1981 and 1983, but since then he had a
quick rise to the supply officer, which proves
merit in his performance.
c) on reaching this age of retirement at 55, he had
to cease employment w.e.f 02nd September
2009 and there were none to take over the Stores
in both Chief Supply Officer and Principal of
Kalutara Driver Training School, where the
applicant was working approached the then
Chairman of Sri Lanka Transport Board and
immediately instructed his subordinates to,
extent his period of service, pending approval
by the Board of Directors.
Here I find that the division responsible for
appointments, have failed to-

i) Appoint a substitute to supplies section of the
Kalutara Driver Training School, when they were
aware of applicant's retirement.
ii) Submit a memo in a last quarter of 2009, seeking
covering approval concerning applicants'
extension service period.
The memo had been submitted on 16th March,
2010, i.e. after 6 1/2 months.
iii) The claim is for Rs. 750 per months for the full
period of 6 months. So the total due would work
out to Rs. 4500 (The cost involved for the State
is fabulous, including State Attorney
appearances and costs for arbitration
proceedings).

I have gave through evidence comprehensively, and am
satisfied that the applicant is entitled for the amounts
claimed since his contract of employment subsists
till he ceased employment with the employer - Rs.

06. Mrs. Surini Perera, salary records executive of
management systems ltd. on behalf of the respondent
organization submitted that -
a) She is required to prepare salary particulars of
employees in about 10 firms. The Company
(MSL) handles preparation of salaries of about
300 organizations, based on the information fed

service.

information and particulars, based on such facts,

(R -16 - 16a)
c) In terms of (R -16) all employees were paid
bonus, but per (R-17) six executives were not
paid which documents, the applicant signed and
forwarded.
07. My findings and observations -
a) The establishment where the applicant was
employed was taken over it's controlling
authority by the major shareholders, Dr. S. A.
Rajaiah, Mr. S. V . Rajaiah and Mrs. I. R. Rajaiah,
who were carrying on business of Renuka Group.
The new management, who took over on 11th
March, 2011, examined it's functions of finance,
sales, purchases, stocks and human resources,
deploying the services of a chief operations
officer, who highlighted several short comings
in the finance controls. After one year of taking
over, the chairman Dr. S. A. Rajaiah, addressed
the senior executives, a meeting in April 2012,
his intention of restructure for betterment of
the organization.
b) By this time the applicant who joined in 1978
as an accountant, and risen to the position of
Chief Executive Officer, was in charge of total
operations, was unhappy about the changes. To
arrest short comings management introduced to
groups in sign cheques, on group to be the the
1st signatory, while the other 2nd signatory, the
question files up debts to the company, basic
reconciliation issues and related matters were
under scrutiny.
c) It is alleged that the management, on 30th June
2012 forced him to sign the letter of resignation,
which is signed, in the core issue now. Applicant
being a chartered account, and with a wide
variety of experience and expertise, running
service firms, had been negligent in his own case.
Analysis of evidence highlights that-

i) Not only he signed the said letter of
resignation, but followed signing
resignation letter of directorship of other
firms subsequently ;
ii) If the resignation was forced in him,
promptly be should have made an entry at
a police station or reported to the nearest
labour office to enquire into this matter.
iii) He had brought to the notice of some
members, who expressed surprise, but
filed to call any to give evidence on his
behalf.
iv) Even after leaving, he had attended several
meetings of the company but did not raise
this issue. Management appointed the
applicant as a non-executive director, but
no evidence of any payment disclosed.
v) For the first time, after six months he
complaints to the Labour Department,
there is element of negligence on his part
and to quote a maxim of equity in English
law - delay defeats equity and no relief
prayed for could be granted.
d) Payment of bonus is not regulated by law. As
such employees had adopted different systems
in the sharing of excess income. Over the years
through the process of collective bargaining, it
has regulated, and become customary or
traditional, so that even the question of profit
may or may not arise at all. Bonus payment is
now a vital instrument of industrial peace and
progress. It is proper to construe the concept
of bonus as sharing by the workers in the
prosperity of the concern in which they are
employed.
However bonus need not be paid for employees
who have been dismissed from service for fraud
rioters or violent behavior, theft,
misappropriation or sabotage of any property
of the establishment.
Bonus is usually paid to the workers at the same
rate in terms of monthly basic wages, in some
cases in terms of consolidated wages, the
efficient as well as the inefficient workers gets
bonus at the same rate.
Management's decision to exclude payment of
bonus to applicant seems discriminatory as every
single worker at any level had contributed for
the organization's prosperity, As such I conclude
that the applicant is entitle to receive the bonus
pleaded for, hitherto unpaid.
e) Applicant's letter of appointment issued in 1978,
provide for the grant of 30 days leave per year
and continue to enjoy the entitlement hitherto.
Applicant claims unutilized leave of 21 1/2 days
and it's monetary value. The provisions of the
Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of
Employment and Remuneration) Act, No. 19 of
1954, Section 6, apply he is therefore entitle to
14 days earned in respect of previous year and
6 days up to 30 June 2012, the date of
termination of employment, totaling 20 days.
Value of which respondent shall pay.
f) Applicants claims for reimbursement of
expenses increase, not supported by actual
documents. Management's approval or
certification is a requirement in such
circumstances. Without submission of authentic
documents, approval for payment cannot be
allowed.
08. Award
In conclusion, having examined the submissions made
by both parties, carefully and comprehensively, I
award that the applicant be paid.
a) Unpaid Bonus - Rs. 750,000/-
b) Value of Unutilized Leave - Rs. 400,000/-
Totaling Rs. 1,150,000 (One Million, One Hundred
and Fifty Thousand only)
This amount shall be deposited with the Assistant
Commissioner of Labour (Colombo South), Labour
Secretariat, Narahenpita, Colombo 05, within 45 days
of publication of this award in the Government
Gazette .
        This is just and a fair award.
