under item 4 above is 28.5mph (Rs. 575.00) and other group/s have contributed a monthly average real crane rate of
30.5mph (Rs. 752.50) during the month, Only those specific group/s will be compensated additionally the difference
of Rs. 177.50 per each shift they worked during the month. Real crane productivity contribution for each ship by
groups as per Shift-log will be used to determine group wise average real crane rate for the month. Monthly average
real crane rate for each group will be calculated by dividing the total moves handled by each group by the total real
crane hours used by the group during the month covering all shifts worked.

Z is applicable only for eligible group/s
PBIS payment for the month = (X+Y+Z) * 1.05
8. Consistent Performance Incentive
This payment is for minimum productivity maintained at 28 or more crane moves per month during the previous
quarter. Percentage payment will be made as per the following table of the total PBIS earned over the quarter up to
the specified maximum limit. This amount will be paid with the last month's PBIS of the quarter. Crane productivity
of each month of the quarter shall be at least 28 or more to be eligible for this incentive.

11. Minimum Criteria/ Special Conditions for PBIS Payment
i. Minimum monthly average real crane productivity of 25 moves per hour should be reached to become eligible for
full PBIS payment for the month. If the monthly average real crane rate is lower than 25 moves per hour, PBIS will
not be paid for that month. Real crane rate used for PBIS is calculated after deducting the crane standby times
which may occur due to any adverse actions of third parties during the specific ship operation. As an example,
any strike action by prime mover drivers resulting in any cranes having to stand by will be deducted from the
crane operating hours when calculating the real crane rate.
ii. However, unions may raise a grievance with the management if the monthly average real crane rate drops below
25 moves per hour for reasons beyond the control of SAGT and its staff.
iii. Payment will be made according to number of shifts worked (inclusive of over time).
iv. Eligibility for Operations and Engineering employees who directly get involved in the productivity.
v. Managers and Executives will not be entitled for this payment.
vi. Fixed amount to all categories.
12. No Pay Leave and Suspensions
Any employee who goes on no-pay or suspended for disciplinary reasons shall lose 5% of the monthly PBIS per
each day of no-pay or suspension. Such employees will lose 5% of the consistent productivity allowance per each
day of no-pay or suspension.
13. Validity Period
This scheme shall be in place for 3 years starting from 01st April 2019 and no revisions will be made during this
period.
