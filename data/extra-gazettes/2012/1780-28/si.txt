(III) The vehicle was taken over by the leasing Company
after about 2 year (2008 Oct)
(IV) He further stated that he himself (Winsely Rodrigo)
and James Jayaratnam were directors of the Concord
Shipping Company.
During re-examination the witness Winsely Rodrigo
stated :
(I) The Applicant was paid the salary for the month of
June after he stopped coming to work as the applicant
had worked about a week in June and there were his
unutilized leave.
(II) The applicant was not requested in writing to report
for work.
Both parties filed written submissions.
The applicant filed the written submission along with the
marked documents A1 to A 14.
In his submission the Applicant stated that since he was
sent on leave by the Respondent company since 30.06.2006,
even thought the applicant done no wrong that the applicant
he granted salary arrears since 30.06.2006 at a rate of Rs. 75,500
per month.
The Respondent filed the written submission along with
the marked document V 1 to V 4 and requested to reject the
Applicant's plea for relief as the applicant's evidence lacks
credibility.
On overall analysis of evidence I have come to following
conclusions :
(I) The Respondent Company acted unjustly and unfairly
by sending the Applicant on compulsory leave
depriving his salary and other benefits and doing so
causing mental agony and financial downfall to the
Applicant without a valid reason.
(II) The Respondent Company has acted malice towards
the Applicant sending him compulsory leave without
pay whereas the Applicant has brought profitable
business to the Respondent Company.
(III) The Respondent Company failed to prove that the
Applicant has vacated the post on his own.
(IV) By doing so (I, II and III) the Respondent has acted
mala fide towards the Applicant.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of
the Supreme Court in state Bank of India Vs. Edirisinghe (1991)
that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and
equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the
contract to employment. He can create new rights and
introduce new obligations between the parties. The effect of
the award is to introduce terms which become implied terms of
the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator
creates a new contract for the future in contrast to a judge
who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing
contract. An industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating
new conditions of employment to come into force in the future
when he cannot get the parties to agree to them in contrast to
a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the
parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the
Respondent Company (party of the Second Part) has caused
injustice to the Applicant. (party of the First Part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality
of evidence led before me I make award that the Applicant (the
Party of the First Part) be paid by the Respondent (the Party
of the Second Part) a sum of Rupees One Million Three
Hundred and Fifty Nine Thousand (Rs. 75,500 x 18 - being 18
months salary) as a full and final settlement.
I further make order that this award should be implemented
within 21 days of the publication in the Government Gazette
of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
I consider this award just and equitable.
