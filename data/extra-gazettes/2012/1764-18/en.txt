Report of the Auditor General  : Review Report on the Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as at 31st May, 2012
I have reviewed the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) as at 31st May, 2012, This Balance Sheet is the Responsibility
of the Management of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. My responsibility is to issue a report on this balance sheet based on my review.
I conducted my review in accordance with Sri Lanka Standards on Reveiw Engagements 2400 applicable to Review Engagements. This Standard requires
that  the review should be planned and performed to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Balance Sheet is free of material mistatements. The review
is  limited primarily to inquires of personnal of the CBSL and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit.
Based on my reivew, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the accompanying Balance Sheet does not give a true and fair view.

Auditor General.
