their scope are encouraged to comply with the recommendations set out in this SoRP .
STATEMENT  OF  RECOMMENDED  PRACTICE
Introduction
1. This SoRPsets out the basic principles and procedures of merger accounting when recognising a common
control combination. If there is any inconsistency between this SoRP and any Sri Lanka Accounting Standards
or Interpretation (collectively referred to as “SLFRS/LKAS”), that Standard or Interpretation is to be followed.
Certain SLFRSs/LKASs may contain guidance or requirements that are relevant for the accounting for a common
control combination using merger accounting. For example, LKAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors requires accounting policies to be applied consistently for similar transactions, LKAS 27
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements addresses consolidation principles and the treatment of a
disposal of a subsidiary and LKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets addresses
provisions for restructuring. Accordingly, an entity should apply that guidance or those requirements, instead
of, or in addition to, the guidance set out in this SoRP when applying Merger accounting.
2. For annual periods beginning on or after 01st January, 2012 SLFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to all
business combinations except where a combination is specifically excluded from its scope. For those business
combinations outside the scope of SLFRS 3, for example, business combinations involving entities or businesses
under common control, there is no specific accounting standard addressing the appropriate accounting treatment.

3AI fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2012'12'21
PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRA TIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 21.12.2012
3. Application guidance of SLFRS 3 (paragraphs B1) defines a business combination involving entities or
businesses under common control as "a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses
are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination, and that
control is not transitory". Such business combinations are referred to hereafter in this SoRP as "common
control combinations" to distinguish them from other business combinations which fall within or outside the
scope of  SLFRS 3.
4. LKAS 8 Accounting Policies , Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors,  paragraphs 10-12, contain
requirements for the selection of accounting policies in the absence of a Standard or an Interpretation that
specifically applies to an issue.  Common control combinations fall outside the scope of  SLFRS 3.  Accordingly,
an entity selects an appropriate accounting policy in accordance with the requirements set out in LKAS 8 and
many entities consider that merger accounting is an appropriate accounting policy for common control
combinations.
The principles
5. The concept underlying the use of merger accounting to account for a business combination is that no
acquisition has occurred and there has been a continuation of the risks and benefits to the controlling party (or
parties) that existed prior to the business combination. Use of merger accounting recognizes this by accounting
for the combining entities or businesses as though the separate entities or businesses were continuing as
before.
6. In applying merger accounting, financial statement items of the combining entities or businesses for the
reporting period in which the common control combination occurs, and for any comparative periods disclosed,
are included in the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity as if the combination had occurred
from the date when the combining entities or businesses first came under the control of the controlling party or
parties.
7. Where the combining entities or businesses include an entity or a business previously acquired from a third
party, the financial statement items of such entity or business are only included in the consolidated financial
statements of the combined entity from the date of the previous acquisition using the acquisition values
recognised at that date.
8. A single uniform set of accounting policies is adopted by the combined entity. Therefore, the combined entity
recognises the assets, liabilities and equity of the combining entities or businesses at the carrying amounts in
the consolidated financial statements of the controlling party or parties prior to the common control combination.
If consolidated financial statements were not previously prepared by the controlling party or parties, the
carrying amounts are included as if such consolidated financial statements had been prepared, including
adjustments required for conforming the combined entity’s accounting policies and applying those policies to
all periods presented. These carrying amounts are referred to below as existing book values from the controlling
parties’ perspective. There is no recognition of any additional goodwill or excess of the acquirer’s interest in
the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost at the time
of the common control combination to the extent of the continuation of the controlling party or parties’
interests. Similarly, in accordance with LKAS 27, the effects of all transactions between the combining entities
or businesses, whether occurring before or after the combination, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated
financial statements of the combined entity.
The procedures
9. The practical effects of merger accounting are that:
(a) the net assets of the combining entities or businesses are consolidated using the existing book values
from the controlling parties’ perspective (see paragraph 8). The assets and liabilities of the acquired

<!-- page 4 -->

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 21.12.2012
entity or business should be recorded at the book values as stated in the financial statements of the
controlling party (i.e. it will require recording of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the
acquired entity or business at the date of original acquisition from third parties by the controlling party,
any remaining goodwill arising on the previous acquisition and minority interests recorded in the
consolidated financial statements of the controlling party).  When the controlling party does not prepare
financial statements, the carrying amounts of the acquired entity are included as if such consolidated
financial statements had been prepared;
(b) no amount is recognised as consideration for goodwill or excess of acquirer’s interest in the net fair value
of acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost at the time of common
control combination, to the extent of the continuation of the controlling party or parties’ interests; and
(c) comparative amounts in the financial statements are presented using the principles as set out in paragraph
9 (a) above as if the entities or businesses had been combined at the previous balance sheet date unless
the combining entities or businesses first came under common control at a later date.
10. The consolidated income statement includes the results of each of the combining entities or businesses from
the earliest date presented (i.e. including the comparative period) or since the date when the combining entities
or businesses first came under the control of the controlling party or parties, where this is a shorter period,
regardless of the date of the common control combination. The consolidated income statement also takes into
account the profit or loss attributable to the minority interest recorded in the consolidated financial statements
of the controlling party.
11. Expenditure incurred in relation to a common control combination that is to be accounted for by using merger
accounting is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Such expenditure includes professional
fees, registration fees, costs of furnishing information to shareholders, and salaries and other expenses involved
in achieving the common control combination. It also includes any costs or losses incurred in combining
operations of the previously separate businesses.
12. Consolidation is performed in accordance with LKAS 27.  The principal consolidation entries are as follows:
(a) the effects of all transactions between the combining entities or businesses, whether occurring before or
after the common control combination, are eliminated; and
(b) since the combined entity will present one set of consolidated financial statements, a uniform set of
accounting policies is adopted which may result in adjustments to the assets, liabilities and equity of the
combining entities or businesses.
Accounting period covered by a newly formed parent
13. A common control combination may be effected by setting up a new parent which acquires the issued shares
or equity of the combining entities or businesses in exchange for the issue of its own shares. In such cases, the
first accounting period of the new parent will frequently be a period of less than a year, ending on the balance
sheet date chosen for the group. This will normally be the existing balance sheet date of one or more of the
combining entities or businesses.
14. Frequently, the date of formation of the new parent will not coincide with the beginning or end of the group’s
accounting periods. Strictly, if the parent is a Sri Lanka incorporated company, the Companies Act requires the
consolidated financial statements to cover the accounting period of the parent. It could be argued that this
requirement prevents the disclosure of comparative information.  In substance, however, where the combining
entities or businesses are continuing to trade as before, but with a new legal parent, it is appropriate to prepare
consolidated financial statements as if the parent had been in existence throughout the reported periods

presented with a prominent footnote explaining the basis on which consolidated financial statements are
prepared.
Disclosures in addition to those required by applicable SLFRSs/LKASs
15. Entities shall disclose the accounting policy applied in accounting for a common control combination by using
the principles of merger accounting.  Details of the accounting policy shall include, but not be limited to, a
discussion of the specific principles and bases applied under merger accounting.
16. Bearing in mind the necessity of showing a true and fair view, entities applying this SoRP shall disclose in their
consolidated financial statements significant details of the common control combinations.
17. For each common control combination accounted for by using merger accounting, the following information
shall be disclosed:
(a) the names of the combining entities (other than the reporting entity);
(b) the date of the common control combination;
(c) the composition of the consideration and fair value of the consideration other than shares issued;
(d) the nature and amount of significant accounting adjustments made to the net assets and net profit or loss
of any entities or businesses to achieve consistency of accounting policies, and an explanation of any
other significant adjustments made to the net assets and net profit or loss of any entity or business as a
consequence of the common control combination; and
(e) a statement of the adjustments to consolidated reserves.
Earnings per share
18. Ordinary shares issued as part of a common control combination which is accounted for using merger accounting
are included in the calculation of the average outstanding shares for all periods presented because the
consolidated financial statements of the combined entity are prepared as if the combined entity had always
existed. Therefore, the number of ordinary shares used for the calculation of basic earnings per share in a
common control combination which is accounted for using merger accounting is the average outstanding
shares of the entity whose shares are remaining after the combination.
Effective Date
19. This Statement of Recommended Practice becomes operative for the financial periods beginning on or after 01
January, 2013.
APPENDIX 1
Numerical Example
This Appendix does not form part of the SoRP and is included for illustrative purposes only. The examples are not intended
to cover all possible scenarios.
Background Information
Entity P has a number of subsidiaries. This example looks at three subsidiaries – Entity X, Entity Y and Entity A.

Entity P acquired 100% of Entity X for Rs. 18,000 many years ago. At that time, Entity P recorded goodwill of Rs. 3,000 and fair
value of identifiable assets acquired of Rs. 15,000 (which is equal to the then carrying amounts of the assets acquired).
Entity P set up Entity Y with a party outside the group, Shareholder S, many years ago. Entity P’s cost of investment in Entity
Y was Rs. 15,000, being 75% of the share capital of Entity Y .
On 1 January 20X0, Entity P formed a new entity, Entity A, through share capital injection of Rs. 10,000.
On 31 December 20X1, Entity A acquired 100% shareholdings in Entity X and Entity Y from Entity P and Shareholder S. In
return, Entity A issued 7,000 and 3,000 ordinary shares with par value of Rs. 1 each to Entity P and Shareholder S, respectively.
Entity A, Entity X and Entity Y have financial year ends of 31 December. The fair values of assets and liabilities of Entity Y as
at 31 December 20X1 are equal to their carrying values.Ignore any tax effect arising from the business combination.

existing book values of net assets of Entity X as at 31 December 20X1 (Rs. 100,000) plus remaining goodwill arising
on the acquisition of Entity X by Entity P (Rs. 3,000). The deemed cost of acquiring Entity Y is Rs. 120,000, being the

Analysis
As Entity A, Entity X and Entity Y are under the common control of Entity P before and after the business combination, the
business combination is specifically excluded from the scope of SLFRS 3.
The directors of Entity A choose to account for the acquisition of the shareholdings in Entity X and Entity Y using the
principles of merger accounting.
Under the principles of merger accounting, the assets and liabilities of Entity X and Entity Y are consolidated in the financial
statements of Entity A using the existing book values as stated in the consolidated financial statements of Entity P immediately
prior to the combination. This procedure requires recording of goodwill arising on the original acquisition of Entity X by
Entity P and minority interests in Entity Y as stated in the consolidated financial statements of Entity P immediately prior to

Note: The comparative figures are restated as if the entities had been combined at the previous balance sheet date. The
consolidated share capital represents the share capital of Entity A adjusted for the share capital issued for the purposes
of the business combination.
Adjustments
(1) Being an adjustment to push back the capital issued for the purposes of the business combination (Rs. 193,000,
of which Rs. 103,000 relating to Entity X and Rs. 90,000 relating to Entity Y). The aim of the consolidated
financial statements in merger accounting is to show the combining entities’ results and financial positions as
if they had always been combined. Consequently, the share capital in respect of 7,000 shares issued for the
purposes of the business combination has to be shown as if it had always been issued.
Relating to Entity X:
(X2) Being an adjustment to record goodwill arising on the original acquisition of Entity X by Entity P as stated in the
consolidated financial statements of Entity P immediately prior to the combination (Rs. 3,000).
(X3) Being an adjustment to eliminate the accumulated profits of Entity X generated prior to the original acquisition
of Entity X by Entity P (Rs. 5,000).
(X4) Being an adjustment to eliminate the share capital of Entity X against the related investment cost of Entity A. An
adjustment of Rs. 85,000 has been made to a separate reserve in the consolidated financial statements of Entity
A.
Relating to Entity Y:
(Y5) Being an adjus tment to eliminate the share capital of Entity Y against the related investment cost of Entity
A. Prior to the business combination, Entity P only had 75% equity interest in Entity Y . Minority interests of

APPENDIX 2
Examples of situations where this SoRP may be applicable
The following are some examples:
a. An entity incorporates a newly formed entity and then transfers some or all of its business to that newly
incorporated entity.
b. A parent company transfers the business of a wholly owned subsidiary into the parent company and liquidates
the subsidiary. That transaction is a change in legal organization but not a change in the reporting entity.
c. A parent company transfers its interest in several partially owned subsidiaries to a new wholly owned subsidiary.
That also is a change in legal organization but not in the reporting entity.
d. A parent company exchanges its ownership interests or the business of a wholly owned subsidiary for additional
shares issued by the parent's partially owned subsidiary, thereby increasing the parent's percentage of
ownership in the partially owned subsidiary but leaving all of the existing minority interest outstanding.
