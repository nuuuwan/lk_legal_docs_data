STATEMENT OF MATTER IN DISPUTE
The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is
Whether Mr. P. Thilakaratne, of the Ceylon Electricity Board who was promoted to the post of Internal Auditor from his earlier post of Internal
Audit Assistant on 01/10/2004 according to the Political committee report, has been caused unjust despite the said promotion, by not being
promoted during the period from 1984 to 2004 due to the non–implementation of Circular No. 1999/GM/18/HRD dated 31/05/1999 and
2001/GM/18(1)/HRD date 11/01/2001 of the General Manager on Recruitments and Promotions Policy No. 2002/GM/32(1) and Circular
dated 29/10/2002, and if so, whether the promotion made to the post of Internal Auditor can be backdated to 05/06/1990 and whether the salary
arrears and allowance should be paid, and if not to what other relief he is entitled.
