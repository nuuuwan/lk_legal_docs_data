(ii) The officer concerned will be granted the right to retire at his discretion, by giving three (03) months notice
between the period 55-60 years of age.
(iii) If the Appointing Authority is of the view that the efficiency and the performance of the officer concerned
is not satisfactory, the power to retire such officer beyond 57 years of age, after giving him six (06) months
notice and providing him an opportunity to appeal during that period, will be vested in the Appointing
Authority.
Provided however,
(iv) Where disciplinary proceedings are pending against the officer or such disciplinary proceedings are
contemplated the retirement of the officer shall be made subject to Section 12 of the Minutes on Pensions.
It shall be the duty of the Head of Department and/or Head of Institution to bring such matters to the notice
of the Appointing Authority when requests for retirement of public officers are made.
(v) Where the officer commits an offence warranting a disciplinary action against him after his retirement has
been approved by the Appointing Authority, the order for retirement shall be converted from normal retirement
to that of a retirement under Section 12 of the Minutes on Pensions by the Appointing Authority, when such
offence is brought to the notice of the Appointing Authority before the effective date of retirement and shall
serve or cause to be served a copy of the order on the officer concerned.
