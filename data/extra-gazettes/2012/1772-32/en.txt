During the cross examination the witness stated.
1. That he has no knowledge when the Carder system,
(which was introduced in 1991) came in to the operation
in the Respondent Co-operation, he said that he is not
aware that who has approved the Carder System (R 34).
Both parties have filed written submissions. The contention
taken by the applicants was that they were penalized as way
were not made permanent as per the circular No. 16 of  1994.,
94(i) and 94(ii).
The contention taken by the Respondent co-operation was
that not a single person was made permanent under circular
16/94, 19/94(i), and 19/94(ii).
All  of the applicants were given salary increments and
promotions.
On overall analysis of evidence I have come to following
conclusions.
(i) The Respondent Co-operation has acted unjustly and
unfairly without confirming the applicants as directed
by Public Administration circular 16/94, 19/94(i), 19/94(ii).
(ii) The Respondent Co-opertion has acted malice towards
applicants keeping them as casual employees for  long
period and thus depriving the benefits of the permanent
employment and depriving the peace of mind of the
applicants.
(iii) By doing so (ii and iii), the Respondent being a Public
co-operation has acted mala fide towards fellow workers.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of
the Supreme Court in state Bank of India Vs. Edirisinghe (1991)
that the arbitrator has to make and award which is just and
equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the
contract 0 employment. He can create new rights and introduce
new obligations between the parties. The effect of the award
is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the
contract. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator creates
a new contract for the future in contrast to a judge who
enforces rights and liabilities arising out an existing contract.

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 23.08.2012
An Industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new
conditions of employment to come into force in the future
when he cannot get the parties to agree to them in contrast to
a judge who determines the existing right and liabilities of the
parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my finding that the
Respondent Authority (party of the Second Part) has caused
injustice to the 8 applicants. (party of the First Part)
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality
of evidence led before me I make award that the Party of the
First Part (8 applicants who are listed below)
1. No. 08 - F. A. Weerasinghe W: 481928
2. No. 27 - R. H. Abeyratne M:157621

7. No. 42 - K. D. Hinton M:145482
8. No. 39 - G . Somasiri C:400700
be paid arrears of salary inclusive of salary incremants, and
promotions which are rightfully due to them on the ground
that they have fulfilled the requirements of the Public
Administration Circular Nos. 16/94 of 10.05.1994, 16/94(1) of
30.05.1994 and 16/94 (11) of 04.07.1994 with effect from 1st
May, 1994.
