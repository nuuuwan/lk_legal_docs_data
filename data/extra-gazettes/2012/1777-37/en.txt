I have reviewed the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) as at 31st August  2012, This Balance Sheet is the
Responsibility of the Management  of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. My responisbility is to issue a report on this balance sheet based on my review.
I conducted my review in accordance with Sri Lanka Standards on Review Engagements 2400 applicable to Review Engagements. This Standard requires
that the review should be planned and performed to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Balance Sheet is free of material mistatements. The review is
limited primarily to inquiries of personnel of the CBSL and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit.
Based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the accompanying Balance Sheet does not give a true and fair view.
H. A. S. SAMARA WEERA,
Auditor General.
