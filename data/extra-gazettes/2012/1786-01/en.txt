RULING  ON  BEARER  BIOLOGICAL  ASSETS
Background :
With the application of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards converged with IFRSs with effect from 1st January, 2012,
SriLanka Accounting Standard, LKAS 41 - Agriculture will be applied in the local context for fair valuation of biological assets
and agricultural produce when they relate to agricultural activity.
The standard defined Agricultural Activity as the management by an entity of the biological transformation and
harvest of biological assets for sale or for conversion into agricultural produce or into additional biological assets.
Hence this Standard can only be applied where there have been active management of the biological assets covered
by the agricultural activity.
Therefore, LKAS 41 does not permit fair valuation of unmanaged biological assets in a plantation.
International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) is reconsidering the fair value treatment for bearer biological
assets, where it may allow preparers an option to measure bearer biological assets using LKAS 16.
Discussion :
In view of the IASB considering the granting of above mentioned option for bearer biological assets, Institute of
Chartered Accountants of  Sri Lanka has decided to grant a similar option to measure bearer biological assets (for example
perennial crops such as tea, rubber and coconut ect.) under LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment.
Recommendation :
* The preparers may measure bearer biological assets (for example perennial crops such as tea, rubber and
coconut ect.) using LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment . However the preparers who wish to fair
value bearer biological assets under LKAS 41 - Agriculture may continue to do so.
* LKAS 41 - Agriculture is only applicable to manage agricultural activity thus does not allow preparers to fair
value unmanaged trees in their plantations.
RULING ON THE COMPARATIVE FIGURES IN THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STA TEMENTS
With the new SLFRS and LKAS coming into effect from 1st January, 2012, interim results shall be required to be
reported by entities in accordance with LKAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.
Taking into consideration the concerns expressed by most of the entities and the short time frame available for the
conversion process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has decided to grant the following alternative
options for the entities when preparing the interim financial statements during the first financial year commencing on or after
1st January, 2012 :–
1. Prepare the interim financial statements in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS/LKAS),
effective from 1st January, 2012 ; or
2. Prepare the interim financial statements in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards existed
immediately prior to 1st January 2012 (SLASs), with disclosures on impact to the Statement of comprehensive
income for the period and Net assets based on SLFRS/LKAS. If determination of that impact is impracticable,
and entity shall disclose that fact ; or
3. Prepare the interim financial statements presenting the current period figures based on Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards (SLFRS/LKAS) effective from 1st January, 2012, while presenting the comparative figures under
the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards existed immediately prior to 1st January, 2012 (SLASs).

However, companies will be required to prepare the financial statements based on full Sri Lanka Accounting Standards
(SLFRS/LKAS) for the annual periods beginning on of after 1st January,  2012. ( i.e. financial statements for the year ended
31st December, 2012 or 31st March, 2013)
RULING ON  DEFERRING APPLICATION OF IFRIC 15 - AGREEMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF REAL ESTATE
With the adoption of IFRIC 15, there have been concerns expressed by the entities on the recognition of revenue
and associated expenses by entities that undertake the construction of real estate directly or through sub-contractors.
Considering the latest developments in revenue recognition - the five step model, which will bring more clarity on
revenue recognition, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has decided to grant an option for entities to defer
application of IFRIC 15 until the five step model comes into effect. However, the companies who use the above mentioned
option should disclose that fact in the financial statements.
