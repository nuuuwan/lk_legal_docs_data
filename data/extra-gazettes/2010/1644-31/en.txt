Industrial Disputes (Special Provisions)  Act,  No. 37 of 1968,
has appointed me to be the Arbitrator by his order dated
03.07.2002 and referred the aforesaid dispute to me for
settlement  by Arbitration.
The matter in dispute between  the aforesaid parties are :-
(1) Whether the termination of the service of the
thirteen (13) employees who were in the service of Trans
Ware Logistics (Pvt) Ltd. and whose names are referred
to in the attached schedule with effect from the dates stated
against each name by the said company is justified and
if not to what relief each of them is entitled.
( 2 ) Whether the suspension of the services of
Mr. M. D. N. D. Deshapriya with effect from 24.12.2001
by Trans Ware Logistics (Pvt.) Ltd, is justified and if not,
to what relief he is entitled.
These two issues appear in the Reference dated 31.05.2002.
At the inquiry which commenced on 28th November,
2002 Mr. E.V . N. Cabraal appeared for the applicant Union and
Dhananjaya Jayakody Attorney-at-Law of the Employers’
Federation appeared for the Respondent Company.
The first issue deals with 7 workers (1) K. P. G . Perera (2)
R. Sarath Jayasiri (3) Y . A. D. Stanly (4) U. D. S. Ranasinghe,
(5) S. A. Nimal Kitsiri, (6) W. A. Kumarasinghe and
(7) R. D. Joseph Raja who services have been terminated
on 02.08.2001 for misconduct on account of insubordination.
The workers R. A. Ranasinghe, U. S. Dissanayake,
M.M.C. Amarasuriya and P. P. Jayantha whose names
appear under Nos. 08-11 were charged for misconduct
for sleeping whilst on duty and their services were
terminated on 08.10.2001. The services of the 12th worker
in the schedule I. S. Y . Chandrasiri were suspended
on 24.12.2001 and later terminated with effect from 09.09.2001
for unauthorized absence.
The 13th employee L. Rohana Chandrasiri has resigned
from service with effect from 25.09.2001. Subsequently his
services have been terminated on the findings of inquiry
officer appointed by the Respondent Company.
The applicant Union has not led any evidence at the
arbitration proceedings in regard this employee L Rohana
Chandrasiri. Being guided by the principal volenti non  fit
injuria, I do not make any award in favour of this employee.
 Following witnesses who were not eye-witnesses gave
evidence for the respondent (TWI).
( 1 ) Joseph Rex Fernando - Human Resources,
Consultant - TWI
(2) Chaminda Kumara Dissanayake - Human Resources
and Transport Manager.
(3) Asanka Sanjewa - Leave Clerk
(4) F. N. de Silva - Domestic Inquiry Officer, a retired
Labour Tribunal President.
Documents R1 to R74 were marked at the inquiry, but
documents R10 to R14 and R41 and R48 were not produced.
The case of 1—7 workers in the schedule .
The charges leveled against the employees whose
names appear under Nos. 1 to 7 in the schedule relate to
incidents of in subordination as stated in the show cause
letters and or charge sheets,
Eg. The show cause letter R41 issued on K. P. G . Perera
charge No. 01 reads as follows :-
“Failure to perform your legitimate duties as required
by paragraphs as 5:3 and 5:4 (c) of your letter of appointment
dated 8th April, 1996.
Charge 02 states that around 10 a.m. on 18th July, 2001 in
a defiant insubordinate manner refused to carry out the
“instructions in respect of the performance of duties that
were given to you by Nalaka Aluthgamage and further
explained by Mr. Rodney de Silva - Maintenance Engineer
thus disrupting the work in the Traffic and Shipping
Department.”
In the charge sheet and or show cause letters issued on R.
Sarath Jayasiri (R 42) Y . A. D. Stanly (R 43/1) U. D. S.
Ranasinghe (R 44/c) Nimal Kitsiri (R 45) W. A. Kumarasinghe
(R 46) and R. A. D. Joseph Raja the two charges are similar
save the dates of offence.
The eye witnesses Nalaka Aluthgamage and the
Maintenance Engineer Rodney de Silva who were directly
involved or witnessed the incidents have not given evidence
in the Arbitration proceedings.
The learned counsel for the Respondent in his exhaustive
written submission dated 22.01.2009 has accepted this
position as the two witnesses referred to above have now
left the company. This point is in favour of the some employees.
In the arbitration proceedings Mr. Joseph Rex Fernando
Consultant Human Resources in this evidence explained that

containers are transported by heavy vehicles moved by prime
movers with large trailer on which one can mount the
container. The workers 1 to 7 are expected to transport loaded
containers from Ja Ela to Port and back.
Mr. Chaminda Kumara Dissanayake giving evidence for
the Respondent marked documents in regard to the workers
01 - 07 in the schedule. The charges leveled against the workers
referred to above were their failure to perform legitimate duties
in a defiant and insubordinate manner to carry out the
instructions in respect of performance of their duties that
were given to them by Mr. Nalaka Aluthgamage and Mr.
Rodney de Silva. In any case as stated by the learned counsel
for the Respondent the evidence of Messrs Nalaka
Aluthgamage and Rodney de Silva fall under the category of
secondary evidence as they did not give evidence in the
arbitration proceedings.
The evidence of K. P. G. Perera whose name appears at No.
1 in the schedule was led by the applicant union on behalf of
the 7 workers in the 1st category of employees.
K. P. G . Perera (at page 3) on 20.06.2007 states as follows :-

According to K. P. G . Perera on or about 17.07.2001 the
drivers were summoned to the office by an announcement
over the loudspeaker. Mr. Nalaka the supervisor asked the
workers to work on the washing bay, the place where the
containers are cleaned. K. P. G . Perera further added :

Under cross examination by the learned counsel for the
Respondent he has stated that he is giving evidence for 1 to
7 workers including himself.
It is clear from the evidence of the workman that all the
7 workers were eagerly expecting their normal assignment as
prime mover drivers to perform their duties.
The Respondent has cunningly confined these workers
to their rest room, having refused lieu leave for working on
Sundays.
With the intention of getting rid of these workers,
cleaning of the containers had been entrusted to the floor
care cleaning company. There is no evidence to show that
these workers refused to take the containers to the washing
bay for cleaning. The retention or confirming of these
employees on a pre-prepared plan seems to be to get rid
of them.
This witness (at page 10 of the proceedings) on 23.07.2007
under cross examination by the counsel for the Respondent
in a sad mood stated :
“ hï W.=,l wmsj megf,õjd ” After the workers were
confined to their rest room,  the company was busy preparing
show cause letters to get rid of them.
In the light of the evidence led before me I am of the view
that the termination of the services of 1 -7 employees as
shown in the schedule in  UNJUSTIFIED. Since the Transport
Department of the Respondent Company is now defunct,
re-employment of these employees is not possible.
Taking into consideration the above facts, and the last
drawn salaries of the employees and the number of years of
their services I order the awarding of compensation to 7
employees as stated below :-

The case of workers 08 - 11 in the schedule
There are four employees in this category -
(8) R. R. A. Ranasinghe - Driver
(9) M. M. C. Amarasuriya - Driver
(10) P. P. Jayasena - Driver
The four workers were dismissed on 8th October, 2001 for
sleeping whilst on duty.
R. R. A. Ranasinghe was served with a charge sheet R27
for sleeping between 2.20 and 2.30 a.m. on 4th May, 2001
inside the vehicle No. 47-8908. The “detection” had been
made by Susantha Jayasinghe Senior Executive and Mr. Eshan
Wanigasekara, Trainee Wharf Clerk, but these two officers
have not give evidence in the arbitration proceedings.
U. S. Dissanayake was charged by charge sheet No. R 28
for sleeping inside vehicle No. 47-8912 between 2.20 a.m.
and 2.30 a.m. on 4th May, 2001.
According to the charge sheet No. R 29 served on M.M.C.
Amarasuriya driver, he was found sleeping between 3.30 a.m.
and 4.30 a.m. on 4th May, 2001.
According to the charge sheet R 30 served on the
employee No. 11 P.P. Jayasena on 4th May, 2001 he was found
sleeping between 2.30 a.m. and 3.30 a.m. by Messrs Susantha
Jayasinghe and Eshan Wanigasekera. According to the charge
sheet the total amount of time spent by the 4 employees who
lost their jobs for sleeping is 140 minutes. The four employees
lost their livelihood for sleeping 140 minute in the early hours
of the day. There is no evidence to show that this alleged
action of the four employees caused any damage or loss
to  the Respondent.
It is not clear how they detected this “misconduct”. The
two witnesses who made the detection have not given
evidence at the arbitration inquiry. However it is unfortunate
in a country like Sri Lanka where there is a developed system
of labour laws for two (2) employees to lose their livelihood
for sleeping 10 minute and two other employees for allegedly
sleeping for 1 hour in the early hours of the day in question.
Domestic Inquiry against 1 -7 employees and 8-11
employees had been held by Mr. F. N. De  Siva, a retired
Labour Tribunal President.
The Domestic inquiry against 8 to 11 employees for the
misconduct of sleeping  was held on 3 days. The workers
were not represented by their Trade Union or any other
person. The report of the inquiry officer was produced marked
R 39.
The second paragraph of R 39 states as follows :-
“The 4 accused have taken up the position that they
were on duty that day from morning and they were carrying
on their duties without a break and they were not sleeping
and they had no time to sleep.”
It appears to be a one sided inquiry. The workers had no say
but the inquiry officer had his way and there was no justice
and fair play.
There was no evidence before me as arbitrator that the four
employees  were sleeping. they were on duty inside their
vehicle expecting a call for an assignment. There was no
evidence that they were asked to undertake a trip or given an
assignments. Out of the four employees, Ranasinghe and

5A
Dissanayake are alleged to have been caught sleeping from
2.20 to 2.30 a matter of 10 minutes. The other two are alleged
to have slept for one hour. It is unfortunate and unreasonable
to terminate their service for sleeping for few minutes. In any
case there was no direct evidence before me that these four
employees slept at all.
Taking everything into consideration I hold the view that
they should not have been given  the Supreme punishment.
Taking into consideration the last salary drawn by them and
the number of years of service to the Respondent Company
I have decided to award compensation at the rate of three
months salary for each year or service calculated as stated
below :-
(08) Mr. R. A. A. Ranasinghe - Driver
Period of service — 5 1/2 years
Last drawn monthly Salary Rs. 5,100
Amount of compensation — Rs. 84,150
(09) Mr. U. S. Dissanayake - Driver
Period of service — 3 years
Last drawn monthly Salary Rs. 5,625
Amount of compensation — Rs. 50,600
(10) Mr. M. M. C. Amarasuriya - Driver
Period of service — 5 years
Last drawn monthly Salary Rs. 5,625
Amount of compensation — Rs. 84,500
(08) Mr. P. P. Jayasena - Driver
Period of  service — 5  years
Last drawn monthly Salary Rs. 5,625
Amount of compensation — Rs. 84,500
I consider this award just and equitable.
The Case of M. D. N. D. Deshapirya - Driver Assistant
The second part of the reference refers to the suspension
of this workman, the driver’s assistant of the vehicle No. 47 -
8908, with effect from 24.12.2001, the documents R. 67 to R. 72
were marked by the Respondent through the evidence of
Chaminda Kumara Dissanayake who was the Manager
(Human Resources) of the Company.  According to R. 67 the
employee had been suspended with immediate for misconduct
and inability to perform duties entrusted to him.
According to the evidence this workman he was detailed
by the management to proceed I.M. Apparals in  the vehicle
at 11.30 a.m. and it was observed by this employee that a
tyre of the trailer No. 67-1646 needed repairs.
The employee had gone for lunch  at about 12.02. leaving
the vehicle in the Transport Division. He seems to have
returned after lunch at about 12.30 to find that the vehicle
was not there.  Therefore his services were suspended by
R72  and an inquiry was held by Mr. F. N. de Silva retired
I.T. President.
The Respondent marked as R73 the original of the letter of
appointment issued to the employee and clause 4:2 of that
letter as  R73 (a) reads as follows :-
“4:2 In case of misconduct you will be suspended without
pay and no notice or payment in  lieu will be made by the
company in the event of your dismissal for such misconduct”
After the disciplinary inquiry by Mr. F. N. de Siva retired
I.T. President his service were terminated. The report for the
formal disciplinary inquiry is filed of record marked R71.
This witness was giving evidence at the formal disciplinary
inquiry held by Mr. F. N. de Siva, Applicant’s representative
showing R70 he inquired whether pages 1, 2 and 3 of the
inquiry proceedings were signed by him. He flatly denied
that his signature appears in the proceedings referred to
above. From his behaviour I understood that either he was
confused or wanted to show the arbitrator that he is under
mental distress. I therefore adjourned the inquiry for
24.11.2008. ?
When this employee resumed his evidence in chief
on 24.11.2008 he admitted that he signed the inquiry
proceedings R70 on page 1 on 24.11.2008.  :
“

m% : wd¾ 70 f,aLKh ;ud w;aika lr ;sfnkjd o ?
W : Tõ .”
Evidence of this nature harms the credibility of the witness
as a whole. I therefore refuse the evidence of the employee.
I make no award in favour of M. D. N. D. Deshapriva.
The case or worker No. 12 in the Schedule L. S. Y.
Chadrasiri.
The case of  this employee is dealt with separately from
the others Mr. Rex Fernando has spent a considerable time in

giving evidence and producing all documents relevant to
this case.  The employees were entitled to 14 days annual
leave and 7 days casual. The workman also accepted this
position that leave should be applied according to a certain
procedure adopted by the Company. Asanka Sanjeewa, the
officer in charge of leave in the department stated that no pay
leave is ordered when an employee has exhausted his quota
of leave and when an employee absented without authority,
unauthorized absence tend to descrupt proper operation of
the business.
Mr. Rex Fernando in giving evidence about I. S. Y .
Chandrasiri states “He was a habitual absentee and repeated
letters of warnings and cautions issued by my predecessor
and I had the occasion also to counsel his unauthorized
absence (Vide page 19 in the proceedings of 06.10.2004 )”
Warning letters R15 (for 1997) R16 (for 1998) R17
(for 1999) R 19 (for 2000) had no effect on this employee.
The employee while giving evidence on his behalf  has
produced A3, A4, A5, A6 and A7 medical certificates with
regard to the fracture of his hand due to the accident caused
to him on 01.05.2001. But I am not satisfied with regard to the
manner in which this employee had obtained prior to the
accident in May 2001 as well.
Consideration the totality of the incidents of leave
appropriated by this employee prior to the accident in
May 2001 and even after the accident, I am satisfied that he
had not reformed himself over the years and no employer
could tolerate such a conduct.
It is clear that the Transport Division of T. W. I. is not
existing now, and taking everything into consideration. I make
no award in favour of I. S. Y . Chandrasiri, the workman
No. 12 in the Schedule.

THE  AWARD
Proceedings.
Proceedings into this arbitration began on 08.06.2007 and
was conducted on 23 days ending on 30.09.2009 when the
written submissions of the two Parties were tendered.
The Applicant Party of the First Party (hereinafter
called and referred to as the Workman) stated that she had
joined the Party of the Second Part (hereinafter called
and referred to as the Bank) as a junior clerk/Cashier on
03.06.1974 until her forced retirement on 25.01.2006. The
workman said that in early 2003 applications were called
by the Bank to fill a vacancy in the position of Assistant
Manager Grade III Class 2 and said that she had satisfied all
the required qualifications for that post but had not been
selected.
The workman in her evidence  stated   that consequent to
her not being promoted to Grade  III    Class 2, the Respondent
Bank had called for her explanation in writing alleging that
she had failed to hand over originals of certain security
document to the Legal Officer belonging to a defaulting
customer, Globe Blenders and Bottlers Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., She
stated further that this incident had taken place in June/July
1997 when she was serving in the Recoveries Unit of the
Metropolitan Branch of the Respondent Bank.
continuing her evidence in chief she said that after a
purported inquiry the Respondent Bank had imposed
disciplinary orders, namely to severely reprimand her and
not to consider her eligible for promotion for a period
of 2 years from 19.08.2003, the date on which the Bank had
called for her explanation as aforesaid. The workman also
said that she had appealed against this order on two occasions
to the Bank but her appeals were not allowed.
The workman also said that she was deprived of any
promotions for a period of two years ending in August 2006
which went beyond the period of her optional retirement age
of 58 years and therefore had incurred a substantial financial
loss. She therefore sought reasonable compensation taking
into account the loss incurred because of the difference in
her salary and that of the position of the Assistant Manager,
compensation on account of her being denied almost 30
months of salary on the basis she could have earned as an
Assistant Manager and for other EPF, ETF, and other benefits
including the payment of gratuity and pension she would
have been justly entitled to. The workman gave evidence on
her own behalf and she was cross examined by the respondent
Bank.
According to the evidence of the workman the main
contention of the Respondent Bank had been that she had
alleged misplaced some vital security documents which were
necessary to file action against a defaulting customer of the
bank. In cross examination when the workman was shown
document R1, R1 ( a) and R1( b) she admitted that she had
written the endorsement in her hand writing but said that she
could not remember as to why she had written that remark.
The workman also said that the Bank procedure did not have
a system of acknowledgement of correspondence between
the staff of the Bank and therefore she had not obtained the
signature of the Senior Legal Officer when she handed over
the security document to her. However the workman marked
as  A15 and A16 documents which showed that the workman
had followed the “dual control” procedure of the Bank and
obtained the Indemnity Bond and other security documents
from the security vault.
The Respondent Bank led the evidence of the Senior
Legal Officer Ms. Gunasekera who said that the issue that
gave rise to the current industrial dispute was whether the
workman had misplaced certain documents marked by the
Bank as R5 and R7 which were copies of the said documents,
Witness Gunasekara pointed out that there were certain
inconsistencies in these in these documents and this would
not be the case had the originals been given to her. Witness
said in  evidence that she had asked the Manager Recoveries
for the originals of the Overdraft Agreement or the Indemnity
and the Guarantee, and when the Manager Recoveries had
instructed the Applicant Workman to hand over the
documents to the workman, she had told him that the original
documents had already been handed over to  witness but
upon further inquiry the workman was able to produce a copy
of the document marked A14 (and marked a R1 by the Bank)
which contained the remarks typed as “all documents are
originals”. Witness Gunasekera  said that this note in her
copy with the intention of showing that she had handed over
the original documents in question to the witness.
Witness Gunasekara also said that the Bank inquired into
the purported loss of these documents and found it was the

fault of the workman. Witness said that this proved by other
inquiries held at various level at the Bank. Witness contended
that the workman had taken a false position with regard to
the lost documents. Witness produced and marked as R23
the Register of Securities Delivered from the Vault in which
the signature of the workman appear. Witness Gunasekara
said that the security documents taken from the Vault by the
workman was never handed over to her and therefore the
total responsibility for the loss of the said documents is with
the workman.
CONCLUSION
The thrust of the argument of the Respondent Bank is
that the certain security documents need for filing action
against a defaulting customer, Glove Blenders and Bottlers
Lanka Ltd had been misplaced or lost due to the careless
handling of these documents by the workman. It has to be
pointed out however that the Bank through its main witness
Gunasekara failed to prove that the documents were lost and/
or misplaced and it was due to the carelessness or negligence
of the workman. Also though the witness of the Bank
contended that the workman had altered the records, this
was also not proved.
Secondly, the purported loss is supposed to have taken
place in June/July 1997 but the so called disciplinary inquiry
into the purported loss was held in 2001 after a loss of nearly
4 years. This only speaks of some prejudice against the
workman which reeks of unfair and unacceptable conduct.
The decision of the Disciplinary Committee is flawed as
there was a lapse of several years before investigations were
conducted to determine whether there had been an actual
loss. The purported inquiry had been held by a so called
disciplinary committee which consisted of the high ranking
officials of the Bank. In such matter, the Bank should have
had an independent inquiry officer to investigate and give
them a reasoned out result of the inquiry. Nothing of that
nature has happened and the vital rule of law “audi alteram
partem” has been violated. In the premises, the conclusion
of the disciplinary committee cannot be accepted.
Though the Respondent Bank claimed that the remark made
in R1(a), “All documents are originals” had been done by the
workman to give herself an alibi, the Bank failed to prove its
contention by calling in evidence  the Chief Manager
Recoveries who could have testified on this matter and to
other matters initiated by the Chief Recoveries Manager and
marked as R1, R2 and R4.
With regard to the workman’s claim that she could have
worked up to the compulsory age of retirement - 58 years - it
would have been a reasonable expectation at the time she
joined the service of the bank.
In the light of the evidence recorded from both the workman
and the bank, it appears that there seems to have been a
thread of prejudice against the workman and all the actions
of the bank appear to point in that direction. For example the
lapse of almost 4 years before the matter of the missing
documents were discovered and a explanation sought from
the workman. Also the holding of the inquiry also took a long
time while the workman was suspended from service. This
led to the loss of her prospects of promotion though she was
qualified for the higher position in the Bank.
AWARD
Taking into consideration the evidence led by the applicant
workman and the respondent bank and on a balance
probabilities I make the following award  to the Applicant
workman in the following manner :
1.  The non granting of the promotion to Grade III Class 2
is not justified. It was seen in evidence that the workman was
eminently qualified for the promotion where even those
who had lesser qualifications and experience had been
promoted. The workman had been retired on 25.01.2006 while
she had 2 years and 3 months to reach the compulsory age of
retirement.
2.  That the non granting of service to the workman by the
respondent bank is unjustified and therefore she is entitled
to the said promotion to the position of Assistant Manager
in Grade III Class 2. In the premises I award that she be
promoted to Grade III Class 2 of the bank’s service and
be promoted accordingly to the position of Assistant
Manager ;
3. That the workman be placed on an appropriate point
on the revised salary scale (2006 - 2008) for the period from
1997 to the age of retirement.
Accordingly I direct the payment of arrears of salary for
the workman be deposited with the Commissioner of Labour
Colombo Central and the granting of the promotion be
finalized and awarded within one (01) month of the publication
of this Award in the Government Gazette of the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
