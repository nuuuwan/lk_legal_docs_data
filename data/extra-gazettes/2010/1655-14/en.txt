The Hon.  Minister   by  virtue of the powers vested in him
by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes    Act,  Chapter 131
of the Legislative Enactment of Ceylon 1936   ( Revised
Edition) as amended  by Act, Nos. 14 of 1957,  4 of 1962 and
39 of 1968, (read with   Industrial Disputes (Special
Provisions)  Act,  No. 37  of 1968), appointed me as the
Arbitrator by his order dated 25.05.2007 and referred the
following  dispute to me for   Arbitration.
THE  AW ARD
The matters in dispute has arisen between (1) R. A. R. M.
Ranawaka, Superintendent, Galphilla State Plantation,
Panwila; and (2) D. K. Benedict, Superintendent, Rangala
State Plantation, Rangala of the one part (Applicants) and Sri
Lanka State Plantation Corporation, No. 55/75, Vauxhall Lane,
Colombo 02 of the other part (Respondent).
The maters in dispute are :-
1 . In view of the recruitment procedure of
Superintendent of Sri Lanka State Plantation
Corporation whether any discrepancy in salary was
caused to Messrs. R. A. R. M. Ranawaka and
D. K. Benedict who were Superintendents of the said
Corporation ; and
2. If any such salary discrepancy was caused, what
should be the salary scale payable to R. A. R. M.
Ranawaka and D. K. Benedict as from 01st March,
2004 and whether they are entitled to receive arrears
of salary accordingly.
Appearances :
At the inquiry before the Arbitrator which began on
22.08.2007 the applicants Messrs. Ranawaka and Benedict
Superintendents, SLSPC were represented by Mr. Saliya
Edirisinghe, Attorney-at-Law who withdrew from the case
on 12.09.2007. Thereafter  Mr. K. G . Nawarathna represented
the applicants. The Respondent SLSPC was represented by
Mr. Susantha Gunasekera, Attorney-at-Law. Applicant
Ranawaka gave evidence on his behalf. The evidence on
behalf of the respondent SLSPC was given by M/s.
Chandra Liyange, Regional Directress, Kandy and
Ms. Vinitha Beneragama, Assistant Managress, SLSPC.
The 2nd applicant D. K. Benedict having come to a
settlement with the respondent SLSPC withdrew from the
case  (No. A - 3215) on 04.08.2008 and produced the terms of
settlement marked R. 14 whereby he was to be paid 7
increments which had been held up, for the period
01.07.2001 to 01.07.2008, without arrears and was placed on
the new salary point Rs. 44,805 p.m. on the revised salary
scale - 25,640-3x665–07x735—15x925 —Rs. 46,665 - w.e.f.
01.07.2008. Since Superintendent Benedict has already
withdrawn from this inquiry, we shall refrain from dealing
with the merits of his application and in the course of making
our order we shall make reference to his case if the
necessity arises.
The compliant of the two applicants :
The aforesaid two applicants, in their statement to this
Tribunal complained that filling vacant posts of
Superintendents, referring to the appointment of
Superintendents Tennege and Wadugodapitiya from
outside the SLSPC and placing them on the highest salary
point in Grade II of the Superintendent’s scale has caused
discontentment, frustration and low moral among the
long-standing Superintendents of the SLSPC, who have been
serving the respondent SLSPC with dedication. They also
alleged that this procedure of recruitment is irregular,
unreasonable,  unfair, unjust and  inequitable to the
Superintendents already in employment with the SLSPC.
Superintendent Ranawaka’s claim :
The basis of Superintendent Ranawaka’s claim is that
his present salary is Rs. 15,225 in Grade III and the newly
appointed Superintendents have been placed on Rs.21,610
the maximum of Grade II which he considers as an anomaly
and in order to rectify this perceived anomaly, Ranawaka
claims (by A8) that he should be placed on par with the salaries
of the new recruits (Tennege, Wadugodapitiya) as he had
joined the SLSPC earlier.
Reference  has been made to the recruitment procedure of
Superintendents. No evidence was placed before us and we
are anaware of any existing scheme of recruitment and the
procedure that had been followed in the SLSP/JEDB in the
past and hence unable to comment on it. We have however,
been able to give all details of the recruitment procedure
followed in 2002 in the recruitment of the two new
superintendents Messrs Tennege and Wadugodapitiya.
Recruitments of the Superintendents in 2002 :
In the year 2002 the Board has followed accepted
procedure in the recruitment of the two new Superintendents
by giving the widest publicity in 2 English Sunday
Newspapers the “Observer” and “Sunday Leader” and a
Sunday Sinhala paper “The Lakbima” (R(5),  R(6) and R(7)) to
fill the vacancy of the post of Superintendent. The
requirements were :

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 26.05.2010
3A
(a) Educational  :  GCE (O/L) with Arithmetic and Maths.
(b) Experience : 15 years planting experience with 5 years
as Superintendent.
(c) Age :  40 years.
(d) Salary : To be placed at a suitable point in Grade II
according to experience.
The Respondent Board, having considered R(9) the
Bio data of M.I.P. Tennege of St. James Estate, Haliella and
R(10) Bio data of Y . A. T. B. Wadugodapitiya of Hugoland
Estate, Welimada whose qualifications, experience and
professional career records were impressive, were selected
for the posts of Superintendents. In addition to all the
other requirement both of them also had passed the G. C. E.
(Advanced Level) although the educaitonal qualification
request was only  G .C.E.  (O/L). Although the required age
limit was 40 years, Tennege’s age of 37 years has not been
counted as an impediment. They were selected and placed
on the maximum salary point of Grade II. This salary placement
was in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the
news  paper advertisements R5, R6 and R7 where the selected
candidate was “
to be placed at a suitable point in Grade II,
according to experience”.
On complaints made to the respondent Board by the 2
applicants about the selection of a Superintendent from
outside, the Chairman SLSPC/JEDB by his letter R12 of
14.02.2004 has ordered the 4  following Superintendents :-
1 . RARM Ranawake, Superintendent, Galpihilla
(Applicant),
2. K. G . Gunaratna, Superintendent, Hagalla,
3. T. F. S. Fernando, Superintendent, Kellebokka,
4. D. K. Benedict, Superintendent, Ranagala (Applicant).
be placed on a salary Rs. 21,610 p.m. being the maximum of
Grade II w.e.f. from 01.03.2004 and the only reason given for
such an order is, in the Chairman’s own words :-
“Consequent to the visit made by the undersigned
(Chairman SLSPC/JEDB) during the 1st week of
February 2004 I hereby request you to grant the following
increments”. (R12).
This order places the above 4 Superintendents on the
same salary point to which Superintendents Tennege and
Wadugodapitiya were appointed in the year 2002 to the
SLSPC and does not disclose the reason why this order was
made. This order R12 is an ill considered and hastily made
order equating all 4 Superintendents thus creating more
anomalies in their salaries and seniority visa vis , between
Superintendents Benedict and Ranawaka. This order, which
affects 4 Superintendents of varying seniority, has been
made without considering each case on its own merit.
Superintendent Benedict by his seniority had a salary
difference of Rs. 955 p.m. over the salary drawn by
Superintendent Ranawake. The order in R12 placed both of
them on the maximum of Grade II thus, removing the salary
difference and placed both Benedict and Ranawaka on the
same seniority thereby unjustly and arbitrarily removing the
seniority of Benedict. This is a glaring anomaly resulting
from the order R12. The order 2 Superintendents Messrs.
Gunaratna and Fernnando whose names are included in the
Chairman’s order R12, were not parties to this inquiry and we
are unable to comment how this order had affected them.
When the order in R12 pushed up Ranawaka to the
maximum of Grade II, his substantive salary in 2004 was
Rs. 15,685 which was one step below the maximum of
Grade III (R11J). Before reaching the maximum of Grade II,
Ranawaka had a long way to go ; he had to earn one more
increment in Grade III and earn 10 increments in Grade II
which under normal circumstances would have taken another
10 years to reach the maximum of Grade II which probably
would be in the year 2015. In the year 2005 by a Salary Revision
(R11L) the employees of SLSPC/JEDB were benefited and
Ranawaka in 2006 (R11M) was drawing a monthly salary of
Rs. 32,715 and continued to draw the enhanced salary and
increments annually, uninterrupted. Taking cover under the
ill considered order made in R12,  Ranawaka has claimed
arrears of salary (A19) from the year 2004 to the year 2007 in
a staggering sum of Rs. 464,415.50 which is a spurious claimed
that does not deserve consideration as he has throughout
this period been drawing his substantive salary.
As indiscriminate awards of increments have been made,
it is necessary to append below relevant extracts from the
Establishment Code — CR VII p. 69 (R15).
“An officer is not entitled to draw an increment as of
right. He is required to earn it by the efficient and
diligent discharge of his duties and by serving the
increment period in full. A certificate to that effect
should be signed by the appropriate authority before
an increment is paid”.
During the period Parliament was dissolved and in the
absence of the Board, the General Manager SLSPC/JEDB
who was also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) acting under
the powers vested in him withdrew the indiscriminate
increments granted to the 4 Superintendents by the then
Chairman, by his directions made in R12, by informing

applicant Ranawaka by (A10) on 10.05.2004 about the
withdrawal of the increments which had placed him on
maximum of Grade II. Consequently he was reverted back to
the salary point of Rs. 15,225/- in Grade III. This was done in
conformity with the directions issued by Circular A11 of
02.02.2004 issued by the Presidential Secretariat. for all intents
and purpose the salary point Ranawaka had been placed by
R12 conforms to the definition of the word “promotion” and
could be construed as a subtle attempt to circumvent the real
intent and purpose of circular (A11) of 02.02.2004. In
withdrawing Ranawaka’s increments, the CEO had also taken
the serious financial crisis the SLSPC/JEDB was facing, into
consideration, in making his order.
On the protests made by Superintendent Ranawaka on
the withdrawal of his increments by A10, to the Asst.
Commissioner of Labour, Kandy who after an inquiry made a
directive to the SLSP by A15 on 02.09.2005 that the salary
anomalies of the Superintendents should be removed but
fails to state specifically what the anomalies are. He points
out the salaries drawn by Superintendents Benedict and
Ranawaka and compares the salaries drawn by the two
Superintendents recruited from outside the SLSPC in the year
2002, on a higher salary scale but is unaware of the conditions
under which the latter two were recruited to the SLSPC
(vide R5, R6, R7). This recruitment had been done under
proper and regular recruitment procedure being followed, with
utmost transparency observed Mrs. Liyanage, Regional
Directress the witness for the respondent before the inquiry
A15 has only admitted that there were different salary scale
for these Superintendents and does not agree with the
accuracy of the proceedings in A15, in her evidence before
us. In failing to take into consideration the background leading
to the appointment of two Superintendents from outside
namely Teenege and Wadugodapitiya, this inquiry A15 is
misleading, inconclusive and of no value.
As Superintendents Benedict and Ranawaka initiated this
inquiry (1R/19/04/2006) by their complaints, it is appropriate
to mention here that :-
(a) Superintendent Benedict has had a very commendable
record as a planter as seen from the documents place
before this inquiry. He also had all the qualifications
necessary to apply when application were called from
outside by R5, R6, R7. As to why he failed to apply in
response to the widely advertised vacancies is
inexplicable.
(b) Superintendent Ranawaka too has placed evidence
before this inquiry which shows that he has a
commendable record of service though he lacked
seniority as he had only 6 years and 10 months service
at the time applications were called in the year 2002
vide (R5, R6, R7) which required 15 years experience
and 5 years as Superintendent.
Taking into consideration all the evidence, documents
and the circumstances, the answer to the matter in
dispute are :
(1) The recruitment of two Superintendents from outside
for employment in the SLSPC in 2002 did not cause
any discrepancy in salary to Messrs R. A. R. M.
Ranawaka and DT Benedict, who were
Superintendents of the said corporation and,
(2) As no salary discrepancy was caused, the salary they
were drawing has been paid them with regularity. The
claim made by Superintendent Ranakwa for arrears of
salary in Rs. 464,415.50 has no basis and is hereby
rejected.
I consider this award just and equitable.

AWARD
The Applicant Party of the 1st Part stated that Manager
of the Chilaw branch of the Respondent  Bank of the
Second Part had complained that the Applicant had on
21.08.2001 had insulted him in bad language in the presence
of the other staff of the Bank. When the Bank receive this
complaint a preliminary inquiry was held into the complaint
by the Chief Accountant of the Bank, and based on his report
a charge sheet was issued to the applicant and he was
interdicted from service on 28.08.2001.
The Applicant also stated that a formal inquiry was
held by the Respondent Bank and he was found guilty of
charge 4 and part 1 of Charge 1. The Applicant states that
the Inquiry Officer had not specified as to which part of
charge 1 he had been made guilty of, and also in charge 4
he had been found guilty of damaging the good name of the
Bank by his behaviour specified in charges I to III of the said
charge sheet. The Applicant pleads that these findings are
not clear and therefore he should not have been interdicted
on  this report.
The Applicant also states that on or about 16.12.2002 he
was awarded the following punishments :
(i) That the Applicant would not be paid his salary
during the period of interdiction ;
(ii) That he is severely reprimanded ; and
(iii) That he would be transferred out of the Chilaw branch.
The Applicant states that he made several appeals to
the Board of Directors of the Bank but no changes to the
punishments were made except that the word “reprimand”
was changed to “warning” and to pay half month’s salary
per month during the period of interdiction.
Applicant states that he made a complaint to the
Human Right Commission but to no avail. Applicant
also states that the Bank took almost one year and four
months to complete the inquiry and thereby his chances
of a promotion and salary increment were illegally denied to
him by the Bank.
In the circumstances the Applicant prays that he be paid
the salary for the period of interdiction, his transfer out of
Chilaw should be stopped and that the annual  salary
increments due to him of the period 2000 and 2001 should be
paid to him and that he should be awarded the due promotions
which he would have earned if he had not been unjustly and
unfairly interdicted from service while in the Bank.

The Respondent  Party of the Second Part (hereinafter
known as the Respondent Bank)  admits that while the
Applicant was working in the Chilaw branch of the
Respondent  Bank there had been a complaint form the
Manager of the Bank that the Applicant had insulted him
using unparliamentary language in the presence of the staff.
The  Respondent Bank states that as a consequence they
held a preliminary inquiry and a charge sheet was issued and
a formal inquiry was held into the charges by an independent
Inquiry Officer. The Bank stated that as a result of the
recommendations of the Inquiry where the Applicant was
found guilty of charge 4 and part of charge 1 of the said
charge he was awarded the following punishments ie that he
would not be paid a salary for the period of interdiction, that
he is severely reprimanded and that the Applicant would be
transferred out of the Chilaw branch of the Bank.
The Bank also admits that the Applicant made several
appeals to the Board of the Bank but the Bank only reduced
the reprimand to a warning and agreed to pay half month’s
salary for each month during the period of interdiction.
In the premises the Bank prays that the Bank followed the
proper disciplinary procedure in holding then Inquiry and
awarding the punishments and therefore it is not agreeable
to any change of the punishment awarded to the Applicant
and that it cannot retain the Applicant in the Chilaw branch
of the Bank for disciplinary reasons.
The Bank therefore prays that the complaint of the
Applicant be dismissed.

The Inquiry into the said arbitration commenced
on 21.09.2007 and was concluded on 11.09.2009, and written
submissions were tendered by both Parties.
The Applicant Party stated in evidence that a baseless
complaint was made against him by the Manager of the
Chilaw branch of the Respondent Bank to the effect that he
had used insulting words on the Manager in the presence
of the staff of the Bank on 21.08.2001. The Applicant stated
that his mother had been ill for a long time and had been
hospitalized and at that time she had been brought to his
home.  He said that since both his wife and he were at work
he had told his mother to telephone him regarding her
condition. On that particular day he had received a few calls
and one was from his mother, but the Manager had not called
him to the telephone, which was on the table of the Manager.
The Applicant said that he had argued with the Manager
about not giving  him the call from his ailing mother, but
denied he used insulting or obscene words at the Manager.
Thereafter the Bank had held a preliminary inquiry about the
usage of obscene words on the Manager by the Applicant,
and based on the preliminary inquiry, a charge sheet was
issued to him and his services were interdicted with effect
from 28.08.2001.
The Applicant stated further that a formal inquiry was
held by an independent inquiry officer and as a consequence,
he had been found guilty of part of charge 1 and charge 4 of
the charges sheet. he said that he had not been found
guilty of charges 2 and 3 of the said charge sheet.
Accordingly, he had been awarded with the following
punishments i.e.  no salary payment for the period of
interdiction ; that he was severely reprimanded ; and he was
also to be transferred out of  the Chilaw branch of the Bank.
The Applicant said that he had appealed that Board of
Directors on 3 separate occasions asking for relief by the
Board had merely changed the term “severe reprimand” to
serve warning” and also  to pay half month’s salary per month
for the period of interdiction from 28.08.2001 to 15.12.2002.
Applicant also said that he made representations to the
Human Rights Commission but to no avail.
The Applicant also said that the Bank had taken more
than one year and four months before the Bank took the
decision to communicate the findings of the Inquiry to him
and therefore there was no time for him to apply for his
increments for 06.07.2000 and 06.07.2001 in terms of the
provisions of the Administrative Circular No. 6 of 1998 dated
27.08.1998.
The Applicant stated that he had not been granted his
due promotion and the method followed by the Bank in
awarding marks to him as a candidate for promotion was unfair
and unreasonable.
The Respondent Bank  took up the position that the
Applicant had insulted the Manager of the Chilaw
Branch, Mr. W. F. M. Fernando and consequently a
preliminary inquiry was held by the Chief Accountant of the
Bank and later a charge sheet was issued on those
findings and a formal Inquiry was held into those charges
by an independent inquiry officer. The bank stated that
the formal inquiry which took some time to be completed
found the Applicant guilty of charge 4 and part of charge 1
of the charge sheet. Accordingly the Bank awarded
punishments in that no salary was to be paid for the
period of interdiction, that the Applicant be severely
reprimanded and that he be transferred out of the Chilaw
branch of the Bank.

The Bank admitted that though the Applicant had applied
to the Board of the Bank to review the punishments on two
occasions, the Board had only agreed to change the words
“severe reprimand” to “severe warning” and to pay half
month’s salary per month for the period of interdiction.
The Bank also said that the Applicant had failed to
apply for his increments in accordance with
Administrative Circular No. 6 of 1998 and thereby
forfeited his chances of getting increments for the period
06.07.2000 and 06.07.2001.
AWARD
Both Parties admit that there had been an exchange
of words between the Applicant and the Manager of the
Chilaw branch of the Bank, and consequently, the
Applicant had been interdicted  for over a period of 12
months before the Bank awarded the punishment in terms of
the findings of the formal inquiry.
The report of the inquiry itself appears vague in its
terminology. The charge sheet speaks of 4 charges, and
charges 2 and 3 appear to the consequences arising from
charge 1. The Report does not specify as to which part of
charge 1 the Applicant is guilty of since charge 1 is not
in two parts. Further the inquiry officer had said that
the Applicant is not guilty of charges 2 and 3 and guilty of
charge 4 only. It is my considered view that the inquiry
officer engaged by the Bank for holding this inquiry is
not a person who has understood the charges, and further,
the charge sheet drawn up by the Bank is also not clear
and specific.
However, considering the evidence  led and  on a balance
of probabilities, I find  that since the Applicant had been
found guilty of charge 4 and part of charge 1 and reinstated
in service, he is entitled to the payment of full salary for the
period he had been under  interdiction. The Bank has
also to take the responsibility for having delayed the
inquiry for over one and a half years during which the
Applicant had to be without his salary.
I  am  also of the opinion that the “severe warning” should
be deleted from the Personal file of the Applicant.
However I agree with the Bank that the Applicant
should be transferred from the Chilaw branch for reasons of
discipline.
with regard to the non payment of the two increments
for 06.07.2000 and 06.07.2001 the Administrative Circular
No. 6/1998 clearly spells out the procedure for    the application
for increments. The Applicant had not been under
interdiction during the period 06.07.2000 and 06.07.2001 and
there is no reason why he should have not applied for his
increments, except carelessness. Hence he is not entitled to
the increments for these two years.
With regard to the non granting of promotions, it is clear
that the Applicant had been one of the applicants for
promotions and on examining the mark sheets of the Interview
Board, I do not find any prejudice as alleged by the Applicant
against him. Therefore the Bank is reasonable and justified in
not granting    the promotion to the Applicant though he was
reinstated  in service.
In this premises I make the following Award in respect
of  the reference sent to me by the Hon. Minister in that :
1. That the full salary at the rate of salary paid at the
time of interdiction of the Applicant be paid for the
period of interdiction to the Applicant by the
Wayamba Bank within one month of the publication
of this Award in the Sri Lanka Government Gazette
and the money to be deposited with the Commissioner
of Labour Chilaw ;
2. That the words “severe warning” be deleted from the
Personal File of the Applicant within one month of
the publication of this Award in the Sri Lanka
Government Gazette :
3. That the Wayamba Bank is justified and reasonable
in transferring the Applicant from the Chilaw branch
for disciplinary reasons ;
4. That the Wayamba Bank is justified and reasonable
in not granting annual increments to the Applicant
for the two years 06.07.2000 and 06.07.2001 ;
5. That the Wayamba Bank is justified and reasonable
in not granting promotions in service to the Applicant
after reinstatement.

11. Provident Fund
I. Rates of Contribution
The rates of contribution to the provident Fund by the Bank as at the date of this Agreement which are as
follows shall continue in force subject to the rules of the Provident Fund :
Bank’s  Contribution - 12% (Twelve percent) of Consolidated Basic Salary
Emplyee’s Contribution - 8% (Eight percent) of Consolidated Basic Salary.
II. Interest on Provident Fund Contribution Held by the Bank

of the General Membership whenever it is deemed necessary in order to decide on suitable investments of the Fund
and the returns from time to time.
III. Deficiency in Bank’ s Contributions to Provident Fund to an Employee Not Entitled to a Pension.
A
PPLICABLE TO THOSE EMPLOYEES NAMED IN SCHEDULE 3
Where an employee shall cease to be employed by the Bank in circumstances which do not entitle him to a pension
or payment in lieu of pension, as the case may be, such employee shall be entitled to the difference between the Bank’s
contribution made to the Fund during his period of service and the Employer’s minimum  rate of contribution he would
have been entitled to, in terms of the Employees Provident fund Act and its amendments from time to time as a contribution
to the fund by the Employer on behalf of such employee. Such deficiency will be the difference between the following
minimum rates of contribution under the Act and consolidated basic salary actually contributed by the Bank—
From 01.01.81 to 30.09.91,  12% of gross salary.
Prior to 31.12.80 the Employer’s minimum rate of contribution was 9% of total earnings (gross salary) which
was less than 10% of consolidated basic salary and therefore no deficiency arises.
The rate of contribution by the Bank, increased from 10% to 12% of gross salary with effect from 1st October, 1991
and therefore non deficiency arises thereafter.
Accordingly, deficiency in Provident Fund- Employer’s Contribution will only arise in respect of the period
01.01.81 to 30.09.91 and will be computed by dividing the aggregate employer’s contribution during this period
by 10 and multiplying same by 2 to make good the 2% deficiency.
A
PPLICABLE TO THOSE EMPLOYEES NAMED IN SCHEDULE 2
Where an employee shall cease to be employed by the Bank in circumstances which do not entitle him to a pension
or payment in lieu of pension as the case may be, such employee shall be entitled to the difference between the Bank’s
contributions made to the Fund during his period of service and the employer’s minimum rate of contribution he would have
been entitled to, in terms of the Employee’s Provident Fund Act and its amendments from time to time as a Contribution to the
Fund by the employer on behalf of such employee. Such deficiency will be the difference between the following minimum
rates of contribution under the Act and 10% of basic salary actually contribution by the Banks up to 31st March, 1992.

From 1.1.71 to 31.12.20 9% of gross salary
From 1.1.81 onwards 12% of gross salary
Prior to 31.12.70 the employer’s minimum rate of contribution was 6% of total earnings (gross salary) which was less
than 10% of basic salary and therefore no deficiency arises.
12. Terminal Benefits
I. Pensions
The Bank operates two pension Schemes.
One Scheme is as fully described in 1(a) below (hereinafter called the “SCB Pension Scheme”) will
govern the pension benefits of the employees whose names are set out in Schedule 2 hereto.
The other scheme fully described in 1(b) below, (hereinafter called the SCGB Pension Scheme”), will
govern the pension benefits of the employees whose names are setout in Schedule 3 hereto.
All current employees at 31st January, 2010, who qualify for a pension, will be governed either by the
SCB or SCGB pension scheme.
With the objective of having a unified pension scheme for all employees, the Bank intends to introduce
a uniform Pension Scheme in the future. Subject to the operation of the two pension schemes described above, the
Bank and the Union agrees to have discussions during the pendency of this Agreement and agree on the introduction
of the uniform Pension Scheme to employees covered under this agreement.
Subject to agreement being reached, the existing employees who are governed by the SCB or SCGB pension
scheme may opt to transfer to the new pension scheme on it’s introduction. All new employees recruited subsequent
to the introduction of the new Pension Scheme will be enrolled in that scheme, as expressly stated in their terms of employment.
(a) SCGB Pension Scheme (Applicable to employees listed in Schedule 3)
(i)    Pension - Retirement.
An employee shall, upon reaching the age of retirement, i.e. 55 years and who is in the permanent employment
of the Bank at such time and shall have completed not less than 10 years of actual continuous service (excluding
absence/leave without pay), be entitled to a pension computed on the following basis, provided however, than an
employee between the age of 50 and 55 years, who shall have completed not less than 10 years or service, in the manner
referred to above, may opt to retire, subject however, to granting the Bank the stipulated period of notice of retirement.
Number of Completed years service Monthly salary payable for the
(max 35 years) plus 5 x month of retirement + COLA
                     60
(ii) Pension - Premature Retirement on Medical Grounds/Disability.
An employee, who is found to be unable to continue to perform his or her duties as a result of infirmity/disability
as certified by the Bank’s doctor/Medical Specialist/Government Medical Board, and who is in the permanent employment
of the Bank at such time, and shall have completed not less than 10 years of actual continuous service (excluding
absence/leave without pay) shall be entitled to a Pension computed on the same basis referred to at Clause 12 I a(i) above,
Provided, however, that where an employee is entitled to compensation by the Bank under any laws in force at the time
or an Award of Court, such employee shall only be entitled to a Pension or such compensation as opted by him or her,

but not to both. Provided further, that in the case of any employee whose premature retirement occurred in consequence of
an accident which entitled him to compensation, the pre-acceptance of Pensions as provided herein, will not restrict the right
of such employee in subsequently claiming any balance compensation, under any written law.
(iii)  commutation of Pension - In Lieu of Pension Rights.
An employee who is entitled to receive a pension in terms of Clause 12 I (a) (i) & 12 I (a)(ii) above may at his
discretion opt for the payment of a commutation of pension in lieu of his pension rights.
The payment will be computed on the following basis ;
Number of Completed years service X 2 x (Monthly salary payable for the
(max. 35 years) plus 5 month of retirement + COLA)
The above payment shall constitute a settlement in full and final satisfaction of all claims against the Bank on
