Notes  - General
1. Any Employee is allowed to work in a different location if there is no work available in the first operation he was
involved, he can complete his day’s norms in the second operation and earn incentive.
Example :
At  Department 122 B
Available No. of sides for Sammying of re-tanned leather is 300 sides.
After finishing the above 300 sides, he can go to Toggle drying operation, complete his days norms and earn
incentive.
Calculation of day’s norms to be completed as below :
% worked at the Sammying operation = No. of pieces done/day’s norms x 100 (300 / 693) 43.30 %
The balance to be completed at Toggling 56.70 %
Therefore,  No. of pieces to be Toggled to achieve the day’s norms 159 Sides
2. If an Employee has achieved his day’s norms and incentive by working in one or more operation still he can
go to any other operation and earn incentive.

Notes  - General
1. Any Employee is allowed to work in a different location if there is no work available in the first operation he was
involved. he can complete his days norms in the second operation and earn incentive.
Example :
At  Department 122 B
Available No. of sides for Sammying of re-tanned leather is 300 sides
After finishing the above 300 sides he can go to Toggle drying operation, complete his days norm and earn
incentive.
Calculation of days norm to be completed as below.
% worked at the Sammying operation = No. of pieces done/days norm X 100 (300 / 693) 43.30%
The balance to be completed at toggling 56.70%
Therefore No. of pieces to be Toggled to achieve the days norm 159 Sides
2. If an employee has achieved his days norm and incentive by working in one or more operation still  he can go to any
other operation and earn incentive.
