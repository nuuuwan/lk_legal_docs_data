The matter in dispute between  the aforesaid parties are :-
“Whether the demand made from the Lanka Ashok
Leyland Limited by Mr. S. A. V . Gunaratne who is
employed as a casual employee of the Company since
03.07.1994 that he be made permanent in the service
taking into account of his continuous service at the
Company is justified and if justified, from which date he should
be granted permanency in service.”
Appearances :
Mr. Dhanya Gunawardena Attorney-at-Law appeared for
the Respondent with Mr. Manjula Perera, Administrative
Executive for the Respondent . Mr. Newton Uswatte, Attorney-
at-Law appeared for the workman. He was present.
Evidence was led by the Respondent and the letter of
appointment issued to the workman by the Respondent
making him  permanent from 01.01.2010 was produced on
07.01.2010. discussions ensued for sometime on the letter of
appointment issued to the workman making him permanent
from 01.01.2010 and it was pointed out that there are certain
areas where clarification was required from the Respondent.
It was agreed to make available on 3rd February, 2010 the
decision of the Respondent in  relation to the date from which
the applicant was to be made permanent.
On 03.02.2010 it was observed that a motion has been filed
by the workman stating that he is no longer interested in
continuing the arbitration proceedings and the said arbitration
proceedings be terminated forthwith. It is stated in this motion
that this fact has been duly informed to the Respondent and
also to his Legal Representative Mr. Newton Uswatta.
Mr. Dhanya Gunawardena Attorney-at-Law for the
Respondent was present on 03.02.2010 along with Mr. Manjula
Perera, Administrative Executive and confirmed the contents
of the motion. The workman was absent.
In these circumstances I do not want to proceed further. I
therefore make no award.
