20.4 Employees will not be eligible for PSS on a pro-rated basis.

20.5 Payment under the PSS applicable to new recruits employed after 1st April, 2010 will be the difference between the
payment under PSS, as given in 20.3 above, and Rs. 25,000/-.
20.6 Provided, however, during the operation of this agreement, eligible employees who were recruited before 01st April, 2010 and

terms of clauses 18.2 and 18.3 above. If the payment under PSS is higher than Rs. 25,000/- payable in terms of clauses 18.2
and 18.3 above, such employees would receive the guaranteed payment of Rs. 25,000/- in terms of clauses 18.2 and 18.3
above and the difference between the payment under PSS and the said Rs. 25,000/- payable in terms of Clauses 18.2 and
18.3 above.
For e.g. if the company were to achieve a profit of Rs. 360 million, and since the corresponding payout in terms of the PSS
is Rs. 30,000/- the Company would pay the difference between the PSS and the lump sum, i.e. a sum of Rs. 5,000/- as profit
share, plus the lump sum of Rs. 25,000/- (or Rs. 30,000/- in the case of financial year 2012/13) in terms of clauses 18.2 and
18.3 hereof to eligible employees.

paid as an advance of this payment to the new recruits recruited after 1st April, 2010, on the 5th April, 2013, from the payment
due in May 2013.
20.8 It is the intention of parties continue the Profit Share Scheme and requisite revisions to the PSS shall be made with the
concurrence of the Union.
20.9 Payment under the PSS, if eligible to pay, and the sum set out in 18.2  will be made on or before 31st May every year.
21. Wages for Periods Less Than One Month:– For the purpose of this Agreement the wages of any Employee for periods less
than one month shall be computed in the manner following:

21.2 For one day – the monthly wage divided by thirty (30).
21.3 For one–half - a days wage ascertained as above divided by two (2) (either morning or afternoon).
21.4 For one week – a day's wage ascertained as above multiplied by seven (7).
22. Provident Fund:– The Employer shall contribute to the Provident Fund 12% of the Employees' monthly salary and the Employee
shall contribute like sum to the Fund. The rates of contribution are liable to change subject to the requirements of the Employees' Provident
Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958.
23. Annual Increments:– The annual increments provided in each of the scales of consolidated wages in the Schedule hereto shall
be automatic unless as a matter of punishment for general inefficiency including irregular attendance or punctuality or disciplinary action on
account of serious misconduct an increment is suspended, stopped, deferred, in which case where an increment is–
23.1 deferred, the loss of increment shall be continuous throughout the year;
23.2 stopped, the loss of increment shall only be for the period of stoppage during the year;
23.3 suspended, the increment is suspended pending a decision to defer or stop an increment, such decision being dependent upon
a consideration of the factors giving rise to the suspension where on such decision an increment is neither stopped nor deferred,
then the suspension shall be treated as waived and the full increment from the date of suspension thereof shall accrue to the
Employee concerned. Deferment, stoppage or suspension of an increment shall only be effected in cases where the employee
has been notified in writing of a complaint against such Employee and has been found guilty after due inquiry of inefficiency
fraud or misconduct, which in the circumstances does not merit termination of employment.
