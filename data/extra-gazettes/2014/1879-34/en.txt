2. Appearances :
Mrs. Tashya Gajanayaka Attorney-at-Law from
Attorney General's Department
Mrs. P. M. A. A. Muhandaram Executive Officer of the
board was present.
Mr. Janake Adhikari Attorney-at-Law appeared for the
workman who was present.
3. Background Facts :
There was an incident on 11.10.2009 whereat K. S.
Munasinghe conductor of Negombo Depot on duty in
route No. 240 from Negombo to Colombo was assaulted
and the money was taken away. The amount of money
is not stated in the statement of dispute referred to me.
It states “A portion of the salary” was deducted from
him. It transpired during the course of the Arbitration
proceedings that a sum of Rs. 8,349 was recovered from
his salary. It was suggested by me that the amount
being small it would be prudent to settle the dispute.
The respondent board kept on saying that there was a
possibility of settlement and finally said it was not
prepared to settle it. The evidence in chief of M. N. L.
Fernando Chief Security Inspector Negombo Depot was
given by way of an affidavit by the board. He was
cross examined by the learned council for the workman
and thereafter re-examined. The workman K. S.
Munasinghe gave evidence and he was cross examined
by the learned council for the board and thereafter he
was re-examined. Both parties have tendered written
submissions.
4. Issues to be determined :
i. Was a proper internal disciplinary inquiry
conducted by the respondent board ?
ii. Has the workman been negligent in his duty on
11.10.2009 as claimed by the respondent board ?
iii. Has the workman caused the loss of Rs. 8,349 to
the board ?
iv. Is the deduction of Rs. 8,349 from the salary of
the workman by the board justified or not ?
v. Is the workman entitled to any relief and if so
what ?
5. Analysis of evidence :
In order to answer the issues to be determined I am
doing an analysis of the evidence available before me.
M. L. N. Fernando the witness of the respondent board
has under cross examination stated that the workman
was assaulted by a passenger who had robbed the
money from the workman - page 51 of the proceedings
of 14.10.2013. He has also stated under cross
examination as follows :
I. The passenger had stolen from the workman Rs.
8,349.
II. The workman had complained to the police
immediately and he was admitted to Negombo
government hospital where he found the
workman.
III. The workman was not given the facilities to keep
the money which he had collected from the
passengers - page 52.
IV . It is the duty of the conductor to keep the money
in his pocket which is safe than inside the ticket
book - page 53
V. The  questions posed to him by me -
    Q. : Is there any guideline in writing issued to
conductor as to where the money should
be kept and how it should be kept safe ?
A. : I don't know but they are given training
how to keep the money safe - page 53 of
the proceedings.
Q. : Do you know who has stolen the money ?
A. : No.
Q. : Are you suspecting the workman to have
stolen the money ?
A. : No. - Page 62 of the proceedings.
It is to be noted that this witness who stated
that the passenger had stolen the money has at
the tail end of cross examination said that he
did not know who has stolen the money.
VI. The workman has in his evidence under the
cross examination on 08.05.2014 stated that
keeping the money in the pocket is not safe as
there has been pick pocketing in the crowded
bus - page 71 of the proceedings. He has stated
further that ticket book cannot be kept inside
the pocket as there is a tray and that during the
training he was not told specifically as to where
money should be kept. To the questions posed
by me he has given the answers as follows :
Q. : Have you given anything in writing as to
how and where the money should be kept
safe ?
A. : No - page 72 of the proceedings.
Q. : During the training were you told in specific
terms as to where and how the money
should be kept safe ?
A. : No specific place - page 73 of the
proceedings.

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRA TIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 12.09.2014
Based on the foregoing evidence of the witness of the
respondent and the workman my determination on the
issues are as follows :
i. There was no evidence in relation to internal
disciplinary inquiry if any conducted by the
board. The workman also has not given evidence
in this regard and he was not cross examined on
this point. I am therefore not in a position to make
a determination on this issue.
ii. The workman was not negligent as the situation
was such that he could not have done anything.
In short he was helpless.
iii. He had not caused the loss of Rs. 8,349 to the
board.
iv. The deduction of Rs. 8,349 from the workman's
salary was not justified as it has not been proved
that he was negligent.
v. In view of my determination in relation to the
issues (ii), (iii) and (iv) above he is entitled to
relief.
6. Relief
I now switch on to the question of relief. The workman
has prayed for the refund of the sum of Rs. 8,349. Taking
into consideration the totality of the evidence led before
me with particular reference to the fact that.
i. The board has not laid down and guide lines as
to how and where the money should be kept safe.
PRINTED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING , SRI LANKA
ii. The board has failed to provide facilities for the
workman to keep the money safe as admitted by
the witness of the board and also stated by the
workman in his evidence.
iii. The workman according to the evidence is
credited with 16 years service and there is no
evidence led by the respondent in relation to an
incident of this nature.
I make award that :
i. The workman is refunded the sum of Rs. 8,349 by
the board.
ii. The board is directed to deposit the sum of Rs.
8,349 with the Assistant Commissioner of Labour
Colombo East 5th Floor, Labour Secretariat.
Colombo 05 within 30 days of the date of
publication of this award in the government
gazette.
iii. The workman is free to withdraw the money once
the deposit is made by the board.
I declare that this Award is just and equiable.
