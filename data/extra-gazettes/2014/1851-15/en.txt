AWARD
The Honourable Minister of Labour Relations and
Manpower Athauda Seneviratne, do by virtue of the powers
vested in him by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
Chapter 131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956
Revised Edition), as amended by Acts,  Nos. 14 of 1957, 4 of
1962 and 39 of 1968 (read with industrial disputes - Special
Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968 hereby appointed me to be
the arbitrator and referred the above said dispute to me for
settlement by arbitration.
Statement of matters in dispute between the aforesaid
parties is as follows :
1. Whether injustice is caused to Mr. A. S. de Zoysa who
retired from services of Kaluthara Bus Company Limited from
06.11.2004 due to reduction of his monthly salary up to rupees
Eight Thousand Six Hundred and Ninety (Rs. 8,690) since the
month of July 2004 whereas he was drawing a salary of rupees
Twelve Thousand (Rs. 12,000) earlier and if any justice is
caused, to what relief he is entitled ?
2. Whether Mr. A. S. de Zoysa is entitled to receive five
special salary increases in terms of the Personal Division
Circular of the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board dated
30.06.2003 treating him as a retired employee as specified
therein and if is so entitled, what should be the total monthly
salary payable to him at the time of his retirement.
and
3. What should be the amount of gratuity payable the A.
S. de Zoysa in terms of the Circular Letter No. 01 of 2002
issued by the Kaluthara Bus Company Limited and if any
arrears of gratuity is due to him what shuold be the amount
payable to him ?
Appearances :
Mr. Udeny Dayarathna - Attorney-at-Law appared for the
Firt Party.
Mrs. Nimasha Ayanthi - Attorney-at-Law (Assistant Legal
Officer) appeared for the Second Party.
At the outset it must be noted that the issues between the
parties are wholly and solely regarding statutory dues.
Therefore its is pertinent to address one’s mind to the
statutory aspects and as such the Assistant Commissioner
of Labour - Panadura Mrs. Lakshmi Mangalika Hewavitharana
was called to produce and mark files of documents relating to
the inquiry of G . G . Norbert - Executive Director as “X”, K. P .
Somathilake, Executive Director - “Y” and A. S. De Zoysa -
Executive Director Marked “Z” and “W” respectively, all of
whom were employed by Kalutara Bus Company Ltd during
the relevant period. Aforesaid persons had complained to
the Assistant Commissioner of Labour (ACL), Panadura
against the Second Party as to the computation of the gratuity
payment due to them.
Norbet’s complaint has been maked X
(1) in that he has
served under the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) from 1975
to 1991 (16 years) and had received Rs. 29,880 as gratuity at
that time for that period and then has served under the
peoplised bus service from 1991 to 2002 (11 years) until his
retirement on as Director 06.08.2002. A3 (28.10.2011) and his
last drawn salary plus allowances had been Rs. 14,400.
Document marked X
(1)/A/9 dated 09.07.2010 depicts that this
services under its predecessor and the Second Party totalled
27 years and gratuity computed on the basis of one month
salary for each completed year of service worked out thus.
Rs. 14,400x27 = Rs. 388,800 and deducted gratuity already
paid and added surcharges of 30% for delay. Further more
this order of ACL has been complied with by both parties,
Incidentally the Court of Appeal Writ Application No. 143/
2003 in Colombo Metropolitan Bus Company Limited V . S. A.
Nimal Saranatissa - the Commissioner of Labour, marked A-
23 which had been applied and acted upon.
Turning to the complaint made by Somathilaka, a hand
written complaint dated 20.07.2004 marked Y
(10). In the ensuing
inquiry he had invited the attention of ACL to Article 116 of
the Articles of Association of Kalutara Bus Company Limited.
Article 116 reads  thus :
“The Secretary to the Treasury may remove an Executive
Director appointed by him and appoint another in his place,
without prejudice to the right of such Executive Director to
claim damages for breach of any contract of employment or
services with the company marked A(6)a
(1) and sinhala
translation A(6)a(1)(S) ”
Where it was revealed that an Executive Officer Grade has
the right to enjoy the same benefits even after removal from
such post, Moreover the one who represented and involved
in the proceedings on behalf of the Second Party Nimal
Jayasekara accepted the above position and reiterated that
SLTB has no objection to computing Somathilaka’s gratuity
on the basis namely Director’s salary and stipulated

allowances according to Y(10)(2) and order of ACL was carried
out complied with without and challenge and Somathilaka
benefited all arrears of slary paid by the Second Party. This
stance had been reinforced by supporting documents marked.
A (25)
(1)(a) and A(26)(1)(a)
A(25)(1)(a) reads as follows :

Thus “the Directors of the Kalutara Bus Company Limited
had decided on 08.11.2004 that a Director's wages or benefits
cannot be reduced, even if removed from the post.”
Be that as it may, after the conclusion of evidence of both
parties on 15.11.2013 time was given to them to file their written
submissions. The Second Party submitted its written
submissions along with documents marked R(1) to R(31) on
30.12.2013 as ordered by Court whereas after obtaining
extended time written submissions were filed by the First
Party along with documents A(1) to A(28) on 02.01.2014.
A review of written submissions of both parties as well as
the evaluation of the evidence recorded reveals the facts to
be relevant to this Court's Award to be as follows :
The First Party (Zoysa) was employed under the Second
Party as a Trianee on 01.01.1961 vide R(a) and R(2) read with
A(2) and rose to the managerial level and later appointed as
an Executive Director on 06.08.2002 vide R(18). While a
Director he was paid a Director's allowances R(15) and was
removed from the post of Director (without a break in service)
on 29.06.2004 by the Secretary to the Treasury by virtue of
powers vested in him under Article 116 of the Articles of the
Association of Kalutara Bus Company Ltd R(19). At the time
of retirement Zoysa is credited with 43 completed years of
service both his predecessors (The Ceylon Transport Board
which was converted into Sri Lanka Central Transport Board
and 9 other Regional Transport Board. Regional Transport
Boards were established as a separate legal entity). The
employees whose services were terminated by the Regional
Transport Board were paid compensation. EPF, ETF and the
Gratuity when they joined the peoplised companies as new
employees. Zoysa was paid Rs. 48,525 as Gratuity.
Be that as it may, after removal Zoysa was reverted to
Grade II salary scale Rs. 8,690 plus the allowances totalling
Rs. 13,600 vide R(15), A(22), A(24) and A(24)(2). And by letter
dated 04.11.2004 Zoysa was compulsorily retired after
reaching 60 years on 06.11.2004. (R(20). His gratuity was
calculated on the basis of last drawn salary vide A(24) (2)
worked out thus, Rs. 13,600x13 years amounting to Rs. 176,800
and his full gratuity was  Rs. 176,800 plus Rs. 48,525
(predecessor's) = Rs. 225,325. The said payment was made in
two parts and also delayed which attracted surcharge for the
delay.
While Second Party maintains that all dues had been paid,
the First Party states that the dues were not fully paid. This
disputes resulted in the First Party seeking relief from the
Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Panadura. The matter in
dispute is as to how payment of gratuity and arrears of salary
if any due to the First Party from the Second Party to be
calculated. As the matter could not be settled amincably it
was referred in terms of 4
(1) of the Industrial Disputes  Act
Chapter 131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956
revised edition) as amended, to this Court.
Next issue is whether the First Party is entitled to five
salary increments in terms of documents R(25) read with
R(26)(1) and R(29). It goes without saying the First Party
worked more than forty three (43) years and therefore entitled
to salary increment of Rs. 200x5 totalling Rs. 1,000 which has
to be included in gratuity calculation is not disputed by the
Second Party. The Second Party's contention was that R(25)
is relevant only to Board Employees and not to the First
Party. On analysis of R(25) refers to a circular No. 02(1) of
2003. Where R(29) first para refers to Circular 2003/2 and
2003/2(1) and the bottom two lines of third para.
reads thus :
—Y%S ,xld .ukd.uk uKav,h kej; ia:dms; l< 2005'10'19

“R(29) clearly states that employees of cluster bus
companies are also entitled to increment from 19.10.2005.”
Morever, R(26)
(1) reiterats the fact that
—2005 ud¾;= ui 01 Èk isg úY%du .ekafjk uKav,Sh

It is abundantly clear to me that the disputes is still alive
and therefore attracts this benefit afforded to those retired
after 01.03.2005 to be applicable to the First Party on the
basis just and equitable principles there can be no room for
technicalities or trivialities.

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 25.02.2014
From the facts and the circumstances, it appears to me
that the First Pary is discriminated. While Nobert and
especially Somathilaka were treated in one way the First Party
was handled in different manner. Evidence adduced by the
witnesses of the Second Party is partial and are not telling
the truth. The question as to why the First Party suffers in
such a manner is unparadonable and therefore he should be
given the relief he prayed for. The above said judgment is
very relevant in calculating the computation of the First Party
because it is the law that stands at this juncture. Thus, in
calculating the computation of gratuity's a person's whole
service should be taken into account if his services were not
broken. In this instant case, the First Party had been in service
without a break for 43 years. The contention of the Second
Party was that when he was absorbed in Peoplisd Bus
Company he was treated as a new recruit. That is incorrect in
terms of the said judgement. So much so, his whole service of
43 years has to be accounted for in calculating his gratuity.
The question is what should be the base on which his
gratuity should be calculated. Is it on Grade II scale or the
Director's scale. The Second Party asserted that he is only
entitled to the last drawn salary. But, the wealth of evidence
supported by documents indicates that what is applied to
Somathilaka and Norbert should also be applied to First Party.
Article 116 reiterates that position. That is to say A(25)(1)(a)
and A(26)(1)(a) referred to above, vouchers for the fact that,
the Directors of Kalutara Bus Company Ltd decided on
08.11.2004 that a Director's wages or benefits cannot be
reduced, even if removed from the post, Undoubtedly his
gratuity should be computed on the basis of Director's salary
plus allowances R(15).
On a parity of reasoning the First Party is entitled to the
following relief :
Computation of gratuity : Director's salary plus the
stipulated allowances thereto.
Salary (Director's) = Rs. 12,000
Allowances Rs. 1,250
Rs. 400
Rs. 2,400 = Rs 6,050
Net Total = Rs. 16,050
In addition add five increments of Rs. 200 = Rs. 1,000
Added total would be = Rs. 17,050
Number of years he had served = 43 years
Total gratuity (Rs. 17,050x43) = Rs. 733,150
Deduct gratuity paid
(Rs. 48,525+Rs. 1,76,800) = Rs. 225,325
Gratuity payable = Rs. 507,825
Surcharge 30% = Rs. 176,800x30%
= Rs. 53,040
Balance payable = Rs. 733,150-Rs.225,325
= Rs. 507,825 + Rs. 53,040
Net Gratutity payable = Rs. 560,865
As regards arrears of salary for, July, August, September
and October 2004, considering the contention of the Second
Party though he may be entitled under A(25)
(1)(a) and A(26)(a).
However, Zoysa cannot be given any such relief requested
for on a reasoning that it is not equitable to grant such an
Award. Reason being after removal another Director had been
enjoying that salary and it will be financial restraint on the
Second Party.
In the circumstances, I make award that the party of the
First Part is entitled to a sum specified above, Rupees Five
Hundred Sixty Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty five only
and Cents Fifty (Rs. 560,865) and this should be deposited
with the Assistant Commissioner of Labour - Panadura within
one month from the date of publication of the Award in the
Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
The Party of the First part is at a liberty to withdraw the
said amount thereafter.
I consider this Award to be just and equitable, in the
circumstances.
