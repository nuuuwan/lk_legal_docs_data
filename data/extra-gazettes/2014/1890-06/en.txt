Whereas in the said order it was stated that the party of
the first part (8 applicants) be paid arrears of salary inclusive
of salary increments, and promotions which are rightfully
due to them on the ground that they have fulfilled the
requirements of the Public Administration Circular Nos.
16/94 of 10.05.1994, 16/94(i) of 30.05.1994 and 16/94(ii) of

Whereas the settlement arrived in the Hon. Magistrate
Court Fort 26 Applicants agreed to accept the calculation of
arrears of salary offered by the Respondent except the
Applicants F. A. Weerasinghe and P. D. Ratnayake.
Whereas the respondent submitted that they are liable to
grant promotions under the Arbitration Award only if the
Applicants have necessary qualifications according to the
Public Administration Circular, and since those 2 applicants
were refused promotions as they were lacking the necessary
qualifications.

according to the Arbitration Award Promotion should be
granted to them as treated that they have fulfilled the
necessary qualification.

Arbitrator was to pay the arrears of salaries and other
increments to the applicants in accordance with the Public
Administration Circular. If the Public Administration Circular
requires certain qualifications to be fulfilled the Applicants
should adhere to that.
Wherefor the said 2 applicants F. A. Weerasinghe and P.
