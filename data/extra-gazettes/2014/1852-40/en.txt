PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 06.03.2014
Act, Chapter 131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon
(1956 Revised Edition) as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957,
4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial Disputes (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968) appointed me as the Arbitrator
and referred the following dispute for settlement by
Arbitration by his order dated 27, August, 2004.
The matter in dispute between the  parties is :
“Whether the termination of  employment of
Mr. H. M. K. K. Bandara of J. L. Morrison, Son and
Jones (Ceylon) Ltd is  justified and if not to what relief
the said workman is entitled’’.
 Mr. E. V . N. Cabraal, Represented the  Applicant Union,
on behalf of the workman H. M. K. K. Bandara, while Miss.
Anjali Wijesinghe, Advisor of the   Employers federation of
Ceylon appeared for the Respondent Company.
After several days and days of inquiry, the workman
proposed that the employer Company settle the dispute,
paying him, half month’s wages per month of denied
employment period, ie. the entire period of interdiction, up to
the date of a settlement. Employer Company considered the
proposal carefully and agreed to settle the dispute as
suggested.
It is a comprehensive full and final settlement, covering
statutory and / or any other entitlement whatsoever. The
total amount works out to Rs. 7,59,360/= (Rs. Seven Hundred
Fifty Nine Thousand Three Hundred and Sixty only). On 24th
January,2014, Employer Company handed over the Bank of
Ceylon cheque dated 23rd January, 2014 to workman Bandara,
in my presence.
This is just and equitable settlement.
