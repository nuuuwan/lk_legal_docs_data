Thereafter, both Parties have engaged in the negotiation
process and tentatively came to an amicable settlement on
26th March, 2015. However, the Court in its wisdom thought
it prudent that the settlement should be worked out at the
Departmental Level - as regards the payments due to the
employees (the Party of the First Part) - on 25th June, 2015.
Accordingly, as per the table it is abundantly clear, that
the payments due to the Party of the First Part were made
affirmatively on 08.06.2015, Mr. S. M. Serasinghe has
obtained his package at Kurunegala District, by Account
Payee Cheque No. 558460 dated 08.06.2015 drawn on
Bank of Ceylon, as net sum of Rupees Forty Five Thousand
One Hundred and Thirty One and Cents Fifty Two only
(Rs. 45,131.52) having deducted the E. P. F. of 8%
amounting to Rs. 3,924.48. In the same manner, Mr. R. M.
Nandapala, had received a net total of a sum of Rupees
Twenty Eight Thousand Four Hundred and Eight and Cents
Sixty Eight (Rs. 28,408.68) having deducted the E. P. F. of
8% amounting to Rs. 2,470.32 by Account Payee Cheque
bearing Number - 300836, dated 08.06.2015 drawn on Bank
of Ceylon Super Grade Kandy. Thus, Party of the First Part
and the Party of the Second Part amicably settled the dispute
between themselves.
Now, I make the Award that Mr. S. M. Serasinghe is
entitled and he had acknowledged a total sum of Rupees
Forty Five Thousand One Hundred and Thirty One and Cents
Fifty Two only (Rs. 45,131.52) as full and final settlement
of  this dispute and whereas Mr. R. M. Nandapala is entitled
and he had acknowledge a total sum of Rupees Twenty Eight
Thousand Four Hundred and Eight and Cents Sixty Eight (Rs.
28,408.68) as full and final settlement of this case.
In the premises, I make that Mr. S. M. Serasinghe and
Mr. R. M. Nandapala a specified sum of Award of Rs.
45,131.52 and Rs. 28,408.68 respectively which they had
already been acknowledged on 08.06.2015 and this Award
comes into effect as at 25th June, 2015 as per case record.
I consider this Award to be just and equitable in the
circumstances.

by Acts, Nos. 14 of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 (read
with Industrial Disputes - Special Provisions) Act, No. 37
of 1968 appointed me as the Arbitrator and referred the
following dispute for arbitration by his order dated 10th
June 2014.
The matter in dispute between the parties is
“Whether Mr. M. S. Silva employed at Airport and Aviation
Services (Sir Lanka) Ltd. has been caused injustice by the
deduction of two days salary, after holding a disciplinary
inquiry against him with regard to an incident that has
occurred at a personal wedding ceremony, and if so, to what
reliefs he is entitled.”
Applicant's Union was represented by Mr. Janaka Adikari,
Attorney at Law, while respondent Organization was
represented by Mr. Lalith Dahanayake and Mrs. Harshani
Sudarika, Attorney at law.
It revealed at the inquiry that applicant M. S. Silva, had
used dirty words, and insulted a manager, having consumed
liqour, at a wedding held on 6th January 2012. The matter
had been reported to the management and in consequence
of a disciplinary inquiry, the applicant was fined 2 days
wages.
Imposition of fine, is regulated by the Wages Boards
Ordinance and the imposition of 2 days fine is inconsistant
with legal provisions Firstly, a fine fund had not been
established with the permission of the Commissioner of
Labour, Secondly, the fine imposed exceeds 5% limit. Thus
violating regulation 2(1) and (11) of Wages Board
regulations.
Instantaneously the applicant tendered an apology to the
management and management accepted, this plea In the
circumstances, parties agreed to resolve the dispute and
maintain status quo , to continue good will.
This is just and fair award.
