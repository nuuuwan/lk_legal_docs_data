NORTHERN    PROVINCE   PROVINCIAL  COUNCIL
The Notification made under Chapter 255 of the Urban Council Ordinance, No. 67 of 1939 read with Section 2 of the
Provincial Council (Consequential Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989
I,  The Chief Minister and the Minister of Finance and Planning, Law and Order, Land, Electricity, Housing and Construction,
Industries and Enterprise Promotion, Tourism, Local Government and Provincial Administration, after a keen study of decisions
which have been submitted by the One Man Commission of inquiry comprising of Mr. Kandiah Ariyanayakam, retired District
Judge, who was appointed under Sub Section (1B)(a) of the Urban Council Ordinance No. 67 of 1939 read with Section 2 of
the Provinicial Council (Consequential Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989 have come to certain independent conclusions.
Accordingly I am satisfied by the conclusion set out in the inquiry report that activities of Valvettithurai Urban
Council had been wantonly disturbed resulting in wilful neglect in the performance of their duties.
Hence, being so satisfied, it is informed that the Velvettithurai Urban Council is dissolved with effect from 01.01.2015
according to Section 184(4A)(a) (Chapter 255) of the Urban Council (Consequential Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989.
