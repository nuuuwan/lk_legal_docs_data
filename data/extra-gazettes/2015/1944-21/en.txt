Y . W. Piyadasa in his evidence reiterated the position
taken by 1st and 3rd Applicants who gave evidence before.
He further stated the Respondent Board used its discretion
to extend service of some employees after the retirement
on contract basis to pay pension benefits and also on various
other reasons used in discretion to pay pension benefits to
some other employees.
Y . N. Ariyatunga, Human Resources Officer of the
Respondent Board in her evidence has stated as follows.
Other than EPF and ETF the Respondent Board contribute
7% of the Salary of the Employees to the Pension Fund.
She said according to R1 there were instances that Pension
benefits were  paid on the discretion of the Board. The
witness further said that Period of Contract Employement
was also taken into consideration when paying Pension
benefits to C. N. D. Perera and 4 others (R1).
The both parties filed Written Submission.
The position taken by respondent is that there is no
injustice done to the applicants and this is not a case where
arbitral powers could be used.
On overall analysis of evidence before me I have come
to the following conclusions.
(i) According to pension fund regulations which has
come into the effect from 1st January 1994, the
Respondent Board has remitted 7% of the total of
salaries of all the employees computed on the
aggregate salary on which contributions are made to
the Provident Fund.
(ii) According to Rule 22.1 An employee to be eligible
for pension he has to be complete as at the date of
his retirement 240 months of service in the Ceylon
Electricity Board. The full period of service has to
be continuous and contributions should have made to
the Provident Fund.
(iii) The Respondent Board has granted pension benefits
to (a) C. N. D. Perera, (b) P. Weerasingham, (c) J.
Jesudasan, (d) T. V . Parameshwaram, and (e) N. J. L.
Fernando who had not completed 240 months of
service at the time of their retirement. According to
evidence given by Y . N. Ariyatunga, Human Resource
Officer they were granted pension benefits after
adding the period that they were employed on
contract basis after their retirement. It is evident that
pension benefits were granted to them under special
circumstances even though they have not completed
mandatory 240 months of service at the time of their
retirement.
At the time of retirement the applicants D. M. J.
Kumarasiri, Y . W. Piyadasa and S. Waniganetti have
completed 233,236 and 214 months of service short of 7,
4 and 26 months respectively for the mandatory 240 months
of service required to qualify for the pension scheme at the
time of retirement.
(iv) During their period of employment the Respondent
Board has remitted to the pension fund 7% of their
total salaries.
(v) I do not see any fairness that the respondent has made
adjustments to pension rules in order to grant
retirement benefits only to selected few who has not
qualified according the said rules.
(vi) I am in a view that it is not just and equitable to deprive
pension benefits to employees who have worked many
years merely because they are short of merely few
months to complete mandatory 240 months of service
at the time retirement.
I am under the opinion that the applicants D. M. J.
Kumarasiri, Y . W. Piyadasa and S. Waniganetti shall be
granted pension benefits. Computation of pension has to be
done on pro rate basis taking retirement benefits entitlement
for 20 years service as the base.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision
of the Supreme Court in state Bank of India Vs. Edirisinghe
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just
and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms
of the contract of employment. He can create new rights
and introduce new obligations between the parties. The
effect of the award is to introduce terms which become
implied terms of the contract. It was pointed out that as
industrial arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in
contrast to a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising
out an existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles
disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come
into force in the future when he cannot get the parties to
agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the
existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesiad it is my finding that the
depriving pension rights of the applicants by the respondent
Electricity Board has caused an injustice to them.

In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality
of evidence led before me I make award that the applicants
D. M. J. Kumarasiri, Y . W. Piyadasa and S. Waniganetti,
(i) Be granted pension rights.
(ii) Computation of pension be done on pro rata  basis
taking pension benefits entitlement for 20 years of
service as the base.
I further made order that this award should be implemented
within 21 days of the publication of this award in the
Government Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka.
               I consider this award just and equitable.
