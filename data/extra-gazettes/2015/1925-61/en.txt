I have reviewed the accompanying Balance Sheet of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL)  as at 30th  June, 2015. This Balance Sheet is the Responsibility of the Management of the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka. My responsibility is to issue a report on this balance sheet based on my review.
I conducted my review in accordance with Sri Lanka Standards on Review Engagements  2400 applicable to Review Engagements. This Standard requires that the  review should be planned and
performed to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Balance Sheet is  free of material mistatements. The review is  limited primarily to inquiries of  personnel of the CBSL and analytical procedures
applied to Financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit.
Based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the accompanying Balance Sheet does not give a true and  fair view.
