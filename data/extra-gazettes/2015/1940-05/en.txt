PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRA TIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 09.11.2015
The matters in dispute between the aforesaid parties are
as follows :-
“Whether injustice has been caused to Mr. W. K. S.
Wijeratne serving in the Piramal Glass Ceylon PLC by being
transferred to the Supplies Division of the company with
effect from 26.10.2009 without employing him in his
earlier post of Cashier and if so to what relief he is entitled”
2. Appearances :
Mr. H. A. Seneviratne Attorney-at-Law appeared for the
Union on behalf of the Workman.
Mr. Chameel N. Perera Attorney-at-Law from Employers'
Federation of Ceylon appeard for Respondent Company.
Mr. A. K. M. Fowzin Head of Human Resources
represeneted the Company.
3. Background facts :
This dispute revolves round the transfer of Mr. W. K. S.
Wijeratne to Supplies Department with effect from
26.10.2009. The Respondent Company is its statement dated
03.02.2012 under regulation 21(1) of the Industrial Dispute
Regulations 1958 has stated that Mr. Wijeratne was
employed as a Cashier in the Finance Division and on
26.10.2009 he was transferred to the Supplies Department
in the same position.
The Union in its statement, dated 02.02.2012 under
Regulation 21(1) of the Industrial Dispute Regulations 1958
has stated that, Mr. Wijeratne was not given the Work of a
Cashier when he was transferred to Supplies Division on
26.10.2009, As, negotiations for a settlement had ended
deadlock  the dispute was taken up for inquiry. The workman
filed his evidence in chief by way of an affidavit which is
avaliable in pages 58-65 of the case record. Documents
A-1 to A-36 have been annexed to the affidavit. These
documents have been marked in the Arbitration Proceedings
but an additional documents A-37 has been marked in the
Arbitration Proceedings. A-37 is the Collective Agreement
entered into between the Respondent Company and the
Intercompany Employees' Union.
According to the proceedings of 27.06.2014 - Page 286,
the Learned Counsel for the Union was unable to identity
the documents marked subjects to proof at that moment.
The documents marked subject to proof were not identified
by him even when the case was closed. The Respondent
Company led the evidence of Niloni Botheju Financial
Controller and marked documents R-01 to R-18. It should
be noted that, R-05 was not marked. Both parties tendered
written submission with marked documents after the case
was closed.
4. Issues to be determined :
(i) Whether injustice has been caused to Mr. W. K. S.
Wijeratne who was serving in the Respondent
Company as a result of his transfer to Supplied
Division of the Company effective from
26.10.2009.
(ii) Whether, he was employed as a Cashier after he
was transferred to Supplies Division effective from
26.10.2009.
(iii) To what relief he is entitled.
5. Analysis of evidence, with particular reference to the
issues to be determined.
The evidence in chief of the Workman by way of affidavit
contains 46 paragraphs, Paragraphs 1-27 in pages 1-5 of
the affidavit deal with matters prior to 26.10.2009 the date
on which, he was transferred to Supplies Division. I have
therefore, decided to examine the evidence in the affidavit
from paragraph 28 onwards.
The evidence of the respondent company in relation to
the transfer of Mr. W. K. S. Wijeratne to the Supplies
Division effective from 26.10.2009 commences at page 307
of the proceedings of 11.09.2015 last question and answer.
6. Evidence of Mr. W. K. S. Wijeratne :
The behavior pattern of Mr. W. K. S. Wijeratne I find has
been to raise objections as a matter of routine for almost
everything. R-09 is the letter of Transfer to Supplies Division
and in that letter, too he has raised objections in his own
hand writing which is marked as R - 09(a)
The Union has sent a letter to the Commissioner of
Labour Industrial Relations marked as A-24, on 05.08.2010
whereat it has been stated that, with the transfer on
26.10.2009 he was performing the work previously done
by a Peon. In his affidavit evidence in chief he has stated
that he was not given a seat in the Supply Division and not
given any work - para 31 of the Affidavit.
In para 38 on the affidavit he has stated that, he has
protested against changing his designation. - A-30 dated
27.06.2011.

3AI fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2015'11'09
PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRA TIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 09.11.2015
To the questions posed by me he has given the following
answers : Page 250 the proceedings of 07.02.2014.
Q : What were the duties you performed when you
were in Supply Division ?
A : I was not given any work and I did not do any work.
Q : Were you paid your salary ?
A  : Yes.
To the next question, under Cross Examination he has
given answer as given below.
Q : Was your Cashier Allowance paid ?
A : Yes, After that stopped
It should be noted that, he had been paid the salary and
also, Cashier Allowance although, has has admitted that, he
did not do any work and that he was not given any work.
He has stated that, the Commissioner of Labour
instructed the Company on two occasions to issue a List of
Duties to him. Accordingly, a List of Duties was given to
him - page 265 of the proceedings of 24.02.2014. This is
marked as R-18 dated 04.11.2010. He was transferred on
26.10.2009 to Supplies Department and a List of Duties
marked as R-18 was issued to him on his own admission.
Having admitted R-18 as the List of Duties given to him he
has made twists and turns subsequently in his evidence in
relation to R-18.
Under Re-Examination on 27.06.2014 in page 284, he
has admitted that, he was given R-18. His evidence in relation
to R-18, which specified his duties, would appear to be
contradictory. I am inclined to think that, he is not speaking
the truth. He has stated in his letter dated 27.06.2011 marked
as A-30 that, his Designation has been given in his Pay Slip
of May, 2011 and June, 2011 as Senior Clerk Special Grade.
In relation to this matter the Witness of the Respondent has
explained as to the circumstances under which, the change
had taken place. He has not stated in Evidence in Chief or
under Cross Examination or Re-Examination as to, what his
terminal salary was and also what loss he has suffered as a
result of his transfer on 26.10.2009 to Supplies Department
which are pivotal issues to determine relief. He has not
complained that, his salary was reduced as a result of the
change of his Designation.
7. Evidence of  Niloni Botheju - Financial Controller of
the Company
Her evidence, was inter-alia as follows :
(i) Mr. W. K. M. Wijeratne was transferred by R-09
to Supplies Department effective from
26.10.2009.
(ii) By R-11 dated 17.11.2009 he had declined to
perform duties at the Supplies Department.
(iii) R-13 dated 16.07.2010 was sent to him by the
Senior Manager Supply Chain. Para 01 of R-13
stipulates the work he has to perform as Cashier.
Page 310 of 11.09.2014. (I find that he has
protested in his own hand writing in R-13 also)
(iv) At the time R-13 was written he had not performed
any duties from 26.10.2009 to 16.07.2010.
(v) The duties he had to perform in the Supplies
Division are in accordance with the
responsibilities given to him as Cashier as per
R-12 (a) - page 318 of the proceedings of
01.10.2014.
(vi) Because, he wanted specific list of duties R-18
was given to him - page 320 of proceedings of
01.10.2014.
Under Cross Examination she has said that, specific
duties were given to him and it has been marked as R-18
page 326 of the proceedings of 04.11.2014.
She has also said that, R-18 was given to him as per
agreeement made at the Labour Department. it was put to
her that, R-18 was not a list of duties and her answer was “I
do not agree. It is list of duties” - page 330 of the
proccedings of 04.11.2014. Her evidence in relation to
change of Designation in R-28(a) and R-28(b) was that, It
was a mistake due to a computer system problem in the Pay
Roll. She also stated that, this mistake was not brought up
by the employee too as he was suspended and there was an
inquiry - Page 332 of the proceedings of 14.11.2014.
Her evidence under Cross Examination on 22.01.2015
at page 344 is as follows :
Q : Why didn't you offer Cashier's duty to the
Workman ?
A : We did offer him Cashier's duties, at the Supplies
Department.

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRA TIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 09.11.2015
Q : I put it to you, that you relieved the applicant from
duty of a Cashier ?
A : I deny because we continued to pay the risk
allowance that is due to a Cashier and also we
continued to retain the Security Deposits that we
had taken from him for the position of Cashier.
To questions posed by me she has answered as follows :
Q : You say you have not changed the designation do
you say that you have assigned work which is not
that of a Cashier to this workman ?
A : No, we have not assigned work which is not that
of a Cashier.
Right along he has performed the work of a Cashier -
page 354 of the proceedings of 29.01.2015.
In page 355 of the proceedings of 29.01.2015 she has
answered as follows to the question posed by me.
Q : With the transfer of the workman to the Supply
Department from 26.10.2009 was he employed
in any work other than that of a the Cashier.
A : He was only doing the Cashier's work at the Supply
Department.
Her evidence has cleared the cloud surrounding my mind,
in relation to the allegations made by Mr. Wijeratne against
the Company, I am inclined to accept her evidence.
8. My determination on the issues is as follows :
(i) No injustice has been caused to Mr. W. K. M.
Wijeratne as a result of his transfer to Supply
Department on 26.10.2009.
(ii) He was employed as a Cashier after he was
transferrred to Supply Department on 26.10.2009.
(iii) He is not entitled to any relief in view of my
determination to issues (i) and (ii) above.
9. Conclusion :
It is considered appropriate to point out that the workman
has not given evidence in relation to the loss, if any, suffered
by him as a result of the transfer to Supplies Department
from 26.10.2009. This evidence is absolutely necessary to
consider relief. In this context  I wish to quote from the
landmark judgment of Justice Amarasinghe in Jayasooriya
Vs State Plantations' Corporation 1995 - 2SLR 379.
“The burden is on the employee to adduce sufficient
evidence to enable the Tribunal to decide the loss”
He has in his judgment cited the observations made in
Adda International Ltd Vs Curio which reads as follows :
The Tribunal must have something to bite and if an
applicant produces nothing to bite he will have only himself
to blame if he gets no compensation.”. Justice Amarasinghe
has also stated that “ the assessment of compensation should
be done based on solid facts submitted by parties.”
Taking into consideration the totality of the evidence led
in arbitration proceedings I decide that the workman merits
no relief. Accordingly I make no award.
