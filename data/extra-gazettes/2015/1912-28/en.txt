by Act, Nos. 14 of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 (read with
Industrial Disputes – Special Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968
hereby appointed me on 10.06.2014 to be the Arbitrator and
referred the above said dispute to me for settlement by
Arbitration.
Statement of matter in dispute:
The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is:
"Whether   the employees of the Cinnamon Grand  Hotel

with the disciplinary practice implemented  with effect from
01.01.2010, and if so, to  what reliefs they are entitled".
Appearances:

Mr. Joseph Leon Arulanandan Arulvasagam-Representative.
Mr. Majuwan Kankanamlagea Hemapala represents for the
Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya - (Parent Union )

Both Parties stated, above have submitted their respective
statement that has lead to the dispute in terms of the
Regulation 21(1) of the Industrial Dispute Regulation, 1958.
Thereafter, Written Submissions were ordered on the
Preliminary Objection made by the Party of the Second Part
regarding jurisdiction of Court.
After, having analayed  red both the Statements and Written
Submissions thereto, it is clearly discerned that there is no
dispute between the parties. This fact was explained in detail
and the end result   was that the party of the First Part
consented to settle the dispute reserving the right, if any, to
make a fresh complaint.
There is, therefore, no dispute in existence now.
I make no Award.
I consider this Award as just and equitable in  the
circumstances.
