Award
1. This is a case where an award was made by me on
22.01.2007 reinstating the workman in employment by Sri
Lankan Air Lines Ltd with effect from 26.03.2007 with four
years back wages amounting to Rs. 1,287,600 (Rupees One

Million Two Hundred and Eighty Seven Thousand Six
hundred only). Sri Lankan  Air Lines Ltd filed a writ application
in Court of Appeal (CA/273/2007 (writ) against my award.
The court of Appeal on 28.03.2013 by way of a Writ of
Certiorari quashed the award in relation to reinstatement of
the workman and issued a writ of Mandamus in terms of
prayer ‘‘e’’ to the original petition that compensation be
computed in lieu of reinstatement with back wages. The
workman thereafter made an application for special leave to
the Supreme Court under Article 128(2) of the constitution -
SC. SPL LA No. 121/2013. The Supreme Court has directed
me to take expeditious steps to have the matter concluded in
terms of the judgment of the court of appeal dated 28.03.2013
after conducting necessary inquiry at which both parties can
be heard.
Accordingly both parties were noticed to be present.
Efforts made by me to settle the disputed by concilliation had
failed. Thereafter Inquiry commenced on 22.05.2014 and it
was concluded on 10.10.2014. Thushari Perera Legal Affairs
Manager of the respondent company gave evidence and
marked documents R1, and R1 A, R1 B and R1 C. The workman
gave evidence and marked documents X and X1. He has also
annexed Supreme Court Judgment in Jayasuria Vs. Sri Lanka
State Plantation Corporation marked as ‘‘Y’’.
2. Appearances
Mr. A. M. Dharmapala Attorney-at-Law appeared for Mr.
Raveendran who was also present. Mr. Kapila Dissanayake
Attorney-at-Law from Employer’s Federation of Ceylon
appeared for Sri Lankan  Air Lines Ltd. Thushari Perera Legal
Affairs Manager represented the company.
3. Evidence of the respondent
Mrs. Thushari Perera Legal Affairs Manager gave evidence
and stated inter  alia that –
i. The total monthly salary of Mr. Raveendran in March
1999 when his services were terminated was
Rs. 25 211 made up as follows –
a.  Basic Salary Rs. 14, 486
b.  Shift allowance Rs. 1000
c.  Tool allowance Rs. 1500
d.  Special premium Rs. 8000
e.  Uniform allowance Rs. 225
ii. The company’s financial position was very bad. In
support of this she produced the Audited Annual
Report for 2012/2013 prepared by Auditors Ernst
and Young chartered Accountants 201, De Seram
Place, Colombo - 10. This was marked as R1. Ten
year Review of the company was marked as R1A
and R1B at pages 65 and 66. The loss for the year
2013 was Rs. 21, 749.75 Million. This was marked as
R1 C - page 66. It was put to her that Mr. Raveendran
has not contributed to the loss, her answer was ‘‘He
was not in the company’’. She stated further that
the huge financial loss would be an important factor
to be considered when awarding compensation.
4. Evidence of Mr. Raveendran
Raveendran’s evidence inter alia was that –
i . His employment as Air craft Technician was
terminated by letter dated 18.06.1999 effective from
26.03.1999.
ii. He could not seek relief from Labour Tribunal as he
was in remand prison for Nine months.
iii. He was 38 years old at the time his services were
terminated.
iv. He tried for a job after his employment was terminated
but he could not find a job for the following reasons –
a. There was a case pending against him.
b. He could not get a clearance certificate.
v. He was not responsible for the financial loss of the
company which occurred after his employment was
terminated.
vi. The losses suffered by him as a result of termination
of employment by the company are –
a. He was not paid the salary revision done by the
company. There has been salary revision three
times and he did not know when and how much ?
b. He was unable to sit for the Engineering License
Exam.
c. He received all increments of salary regularly (08
in all) and the last increment was Rs. 570 and
increments varied from time to time. He cannot
say what is next increment will be.
d. He could not have Air tickets and medical
facilities.
vii. He was praying for salary up to the age of 55 from
26.03.1999. He was 38 years old on 26.03.1999.
viii. Under cross examination he admitted that his terminal
salary on 26.03.1999 was Rs. 25211.

He produced as X1 the certified schedule furnished
by the company in respect of salary increase from
1999 – when he was terminated, up to the year 2013.
5. Determination of monthly salary for computation of
compensation
Raveendran has admitted in his evidence that his monthly
salary in March 1999 when his services were terminated was
Rs. 25211. This is inclusive of fuel allowance special premium
tool allowance etc. According to X1 furnished by the
respondent in response to a motion filed by Raveendran,
there had been fixed salary increase from 1999 to 2013. It is
noted that there has been no salary increase in the year 2009
and in respect of year 2013 the salary increase has not been
indicated but it has been stated – only a performance based
increase. It is therefore not able to ascertain the inrease for
2013. The increase if any for the year 2014 has also not been
indicated by the company in X1. Be it as it may, I have prepared
a schedule giving the total monthly salary with the salary
increase and the total amount due for a year with salary
increase from April 1999 to December 2013. The total amount
Raveendran would have received if he had remained in
employment for the period April 1999 to December 2013
according to my schedule is Rs. 78,77,137.76 (Rupees Seven
million Eight Hundred and Seventy Seven Thousnad One
Hundred and Thirty Seven and cents Seventy Six only).
The schedule prepared by me is annexed hereto marked as
‘‘A’’.
6. Case Law in relation to computation of compensation
The Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950 and its
Amendments do not specify the quantum of compensation
or method of computation of compensation. The Labour
Tribunal is free to award what it considers just and equitable.
The Arbitratior too is free to award what he considers just
and equitable. The Superior Courts have not laid down any
guide lines or recipe as to the quantum of compensation.
There is no judicial unanimity in relation to computation of
compensation. The decisions of Labour Tribunals and
Superior Courts vary from case to case. Some of the judgments
are cited below :
i. Cyril Anthony Vs. Ceylon Fisheries Corporation SC
57/85 SCM 06.03.1986
In this case the Labour Tribunal dismissed the
application after inquiry. The Court of Appeal set a
side the order of the Labour Tribunal and held that
the termination was not justified and awarded one
year salary as compensation. In appeal the Supreme
Court held that compensation awarded was ‘‘grossly
inadequate’’ and ordered Seven Years salary as
compensation.
ii. Parakrama Vs. Bank of Ceylon 1995 1 Sri LR 115.
In this case the applicant was a probationer. There
were inquiries into alleged irregularities and his
services were terminated. Even after the expiry of
four years probationary period he remained a
probationer. He had not passed the necessary
Bankers examinations. He had been warned more
than once. His replies to letters from the Bank were
brusque if not rude and his letters were  unhappily
worded. There was no justification to confirm him.
The Labour Tribunal reinstated him with Two and a
half years back wages or in the alternative with three
years salary as compensation. The Court of Appeal
enhanced the compensation and awarded Seven
years salary. The Supreme Court affirmed the
descision of the Court of Appeal. This is a rare case
of a probationer with four years service being
awarded Seven years salary.
iii. Ceylon Transport Board Vs A H Wijayaratne 77 NLR
481.
Justice Vythiyalingam in his land mark judgment has
stated as follows :
‘‘The amount however should not mechanically be
calculated on the basis of salary he would have
earned till he reached the age of superannuation
and should seldom if not never exceed a maximum of
three years’’.
He has in this judgment set out certain factors to be
taken into consideration by a Tribunal in assessing
compensation which are as follows :
a. Employee’s age
b. Nature of his employment
c. Opportunities of obtaining employment
d. Efforts made by him to secure alternative
employment to mitigate the finacial loss
incurred by him
e. What he earned since his employment was
terminated
f. Employer’s capacity to pay.
It is considered apporpriate to point out that
J. Vythiyalingam subsequently deviated from his
ceiling of three years salary as compensation an
awarded five years salary as compensation in the
case of Henderson and Company Ltd Vs. Wijetunga
– SC 33/73 minutes of 21.03.1975.
iv . In the case of Jayasuriya Vs. Sri Lanka State
Plantations corporation (1995) 2 Sri LR page 379-416
- a land mark judgment by Dr. J Amarasinghe.

<!-- page 4 -->

4A I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2015'01'01
PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 01.01.2015
It is stated that the matters to be considered when
assessing compensation are –
a. Immediate loss ie loss of wages and benefits
from the date of dismissal up to the date of
final order or judgment.
b. Prospective loss.
c. Loss of retirement benefits.
v. Silva Vs. Kuruppu SCM 182/99 14.10.1971 unreported
- Samarawickrama J commented as follows –
‘‘The amount awarded by the president appears to
me to be on the high side and I am unable to take the
view that he has acted on wrong premises or that it
is so excessive that interference by this court is called
for. The assessment of compensation is eminently a
matter within the province of President Labour
Tribunal’’.
vi. In the case of Ladies College Vs. Pamuthevan
Thurainayagam the Supreme Court endorsed the
award of the Labour Tribunal of five years salary as
compensation to a teacher. The Supreme Court
commented as follows –
‘‘The quantum awarded by the Tribunal which
amounts to five years salary does not shock the
conscience of this court and we are unable to find
any legal ground to reduce the compensation so
ordered  in the circumstances of this case SC/24/73/
SCM 06.03.1986.
vii. In Hilman’s Case Justice Sharvananda in a land mark
judgment awarded seven years salary having
considered the judgment of justice Vythiyalingam
in the case of Wijaratna Vs. Ceylon Transport Board
where he had fixed a ceiling of three years salary.
viii. In the case of Glaxo Allenburys (Ceylon Ltd) Vs.
Fernando SC 250/71 decided on 01.12.1972
Rajaratnam J in rejecting the claim for compensation
representing the workman’s loss of salary for the
rest of his life span said as follows – ‘‘In our view
the claim is fantastic. We find it difficult to hold that
a just and equitable order can contain such a harsh
order against an employer to pay the employee for
the rest of his work span after he has forfeited the
employer’s confidence’’.
There are cases where compensation has been
awared even when termination of employment was
held to be justified. Some of them are as follows –
i. Saleem Vs. Hatton National Bank Ltd 1994 3
SLR 409
ii. Brown and company Ltd. Vs. Ratnayake 1986
Bar Association Law Journal at 229.
7. Analysis of Evidence
Respondent’s position is that it has incurred a huge
loss of Rs.21,749.75 million for the year 2012. This is supported
by R1 C in the Audit Report R1. The report contains in pages
65 and 66 a Ten year review of the company’s profit and loss.
There has been continuous loss from the year 2009 to 2013.
Raveendran’s employment was terminated in March 1999. He
cannot be held responsible for this financial loss. No evidence
has been led as to the reasons for the financial loss. I find in
the chairman’s over view for the year 2012/2013 it has been
stated as follows :
i. The year 2012/2013 is an year of growth in that
there was 28.75 increase in revenue when
compared to 2011/2012.
ii. Net loss increased to Rs. 21,749.75 million in 2012/
2013 compared to Rs. 19,774.23 million in the
previous year for the reasons –
* High fuel costs
* Recession in Europe and competition from
other Air Lines
* Significant investments in acquiring
additional capacity and enhancing of
supporting services.
No evidence had been led in relation to any income
earned by Raveendran after his employment was terminated.
In so far as Raveendran is concerned he has led any
evidence in relation to the efforts made by him to secure
employment after his services were terminated to mitigate the
loss. To a question posed to him in evidence in chief on
15.09.2014 he has given answer ‘‘no’’. The question put to
him was - Can you produce any documentary proof to
substantiate your claim that you made an attempt to find
alternative employment ? He had given excuses for not taking
action to secure alternate employment to mitigate the loss.
He has stated that he was not given clearance certificate by
the company. According to evidence he has not asked for
clearance certificate. His evidence in relation to his failure to
find alternative employment cannot be accepted. Raveendran
in his evidence has asked for payment of salary revision,
gratuity, back wages from March 1999 to date, annual
increments and privileges such as free Air Tickets and free
medical facilities. He has stated that he had received annual
increments regularly and that he had received in all eight
increments and the last increment was Rs. 570. He was unable
to state what his next increment would be as it differs from
time to time. In the absence of any evidence on this score I
am unable to compute this. His claim for gratuity being a

PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 01.01.2015
payment due under the Payment of Gratuity Act, no. 12 of
1983 he is free to claim it from the company and thereafter
pursue action with the Labour Department if it is not paid by
the company. In relation to the claim for benefits like free Air
Tickets and free medical facilities no evidence had been led
as to the amount due in this regard. Hence the value of
benefits cannot be computed. In this context it is relevant to
quote from the judgment of J/Dr. Amarasinghe in Jayasuria
Vs. State Plantations Corporation 1995 - 2 SLR 379 -
‘‘The burden is on the employee to adduce sufficient
evidence to enable the Tribunal to decide the loss.’’  He has
also cited the observations made in Adda International Ltd
Vs. Curio which reads as follows -
‘‘The Tribunal must have something to bite and if an
applicant produces nothing to bite on he will have only himself
to blame if he gets no compensation’’.
8. Relief
Raveendran has gone on a long journey in litigation
running to almost fifteen years (1999 to 2014). This is a unque
case where compensation is computed after fifteen years from
the date of termination of employment (26.03.1999). Taking
into consideration the totality of the evidence and the
circumstances surrounding this case with particular reference
to -
i. Failure on the part of the Raveendran to take
action to secure employment to mitigate the loss
suffered by him after his employment was
terminated.
ii. The financial crisis of the company and the
reasons for it as given in the Auditor’s Report
marked as R1.
iii. The lack of evidence in relation to the claims of
increments, air tickets, medical facilities etc.
iv. Age of Raveendran (53 years now) and the lack
of avenues of employment at this age in Air Lines
where he has experience.
v . The case laws given above in relation to
computation of compensation ;
I have decided after careful thought to award
compensation of 75% of the total amount due to him with the
salary increases from March 1999 to 31.12.2013 as per
schedule prepared by me and annexed hereto marked as ‘‘A’’
- ie Rs. 78,77,137.76 x 75/100=5907853.32 (Five million Nine
Hundred and Seven Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Three
cents Thirty Two).
It is ordered that the sum of Rs.5907853.32 (Rupees Five
million Nine Hundred and Seven Thousand Eight Hundred
and Fifty Three and cents Thirty Two) is deposited by Sri
Lankan Air Lines Ltd, Administration and Training Building,
Bandaranayake Intanational Airport, Katunayake with the
Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Labour Office, Negombo
within 45 days (forty five) of the date of the publication of
this award in the Government Gazette of Sri Lanka for payment
to T. Raveendran.
T. Raveendran is free to withrdaw the moneys once
the deposit is made.
I declare that this Award is just and equitable.
