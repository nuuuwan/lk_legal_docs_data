Award
The Honourable Minister of Labour and Labour Relations
Gamini Lokuge, do by virtue of the powers vested in him by
Section 4 (1) of the Industrial Disputes  Act, Chapter 131
of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised
Edition), as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957,4 of 1962
and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial Disputes - Special
Provisions) Act No. 37 of 1968 hereby appointed me on
04.12.2014 to be the Arbitrator and referred the above said
dispute to me for settlement by Arbitration.
Statement of matter is dispute :
The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is :
“Whether the 1130 employees mentioned in the schedule
annexed hereto, working at SLT Manpower Solutions (Pvt.)
Ltd. (Present name - SLT Human Capital Solutions (Pvt.)
Ltd) have been caused injustice in the payment of bonus
from 2012 onwards, by non compliance with the procedures
followed in the payment of bonus to the employees of Sri
Lanka Telecom (PLC), and if so, to what relief they are
entitled.”
Appearances  :
Party of the First Part :
Party of the First Part is absent
Representative Mr. S. P. Wijemanna is present
Party of the Second Part :
Mr. Adhil Khasim Attorney-at-Law Industrial Relations
Advisor - The Employers’ Federation of Ceylon is absent.
Mr. Diwan Ruwanpura - Manager Operations and Legal
appears for the Sri Lanka Telecom Human Capital Solutions
(Pvt.) Ltd appears for and represented on behalf of the Party
of the Second Part.
Both Parties were noticed under registered cover to be
present on 20.01.2015. The Party of the Second part filed
the First Statement whereas the Party of the First Part failed
and neglected in their duty. Court ordered Ex- parte inquiry
returnable, of the Party of the First Part having duly noticed,
on 02.03.2015. Thereafter, Party of the First Part submitted
their First Statement while Second Statement was filed of
record by the Second Part.
When the case was taken up on 29.04.2015 a new move
was made on behalf of the Party of the First part - though
absent for unknown reaso
n - by their Representative whose
letter of authority is filed of record, urges the Court to
withdraw the complaint made against the Party of the Second
Part subject  however, to reserve the right to file a fresh
complaint against the Second Part in the future.
In the premises, having scrutinized the statements and
today’s application for withdrawal it is abundantly clear to
me that the Party of the First Part cannot have and maintain
their case at all. Come what may, I do not stand in the way of
a withdrawal made by the Representative on behalf of the
Party of the First Part.
I allow the withdrawal and make no Award
I consider this Award as just and equitable in the
circumstances
