SCHEDULE  III
(regulation 9)
1. Calculation of Steviol equivalent :
[SE] = CF x [SG]
Where
CF = Conversion Factor as listed in column II of Schedule II for the corresponding steviol glycoside
in column I of Schedule II
[SG] = concentration of individual steviol gloycoside
[SE] = concentration as steviol equivalents
2. Examples for calculation of steviol equivalent :
2.1 Example of calculation of steviol equivalents for a single glycoside :
A preparation of 100 mg/kg of Rebaudioside B contains 100 x 0.40 = 40 mg/kg steviol equivalents.
2.2 Example of calculation of steviol equivalents for a mixture of glycoside :
For a preparation containing 100 mg/kg of a mixture of 90% Stevioside, 5% Rebaudioside B and %5
Rebaudioside A, the steviol equivalent is
[ (0.9 x 0.40) + (0.05 x 0.40) + (0.05 x 0.33) ]  x  100  =  39.65 mg/kg
2.3 Example of calculation for maximum permitted level of a steviol glycoside preparation :
To calculate teh maximum permitted level of a steviol glycoside preparation which contains 90% Stevioside,
5% Rebaudioside B and 5% Rebaudioside A, in a food where the permission is 160 mg/kg (steviol equivalents).
To determine the equivalence for this preparation :
[ 0.90 x (160 / 0.40) ]  +  [ 0.05 x (160 / 0.40)]  +  [ 0.05 x (160 / 0.33) ]  =  404  mg/kg.
