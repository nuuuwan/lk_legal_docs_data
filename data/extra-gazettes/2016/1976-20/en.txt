vested in him by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
Chapter 131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956
Revised Edition), as amended by Acts, No. 14 of 1957, 62
of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial
Disputes - Special Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968 hereby
appointed me as the Arbitrator by his order dated 19th
November 2009 and referred the dispute between the
aforesaid parties for settlement by arbitration.
The statement of the matter in dispute between the
aforesaid parties is as follows :
“Whether any injustice was caused to Mr. P. H. Payagala
in consequent of demoting him to the post of Portfolio
Manager and transferring to the Wattala Branch of
Janashakthi Insutrance PLC with effect from 29.10.2008
by the company while he was serving in the post of its
Assistant District Sales Manager since 15th December, 2001
and if any injustice was caused, to what relief he is entitled
from the said Company.”
Appearances :
Party of the First Part
Party of the First Part is absent and unrepresented.
Party of he Second Part :
Mr. Chamil Wickramasinghe - Attorney-at-Law appears
on behalf of the Party of the Second Part.
Mrs. T. M. N. S. Basnayaka - Senior Human Resources
Executive represents on behalf of the Janashakthi Insurance
PLC.
Both Parties have been noticed and their respective
statements were filed of record. Thereafter, the Party of
the First Part commenced his Evidence in Chief and while,
the Cross Examination was proceeding his services had been
terminated and he had filed an application in the Labour
Tribunal No. 02, Colombo - Case No. 2/167/2011.
In the circumstances the case was laid by.
In order to ascertain the present position of the said
Labour Tribunal Case, Colombo Parties were noticed to be
present on 18th April, 2016. On the day in question the Party
of the First Part was absent and unrepresented. However,
the Party of the Second Part informed the Court, that the
matter had been settled between them in the Labour Tribunal
on or about, 19th March 2012.
There is therefore, no dispute subsisting. This has been
confirmed by the proceedings filed of record, of the said
Labour Tribunal dated 29.02.2012 and the order was signed
by Honourable R. A. P. C. Ranatunga President and Additional
Magistrate.
In the premises, this matter had been frustrated and it has
no force or avail in law.
And as such I make no Award.
Accordingly, I consider this Award as just and equitable
in the circumstances.
                                                                        Arbitrator.
