work until 1985, Thereafter, he was transferred to
Tispane Estate where he worked for 5 years, until,
1st October 1990, on which date he assumed duties
at Barcaple Estate.
Workers were aggressively protesting, expressing
their dissatisfaction, as there were weeds and
creepers overgrown, and owing to the fear of
existence of poisonous reptiles and failure of
managment to understand the situation and remedy
the issue, to convince the management, the applicant
had on 23.08.1997 taken photographs. Workers were
agitated and stopped work for 1/2 a day.
On 25th August 1997, he was interdicted for
photographing witout permission. The superintendent
held the disciplinary inquiry. He protested the
superintendent holding the inquiry, as he himself
made the accusations, However the inquiry was held,
and after the inquiry, he was suspended for 2 months.
When he reported for work after 2 months
suspension, management transferred him to lower
division, where the quarters allocated was unsuitable
for occupation.
Instead of reporting, he filed action in labour tribunal
for “Constructive Termination” and labour tribunal
president, ordered that applicant be :-
i. Reinstated on 23rd February, 1998 and
ii. Pay an ex-gratia sum of Rs. 8,000/-
Managment duly paid the sum of Rs. 8,000/- but the
quarters offered was unsuitable for occupation, which
he promptly brought to the notice of managment.

communication between the applicant and the
company, and involving the Labour Office,
Nawalapitya, the Company, and the Deputy

issue with Labour Office, Nawalapitya on 25th July
1999 at the inquiry, managment consented to resolve
but failed to comply. then the matter was taken up by

them. The parties to the collective agreement
were

Estate Staffs Union on the one part, and
2) the Employers Federation of Ceylon on

Section 5 read with Section 8 of the Industrial
Disputes Act states :
Section 5(1). In this Act “Collective
Agreement” means an agreement-
a) Which is between :-
I. Any employer or employers, and
II. Any workman or any Trade Union
or Trade Unions consisting of
workman, and
b) Which relates to the terms and conditions

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 12.04.2016
observe in respect of all other workmen in that
industry terms and conditions of employment
which are not less favourable than the terms
and conditions set out in that agreement.
By operation of law the Kahawatte Plantations Ltd.
is required to comply with the provisions of the
Collective Agreement to other employees performing
identical functions. In consequence, the terms and
conditions of the employee automatically gets
altered, thus such terms become implied terms of
the employment contract.
B. Workers in the Barcaple estate protested to express
their dissatisfaction, on account of management's
failure to clear the weeds and overgrown creepers,
for fear of existence of poisonous reptiles.
Managment had not heeded and workers resorted to
strike action. Applicant had taken photographs to
convince the managment. Management was
dissatisfied as he had not taken prior permission.
Thereafter a series disciplinary processes were
initiated but were not in conformity with the basic
requirements of law and natural justice, and were in
breach of provisions of the Collective Agreement,
vide Clause 16 and 17.
Collective Agreement, in clauses 16 and 17 stipulate
the following conditions :
Clause 16: Suspension as a measure of
punishment
“Punishment for offences in the
case of an employee may include
suspension, provided however the
such suspension shall not exceed 14
days without pay. Punishment in
excess of 3 days suspension without
pay shall only be after  a domestic
inquiry.
Clause 17 : Suspension pending disciplinary and
follow up inquires :
1) An employee may be suspended from work without
pay for a period of not exceeding one month pending
a disciplinary inquiry when there is a prima face
evidence, in the opinion of the employer, of a charge
or charges of misconduct against him.
2) Suspension of an employee on the ground referred
to in sub-clause (1) above for any period in excess
of one month shall be on half pay.
3) The provisions contained in sub-clause (1) and (2)
above shall not apply to the suspension of an
employee pending inquiries by the police, by other
public authorities or audit verifications.
The disciplinary process adopted by the managment,
is as follows :-
a) 02.07.1997 alleged that petitioner erroneously
noted the clocking time.
Petitioner had been suspended for 7 days
Mangement breached the clause 16 of the
Collective Agreement, which state that
punishment in excess of 3 days suspension
without pay shall only be after a domestic
inquiry. No domestic inquiry was held.
b) 20.08.1997 Charged for drop in plucking
average imposed a warning.
c) 20.08.1997 Charged for smelling of liquor
Applicant had been suspended pending inquiry
Superintendent prepared a document, type it and
get the signatures of his subordinates in office.
No proper domestic inquiry had been held.
d) 23.08.1997 and 25.08.1997 charged for
photographing without permission
Petitioner had been suspended for 2 months
without pay.
Managment breached the provisions in clause
16 of the Collective Agreement, which state
that suspension shall be limited to 14 days,
where as in this instance, it had exceeded the
limit. Besides, Superintendent himself
conducted the disciplinary inquiry and imposed
the punishment, whereby breached the very
fundamental concept of natural justice.
Also, It is noteworthy to highlight the essential
of a proper domestic inquiry.
- the employee proceeded against has been
informed clearly of the changes leveled
against him.
- the witnesses are examined - ordinarily
in the presence of the employee - in
respect of the charges ;

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 12.04.2016
- the employee in given a fair opportunity
to cross examine witnesses.
- he is given a fair opportunity to examine
witnesses including himself in his
defence if he so wished on any relevant
matter and.
- the enquiry officer records his findings
with reasons for the same in his report.
e) 27.10.1997 Immediately after 2 months
suspension, management effected a transfer to
another division.
Applicant instead of reporting for work filed
action in Labour Tribunal, alleging constructive
termination of employment.
f) Feb. 1998 after brief inquiry learned Labour
Tribunal President, orders -
* Reinstatement effective 23.02.1998 and
* payment of Rs. 8,000/- by way of ex-
gratia
Managment pays up Rs. 8,000/- ordered by the
Labour Tribunal, but fails to turn up to take
charge of the quarters occupying.
g) 02.04.1998 Applicant interdicted
Applicant had been accused of failure to
handover the quarters he occupied and not
occupying the quartrs offered at another
division. Applicant found that the new quarters
offered had no water and toilet facilities (The
basic facilities)
C. It is seen that the transfer effected itself from another
mode of punishment. There are certain guarantees,
provided in law relating to occupation of estate
quarters :-
The Estates Quarters (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2
of 1971 states in Sec. 2, as follows-
“Period during which the right to occupy quarters
subsists after the termination of employee's service
Section 2. Where the services of any person who is
an employee on the estate and who is provided
with quarters on the estate are terminated by
the employer, whether with or without notice,
then notwithstanding the  terminatioin of such
services.
such person shall :-
a) have the right to occupy such quarters together
with his dependents until he is ejected there
from on a decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction ;  and
b) During the period he exercises the rights
conferred on him by paragraph (a), be entailed
to have all the facilities which are necessary
for the exercise of that right and which he had
prior to the termination of his services.”
D. On the direction of the Deputy Commissioner of
Labour (Industrial Relations) the Labour Officer,
Nawalapitiya inspected the condition of quarters
offered to the applicant ; He reported that the quarters
were of sub-standard. Managment's argument that
labour officer failed to inform the managment, prior
to his visit is misleading, in that, if employers were
to be informed of their visits no detections could be
done.
After several discussions at the Labour Department,
the management failed to provide a suitable quarters
and pay the salary.
During the period of interdiction, applicant had given
the quarters to a trusted person to look after, who
was working in the estate, and once in a way he visited
the house. In consequence managment stopped the
work of that workman and his wife as well. Since the
applicant was under interdiction he had no earning to
subsist.
E. Management allegation that Labour Officer who
inspected the suitability of quarters was done without
intimation to managment is unacceptable. The law
provides that an authorized officer is empowered to
visit any premises, at any reasonable hours by day or
night. Regulation 39(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act
is reproduced hereunder :-
Regulation 39(1) made under the Industrial Disputes
Act states
[1] The Commissioner or any authorized officer
or a labour officer or any other officer
appointed under the Act, may for the purpose
of investigating any matter connected with or
having a bearing on any industrial dispute which

exists or apprehended, at reasonable hours by
day or might :-
a) Enter any premises or place in which
employer's or workmen who are parties
to such dispute work :
b) Inspect the said premises or place and any
amchinery, appliances or articles therein
; and
c) Examine any person whom he finds in
such premises or place.
[2] It shall be the duty of the person in chargs of
any premises or place of the description
specified in the preceding paragraph and every
agent or servant of such person to furnish such
facilities as may be required by any officer for
the purposes of any entry, inspection or
examination which that officer is empowered
to carry out under the said paragraph.
F. Besides, all these issues emanated with he workers
striking for 1/2 a day, which erupted due to the
managements failure to get the weeding done during
proper time. The system in the plantations is that a
certain time schedule need to be adopted in relation
to uprooting, replanting application of fertilizer,
weeding and plucking, If plucking is delayed, the
overgrown leaves needs to be removed, and process
is costlier.
G . Maintenance of discipline is the prerogative of the
management. If and when issues of misconduct or
indiscipline arise ; such issued to be tackled
cautiously within the legal frame without harming the
industrial peace established by the stakeholders.
In conclusion, I find that the decision of the
management in relation to the allegations against the
applicant will not prevail.
- as there is want of bona fides.
- it is a clear case of victimization or extreme
form of unfair labour practice in violaton of
the principales of natural justice.
- there is basic error on facts ; and
- there has been a perverse findings on the
materials.
Having emained the evidence comprehensively, I
award that the applicant workman be paid according
to the following basis -
a) In terms of the Collective Agreement No. 1 of
1998, and the subsequent collective agreements
the applicant workman shall be placed on the
proper salary in the scale, and compute monthly
salaries due until he reached the retirement age
of 58 yrs, as per the said agreement, (Short
payment due from 02.04.1998 until he reached
58 years)
b) The applicant workman be paid the cost of living
allowance computed in terms of the Collective
Agreement No. 1 of 1998, and the subsequent
Collective Agreement arising there from, until
the workman's retirement on reaching 58 yrs.
c) The statutory matters for the recovery of
Employees Provident Fund dues, Employees
Trust Fund dues and Gratuity dues to be looked
into by the Dept. of Labour.
d) Any other dues, emanating from the
implementation of the collective agreement
provisions, such as benefits under the medical
scheme etc. to be canvassed at the Department
of Labour.
The amounts computed by way of salaries and cost
of living allowances due, shall be deposited with the
Labour Officer, Labour Office, Nawalapitiya within
45 days of publication of this award in the
Government Gazette.
This is just and an equitable award.
