PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 17.10.2016
AWARD
1. The Honourable Minister of Labour Relations and
Manpower,  by  virtue of the powers vested in him by Section
4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, Chapter 131 of the
Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised Edition),
as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957, 62 of 1957, 4 of 1962
and 39 of 1968 read with the Industrial Disputes (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968 appointed at me as the
Arbitrator by his order dated 10.02.2010 and referred the
dispute between the aforesaid parties to me for settlement
by Arbitration.
2. The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is-
“Whether the dismissal of Mr. G. L. L. Peiris who was in
the service of the Kusumpokuna Paddy Purchasing Centre,
Polonnaruwa which was managed under the Co-operative
Wholesale Establishment over a shortage in the paddy stock
said to have taken place there during the periods from
01.01.2002 to 31.10.2002 and from 31.10.2002 to
31.12.2002 respectively is justified and if not justified, to
what relief is Mr. G. L. L. Peiris is entitled.”
3. Mr. Wilbert Perera, appeared for the applicant at the
outset, while Mr. Chandra Gunatilleke and Mr. Nilisha
Gunatilleke Attorneys at law appeared for the Respondent.
Midway Mr. Wilbert Perera passed away and Mr. K. G .
Navaratne succeeded, who insisted that the case be heard
de-novo stating that it's the Respondent who should start
the case. However late Mr. Wilbert Perera, on his own
decided to start the case and it was after more than 2 years
later that the request emerged.
Based on Court of Appeal Judgment 1418/78 heard by
Justice Ratwaththe and Justice Rodrigo, the Arbitrator can
start the inquiry by calling upon any party in the first instance
to place his case before him and thereafter hear the other
party if necessary.
With my ruling, the inquiry continued, without any
change.
4. The applicant Mr. G . L. L. Peiris stated that he was
appointed as Junior Clerk with effect from 01st April 1979
and on application appointed to work in paddy stroes. He
was assigned work at the following paddy purchasing sites
at different times.
- Aralaganwila
- Medirigiriya - Vijayapura
- Dimbulagala
- Medirigiriya
- Kusumpokuna
While working at Kusumpokuna 937, the paddy
purchasing stores, had been subject to a verification to
determine surpluses and shortages. Consequent to the
verification, a shortage of paddy detected and five charges
were framed on 16.12.2004. The total value of the shortage
worked out to Rs. 904,092.92.
The detection was made on May 2003, but the charge
sheet was given after about 17 months, having interdicted
on 06th May, 2003, and kept on no pay.
Domestic Inquiry, on the 5 charges were convened for
13.05.2005 and 27.06.2005, but the applicant refrained from
participating. Thereafter management held the domestic
inquiry ex-parte and terminated his services on 09th
November 2005, with effective date of termination as 07th
May, 2003.
Since there was a delay in issuance of a charge sheet and
holding of the Domestic Inquiry, the applicant filed a plaint
in the Labour Tribunal seeking relief, on “Constructive
termination”, but the application got dismissed.
During the course of the proceedings, document R5 was
shown to the applicant, who deny that it is his signature and
respondents lawyer requested that the document in question
be sent to the Examiner of Questioned Documents, to
ascertain the authenticiy, as to whether it carries the signature
of applicant or not. Examiner of Questioned documents
requested that at least 5 letters, wherein applicants signature
appears during the years 2000 and 2003 be sent to them for
comparison.
5. On behalf of the respondent organization the witness,
Mr. Mahendra Upendra, Courts  Officer stated that,
He joined on 1st July, 2000 and worked as a court of
officer from 2004.
The paddy purchasing centers have been established in
Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Ampara Mr. G. L.
L. Peiris applied for the post of paddy purchasing officer,
voluntarily. He served at several paddy purchasing centers
and was interdicted with effect from 06th May, 2003
consequent to a stock verification which surfaced a paddy
shortage amounting to Rs. 688,629.73, subsequently, this
amount revised thus reducing to Rs. 532,992.92.
It was revealing that management failed to issue a show
cause letter, as a result of restructuring of CWE, thus
introducing a V oluntary Retirement Scheme, whereby 6000
employees were reduced to 4000, in 2004.
A charge sheet had been issued after almost 17 months
and no salaries were paid after interdiction. The applicant,
after sometimes sought relief from the Labour Tribunal on
the ground of constructive termination.
Witness also said that he had experience in handilng
disciplinary as well as court cases, concerning various types
of offences committed by employees in the organization.
He said that verification of paddy stocks at paddy purchasing

centres were done by competent and experienced officers,
and revision of shortages were reviewed, taking into
consideration the wheather conditions and wetness in the
paddy purchased. It is analyzed on certain accepted scientific
basis.
6. The next witness for the respondent was Mr. Geenani
Chandana Janaka Gunaratne Clerk who stated that he worked
at Cooperative Wholesale Establishment from 1999 as a
clerk. From 2002 to 2010 was attached to the administration
and legal divisions performing courts work. Now he works
at the sales centre, Piliyandala.
He stated that the organization adopts the Disciplinary
Code approved by the Board of Directors and it was in
operation for several years. He accepted the fact that the
charge sheet had been issued after 17 months, from the date
of commission of offence.
7. My observations and findings are as follows :-
(A) Under Article 170 of the Constitution of Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, A Public Corporation
has been defined to mean.
“Any corporation, board or other body which was or
is established by or under any written law, other than
the Companies Ordinance, with capital wholly or
partly provided by the government by way of grant,
loan or otherwise.”
The State Establishing a public corporation makes it
a legal entity with perpetual succession and a
common seal and with capacity to sue and be sued in
its corporate name.
The Co-operative Wholesale Establishment came
into existence per Act, No. 47 of 1949 (amended
from time to time) on similar lines.
(B) Respondent Organization Co-operative Wholesale
Establishment (CWE)'s Board of Directors approved
on 08th January, 1980, a Disciplinary Code, and
implemented the procedure laid down therein in all
disciplinary matters.
Paragraph 8, amongst other things state as follows
in relation to interdication and inquiry issues -

(C) The core issue in this dispute is the disciplinary
procedure adopted by the CWE in relation to the
shortage of paddy detected by the stock verification
team.
Briefly stated, the applicant had worked as a paddy
purchasing officer at Aralaganwila, Medirigiriya -
Vijayapura, Dimbulagala and Kusumpokuna at
different times. As far back as May 2003, the stock
vertification team headed by Mr. W. A. S. Weerasuriya
and Mrs. Inoka Dilani, detected a paddy shortage
amounting to Rs. 904,090.92. On detection of the
shortage, the applicant had been interdicted, without
pay. The charge sheet lists 5 charges, was issued after
17 months.
(D) Applicant in the meantime filed action in the Labour
Tribunal, bearing Case No. 2/630/2004 on the
ground, “constructive termination”, which was
dissmissed, LT President stated in his order thus-

(E) Respondent  appointed an inquiry officer and he
summoned the applicant, for inquiry on 13.05.2005
and 27.06.2005 but the applicant refrained from
particpating. Thereupon, inquiry officer, held the
inquiry ex-parte and terminated applicants services
on 09.11.2005, with effective date of termination
being 07.05.2003. It is observed that managment
held the domestic inquiry only after 24 months from
the date of interdiction.
(F) Applicants letter of appointment, issued by CWE, in
Para 12, require complinance with rules and
regulations issued from time to time, and is duty
bound to present at inquiry and exonerate himself of
the charges if innocent. While interdiction, the
contract of employment subsists, and the applicant
had misconducted in this instance.
Applicant stated that all records pertaining to the
paddy purchase and disposals were handed over to
Mr. H. M. W. Bandara, Divisional Manager
(Security), Polonnaruwa on 25.03.2003, and
produced a receipt in proof thereof. This person had
not given evidence, as such that document cannot be
relied upon.
Besides, in paddy purchasing stores. A store keeper
responsible is required to retain a copy of the issue
receipt, to prove the exact amount sent out whenever
a shortfall is detected, such documents are in proof

of deliveries of goods sent out. No such document
was produced.
(G) Security personnel, after verification, obtained a
statement signed by the workman applicant, which
the applicant deny signing any. This document, marked
R5 was referred to Examiner of Questioned
Documents, who in the first instance requested more
documents which carry signature of the applicant.
Thereafter another set was sent. In the second
occasion EQD testified that signature on R5
resembles the signature of applicant. EQD’s ref.
H.376/14 of 12.12.2014 letter was received by/
Registrar Industrial Court on 17.12.2014 which
reached the Industrial Court long after receipt of
written submissions as such EQD’s reply has no
evidential value.
However, respondent should have fielded the, 2
persons who carried out stock verification on 2nd
May, 2003, and given evidence to substantiate the
charges, but CWE failed to do so.
(F) In the final analysis it is clear that management had
failed to comply with its own Disciplinary Code, in
not placing the workman on half pay during period
of interdication ; failed to issue a charge sheet until
PRINTED A T THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING , SRI LANKA
17 months, and domestic inquiry after 24 months
whereas CWE employs and army of executives to
handle such cases. Management had been negligent
of its duties, and delay had defeated equity. This
seems to be an extreme instance of harassment.
8. Therefore, I award an ex-gratia payment of
Rs. 231,498.24 payable to the applicant, in relation to 24
years he served at CWE. His last drawn salary had been
Rs. 9,645.76, My calculation is guided on the formula
stipulated, under the Termination of Employment of
Workman (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971, as
amended. The sum of Rupees Two Hundred and Thirty One,
Four Hundred Ninety Eight and  Cents Twenty Four shall be
deposited with Asst. Commissioner of Labour, Colombo
South District Labour Office, Sixth Floor, Labour
Secretariat, Colombo 05, within 45 days, or publication of
this award in the Government Gazette .
This is just and a equitable award.
