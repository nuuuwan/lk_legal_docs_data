(b) Where an employee commutes his monthly pension in the manner aforesaid, the monthly pension payable to him during
the first ten  years of retirement will be 75% of the monthly pension he would have been entitled to at the time of
retirement if he had not so commuted his pension. After the expiry of the said ten  years the amount of the monthly

opted by him, but not to both. Provided further that in the case of an employee whose premature retirement
occurred in consequence of an accident which entitled him to compensation, the pre - acceptance of pension
as provided herein will not restrict the right of such employee in subsequently claiming any balance com-
pensation under any written law. The entitlement to a pension under this provision shall be forfeited in the
event of the employee concerned accepting employment elsewhere and the bank shall have no obligiation to
make any further payment to him before taking action to stop the payment of pension, the bank will give the
pensioner two calendar months' notice to explain why the pension should not be withdrawn as a result of him
obtaining employment elsewhere. The Bank's decision thereafter will be final.
