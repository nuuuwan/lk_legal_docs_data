PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 08.02.2016
05. It was the position of the applicant that on his
retirement only Personnel Division Circular No. 4
of 1974 and 10 of 1975 were applicable. (R1 and
R2).
06. Therefore the applicant's position was that he is
entitled to compensation in terms Section ( w) (ii)
of the Circular of No. 4 of 1974 (R1).
Provisions of the Circulars
Before I proceed to examine the Respondent's
position it is pertinent to examine the provisions of
the two circulars (R1 and R2).
1. Circular No. 04 of 1974 (R1) provide for
compensation payable to persons who are retired on
medical grounds. It can be classified into two broad
categories.
(i) Persons who are retired prior to reaching age
of 55 years.
(ii) Per sons who are retired reaching age above 55
years.
Since the above Circular (R1) did not provide
for persons who had reached the age over 59
years of age the Circular No. 10 of 1975 (R2)
provided the scheme for compensation for
such persons.
Thus the above Circulars R1 and R2 had to be read together.
Respondent's Position
01. The Respondent has admitted above data in relation
to the applicant.
02. Respondent also admit that the above Circulars R1
and R2 are applicable to the applicant (Paragraph 4)
03. (i) In the statement of the Respondent (Paragraph
5) it was stated in terms of Section 2 of
Circular No. 10 of 1975 (R2) a person retired
is not entitled to compensation in lieu of
notice and thus application of the Respondent
should be dismissed.
(ii) But, what have to be noted is the said Circular
refers only to persons retiring whose ages are
above 59 years and thus not relevant as the
applicant was retired at the age of 54 years 09
months.
04. (i) However when oral evidence was led it was
stated although in view of the changes of
government policy retirement age being
reduced to 55 years circular R1 and R2 was
applied in relation retirement age of 55.
(ii) Further in oral evidence as well as in written
submissions of the Respondent it was
submitted in view of the retirement age being
reduced to 55 years by the Government
Circular 95 (R4) the Respondent has issued
Personnel Division Circular No. 5 of 1976
(R3)
05. (i) The Respondent stated although retirement age
was reduced to 55 years by R4 and R3 no
amendment to R1 and R2 was effected by a
Circular.
(ii) But, however Respondent stated in oral
evidence for this purpose had applied letter
dated 17.11.1998 (R5), issued to  O. I. C. Uva
Bus Company Ltd. in relation to one particular
employee.
06. (i) As pointed by the applicant it is a letter (R5)
written to O. I. C. Uva Bus Company Ltd by
the Personnel Manager on 17.11.1998
verifying position of one K. M. Senanayake
(peon) and thus on the face of it, was not a
Circular applicable to all employees.
(ii) In fact it is a reply to a letter and it does not
indicate it is a management decision of the
Respondent.
(iii) Further it says it is desirable to follow ( l%shd
lsÍu uekú) and thus is not directive.
07. Thus the variation stipulated by the letter (R5) to
give adjustment to variation in maximum age of
retirement had been purely done by an official on
his whims with no proper management decision and
or direction as admitted by the evidence of the
Respondent and thus not binding on the applicant.
Decision
Based on above facts firstly I will answer the issues raised.

A- Y e s
3. Q - If the above issue is answered in favour of the
Applicant, what is the relief the Applicant is
entitled to ?
A - I am awarding that the applicant is entitled to
receive as compensation at a salary of 5 months
and further salary of 12 months as he has
servied more than 19 years namely Rs.
215,958 (12,705x5+12,705x12).
Respondent's Issues
4. Q - Is the Personnel Division Circular No. 1975/
10 is the one applicable to the Applicant ?
A - On admission both Circulars bearing No. 4 of
1974 (R1) and No. 5 of 1975 (R2) are
applicable.
5. Q - If it is applicable, is the Applicant entitled to
compensation as claimed by the Applicant ?
A - In view of the answer to issue No. (4) above in
favour of the applicant the applicant in entitled
to compensation claimed.
Conclusion
01. Thus it is clear on admission of the Respondent what
is applicable and effective to the applicant is
Personnel Division Circulars No. 4 of 1974 read
with 5 of 1975 (R1 and R2)
02. Although the maximum age of retirement has been
varied by R3 and R4 the no circular had been issued
giving notice to employees with regard to the
compensation payable for persons who are retired
for medical reasons prior to reaching age of 55.
03. In view of the failure of the Respondent to satisfy
that a circular had been issued and or valid
management, decision had been made to vary the
provisions of circular No. 4 of 1974 and with No. 5
of 1975 (R1 and R2) and in view of the admission
by the Respondent, that the applicable circulars are
above R1 and R2 my conclusion is that the
Respondent has to compensate the applicant in terms
of Section (w)(II) of the circular No. 4 of 1975 (R1)
04. Accordingly I award that the applicant is entitled to
receive as compensation a salary of 5 months and
further a salary of 12 months as he has served more
than 19 years is Rs. 215,985 (12,705x5+
12,705x12).
05. Having considered gap from the date of retirement
to date (06.11.2006 to 30.04.2015) and also the
circumstance of the applicant being paralyzed it is
considered reasonable that the Respondent should
pay legal interest on the sum awarded from the date
of retirement until the compensation is paid in full.
A
WARD
In view of above and balance of probabilities. I made
following award in respect of the matter which has been
referred to arbitration.
Therefore I award in a sum of Rs. 215,985/-
(Rs.12,705x17) as compensation and payment of legal
interest for the sum awarded from the date of retirement
06.11.2006 to the date of awarded compensation is paid in
full.
I hold that this is a fair and equitable award.
