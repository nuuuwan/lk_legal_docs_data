PART I : S EC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY  OF  THE DEMOCRATIC  SOCIALIST  REPUBLIC  OF  SRI  LANKA - 13.09.2016
4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, Chapter 131 of  of the
Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised Edition)
as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957, 62 of 1957, 4 of 1962
and 39 of 1968 read with Industrial Disputes (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968 appointed me as the
arbitrator by his Order dated 09th September 2011 and
referred the dispute between the aforesaid parties to me for
settlement by Arbitration.
2. The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is-
“Whether the demand made by Mrs. S. M. D. Jayasundara
who held the post of Senior Manager (Finance) of the
National Housing Development Authority who retired on
21.12.2009, services were terminated on 29.07.1995 after
a disciplinary inquiry and reinstated in service without a
break of service on 15.06.2004 with two years salary of
Rs. 173,520/- by an order of the Labour Tribunal, that she
has been deprived of receiving the salary and allowances
and the opportunity to face interviews for promotion during
the unemployed period can be justified and if so, to what
relief she is entitled.”
3. Mr. K. G . Navaratne, appeared on behalf of the
applicant, while Ms. R. Fernando and Ms. Diana
Kodituwakku, State Attorneys appeared on behalf of the
Respondent, National Housing Development Authority.
4.  Both Parties tendered submissions in terms of
Regulation 21(1) and 21(2). It came to light, arising from
the submissions that Labour Tribunal, per it's order in case
No. 1/44/96 of 21st April, 2004 required the Respondent
National Housing Development Authority to offer work on
15th June, 2004 and pay compensation in a sum of Rs.
173,520/- being 2 years salary, worked out on the basis of
(Rs. 7,230x12x2).
At the outset, respondent National Housing
Development Authority stated that the judicial principle “Res
judicata” applied in this case, and arbitrator cannot proceed
therefore, whereas the applicant took up the position that,
arising from the order, salary for the period of non-
employment, i. e. from 29.07.1995 to 15.06.2004, becomes
due, as the learned Labour Tribunal President used the words
“fiajfha msysgqjk f,i ” signifying reinstatement. Applicant
cites several decided cases to substantiate her argument.
5. However, following facts reveal that-
(a) Applicant assumed duties, per Labour Tribunal
order on 15th June, 2004, but took up the issue
of back wages, with the Commissioner of
Labour, after 42 months, a belated application.
(b) Labour Tribunal Order, in its 17 page judgement,
comprehensively has examined the pros and
cons of the matter and the applicant had not been
completely exonerated from the charges
levelled. In the analysis of evidence, the lapses
on the part of applicant, as well as that of
management, had taken into consideration, and
ordered payment of compensation, instead of
full back wages.
(c) If the applicant observed that Labour Tribunal
had not calculated the entire salary for the denied
period of employment, she should have appealed
to the High Court seeking relief, which she
failed to do so.
(d) Section 31(B)(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act
state that-
“Where an application under sub section (1) is
entertained by a Labour Tribunal and proceedings
thereon are taken and concluded, the workman
to whom the application relates shall not be
entitled to any other legal remedy in respect of
the matter to which that application relates, and
where he has first resorted to any other legal
remedy, he shall not thereafter be entitled to the
remedy under sub section (1)”
Relief lies only from High Court, as the Arbitrator is
not vested with revisionary jurisdiction.
In view of the reasons enumerated arbitrator cannot
grant any relief to the Applicant.
This is just and an equitable Award.

Arbitrator.
