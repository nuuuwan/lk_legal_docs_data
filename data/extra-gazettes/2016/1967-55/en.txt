Association Regulations laid down under Section  54 (3) in  the Gazette (Extraordinary)  No. 1825/ 38 dated on 30th of

de Silva, the Director General of  the Department of Sports, to convene and conduct the Election of  the Judo Association to
elect its new office bearers, due to the fact that the term of office of  the Interim committee has expired on 15.07.2015 and the
failure to hand over the letters of delegation of powers, direct to the Director General of Department of Sports during the
specified time by Sports clubs at the election of  the Sri Lanka Judo Association, and with  a view to do away with perjudical
acts that may occur in the course of election and in order to seek the active contribution of all Sprots Clubs for the
development of Judo.
