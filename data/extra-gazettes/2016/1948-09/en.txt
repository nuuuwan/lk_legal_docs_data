apply for these required extension hours on a rostered working day. However if called to work as set out in (a) hereunder, they shall

basis as with the allowance that is paid when they perform duties on a ‘day-off’.

However, on occasions and Engineer may be required for work on a day-off, they shall receive a day-off payment per hour for each
hour worked, as follows, subject to a minimum payment of 6 hours.
Grade LKR
L1 2500
L2 3000
L3/L4 3500
There shall be no entitlement for any time-off-in-lieu.
(a) If an Engineer continues to work after duty for 2 hours or more, or they are called early for duty before 02 or more hours, payment
will be made for each hour as per the rates set out above.
12.4 Flying Spanner Allowance
It is agreed that on occasions an Engineer may be required to for work on a day-off as a flying spanner. Performing flying spanner
duties means that an Engineer is required to accompany an aircraft for the purposes of certification of that aircraft at an overseas on-
line station.
In these cases when an Engineer works on a day-off to perform flying  spanner duties, they shall receive an hourly Flying Spanner
Allowance (FSA) of USD 25.00 per hour for each hour worked on a day-off, subject to a minimum payment for 4 hours which is
a minimum of USD 100.00 per occasion, and subject to a maximum payment for 15 hours which is a maximum of USD 375.00 per
occasion. The Flying Spanner Allowance (FSA) is only applicable when the Engineer goes away from Colombo and returns to
Colombo except on layover flights. There shall be no entitlement for any time-off-in-lieu.
Payment of FSA Per occasion will commence at initial chocks-off in Colombo, and will finish at the final chocks-on back in
Colombo. Actual qualifying time will then be rounded up to the nearest full hour. However, if the Engineer is away from the aircraft
(either whilst on a layover during a hotel stay away from Sri Lanka, or whilst the aircraft is grounded for any reason at the overseas
destination), then the FSA ceases from the time the Engineer leaves the aircraft at the overseas destination until returning to duty at
the aircraft at the overseas destination. However, during the said period Meal Allowance and Night stop Allowance will be
applicable as per the Company Policy.
If an Engineer is asked to perform duties as a flying spanner on a normal rostered working day, then Flying Spanner Allowance
(FSA) does not apply. Nor is there any eligibility for overtime payments for Engineers who are covered and bound by this
Agreement who have to extend a normal rostered working day by performing flying spanner duties.
The revised rates will be applicable from the date of signing the Agreement.
When an Engineer receives Flying Spanner Allowance for operating as a flying spanner on a day-off, then they do not receive any
other payment as described in section 12.3 for working on a day-off.
Business Class seat will be allocated for Engineers on all flight  observation duties only.
All Engineers who perform planned flight observation duties which consist of 15 hours or more (long sectors)minimum of 08 hours
rest should be provided with Hotel Accommodation (Lay over to be planned prior to departure from CMB).
After attending to Aircraft On Ground (AOG) situations in overseas stations where we have on line operations, if Engineers have
been working for continuous 12 hours or more, subject to possibility of arranging entry permits by the Station staff, hotel
accommodation will be provided with a minimum rest of 08 hours.
Wherever possible, Management will endeavour to provide passenger aircraft for Engineers to travel on AOG situations.
Company will provide home drops and pick-ups for the Engineers who are on or flight observer duties.
12.5 Meal Allowances as a Flying Spanner
When an Engineer goes on duty as a flying spanner (both on a normal rostered working day, and on a day-off), meal allowances will
be paid as follows:

Allowance Payment Timing
Breakfast USD 25.00 07.30-08.30
Lunch USD 25.00 12.30-13.30
Dinner USD 25.00 19.30-20.30
All time schedules for applicability of meal allowances as listed above are shown in local times (LT). Engineers will be eligible for
these meal allowances commencing one hour before scheuled departure and finishing half an hour after actual time of arrival (arrival/
departure timings same as Flight Crew).
In addition to meal allowances, for a flight departing from or returning to Colombo where an overnight stay is required at an overseas
slip location in a hotel whilst on-duty as a flying spanner, then a night-stop allowance will be paid as follows:
Night-Stop
L1-L3 USD 30.00 On-duty at 00.01 and layover included.
L4 USD 40.00 On-duty at 00.01 and layover included.
12.6 Approval Allowance
A detailed summary of all approval types and associated Approval Allowance payments that apply to locally employed permanent
engineers in grades L 1- L 4 inclusive is provided in Appendix B  to this Agreement.
The Company has the sole right to determine the number of Engineers who are required to have approval types to meet operational
requirements for aircraft of both SriLankan Airlines and other airlines certified by SriLankan Airlines.
The underlying intention and philosophy of the Company is to pay a monthly approval allowance of Rs. 15, 000 regardless of
aircraft-type for each recognised and required approval-type to any Engineer who holds a recognised approval-type and is required
to utilise that approval as part of their regular working duties on an aircraft that is part of the Sri Lankan Airlines fleet.
This same underlying philosophy of Rs. 15,000 per month per approval-type has also been used as the underlying philosophy in
determining othe types of license pay or approval pay on a relative pro-rata basis for other types of certifications and approvals.
Where the approval-type relates to a current approval on an aircraft that is in operation in the SriLankan Airlines fleet at the time of
payment, then 100% of the relevant approval allowance shall be paid. However, such payment shall immediately cease to be payable
if and when an aircraft type ceases to be in operation in the SriLankan Airlines fleet. There will be no negative impact to the
remuneration package of individual Engineers in the event of this being implemented.
The company may, if future business plans so determine, choose to phase-in or phase-out any other aircraft types at its sole discretion
and payment of Approval Allowances will apply in accordance with such phase-in and Phase-out.
Likewise, payment of Approval Allowance shall immediately cease to be payable if and when the approval held by the engineer is
no longer current or the validity of their approval expires.
Where the approval-type relates to a current approval on an aircraft that is in Scheduled operation of another airline for whom
Sri Lankan Airlines provides certification (but not in operation in the Sri Lankan Airlines fleet) at the time of payment, then 50% of
the relevant approval allowance shall be paid. However, such payment shall immediately cease to be payable if and when an aircraft
type ceases to be maintained for the other airline by  Sri Lankan Airlines. Likewise, such payment shall immediately cease to be
payable if and when the Engineer  is no longer current or the validity of their approval expires.
The overall cumulative maximum monthly approval allowance that an individual Engineer may receive in any one month shall be
Rs. 200,000 per month.

(a) If a Station Engineer is required to be away from the station for operational or urgent personal reasons approved by the
