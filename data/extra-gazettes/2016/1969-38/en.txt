However there should not be a barrier or constraint in implementing aforementioned changes. If there are unexplained losses occured, the
operators are responsible for such losses.
Extruder / Fabric calendar:
Efficiency of the machine / process is calculated based on the number of hours operated and the output generated during the particular time
of operation. Norms should be delivered on proportionate basis if the required manpower is not available.
Bias Cutter:
In case of providing electronic encoder for auto function, cutting norms should be increased and the cutter operator should be able to work
as an additional splicer. Norms should be delivered on proportionate basis if the required manpower is not available as follows.
When 4 people available- 2395 cuts
When 3 people available- 1795 cuts
Squeegee calendar:
In case of upgrading/ modernization norms should be increased. Norms should be delivered on proportionate basis if the required manpower
is not available as follows.
When 8 people available- 135 rolls
When 7 people available 117 rolls
Tyre Building:
1. Band building and Tractor Rear Tyre Building will be considered as two seperated operations. Tractor Tyre Building Machine will be
operated with one builder and one helper. They are responsible to get all required material for operation.
2. Tyre builder's / Helper's job should include following responsibilities.
(A) Helper should provide all required materials to the tyre builder to fulfill the norms.
(B) He should be directly responsibile for maximum utilization of materials and minimize wastage & scrap during the operating

ply consrtuction tyres during drum changes.
(D) Ply loading time should be 60 minutes when machine servicer is empty.
(E) All green tyres should build (assemble) as per specification & follow the SOP given by the T echnical Department in order
to maintain the quality.
(F) Green tyres should be inspected after building (assembling) to ensure the green tyres are free from defects (Eg: Should not
have blisters, open chaffer, open tread, loose cord etc.) & do the necessary corrections before removing from the depart-
ment.
(G) Operator should deliver agreed full norms with the helper.
(H) Operator should stick the Builder number in the center of the green tyre.
(I) All the Light Truck Green Tyres should store on green tyre racks by the Helper.
Green Tyre Preparation:
Weighing and supplying of prepared green tyres to the curing presses as per the agreed norms and proper storage of all green tyres built
during the shift to be maintained. The green tyre preperation crew also ensures that startup load for the next shift is prepared and supplied.
