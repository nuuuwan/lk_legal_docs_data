(b) seafarers are not trained for specific shipboard arrangements in such a way as would impair their ability to
take their skills elsewhere.
(3) In issuing any certificate under the provisions of chapter VII of the STCW  Convention, the following
principles shall be taken into account:
(a) the issue of alternative certificates shall not be used in itself:
(i) to reduce the number of crew on board,

Competency or endorsement or Certificate of Proficiency shall be performed within a period of 10 years preceding the
date of commencement of the assessment of competency and shall include a period of 12 months sea service within the
five years preceding the date of commencement of the assessment of competency.
(2) The service on non trading vessels, tugs, dredgers, research vessels, salvage vessels, navigational aids
tenders, Dynamical positioning vessels and other vessels engaged in similar activities may be counted in full, if the time
actually spent at sea constitutes or exceeds two-thirds of the total period of service onboard ship. If the actual seagoing
service falls below this proportion, one and a half times the actual seagoing service may be counted as “qualifying seagoing
service”. Candidates shall be required to produce, in addition to the evidence of sea service required of all candidates, a
statement or a certificate from the company and the Master of the ship, setting out the amount of time actually spent at
sea, with particular reference to at least six months of watch keeping service under supervision.
(3) Where such service has been performed only on particular types of vessels specified in Sub-regulation
(2), the certificates may be restricted to service on such vessels only.
(4) The officers of the Sri Lanka Navy of the marine engineering branch who intend to become holders of
Certificates of Competency as Officer-in-Charge of an engineering watch in a manned engine room or as designated duty
engineer in a periodically unmanned engine room on ships of propulsion power of 750KW or more complying with the
requirements of the Convention shall be required to complete approved relevant education, training, examination and
assessment. Such candidate’s existing experience, qualifications and certificates if any, shall form the basis for determining
qualifying merchant ship sea going service, training and assessment as determined by the Chief Examiner of Engineers.
Sea service performed on board Sri Lanka Navy ships as determined by the Chief Examiner of Engineers shall be considered
as approved sea service for examination of an Officer-in-Charge of an engineering watch in a manned engine room or
designated duty engineer in a periodically unmanned engine room on ships of propulsion power of 750KW or more.

Certificates of Competency as Officer-in-Charge of a navigational watch on ships of 500 GT or more complying with the
requirements of the Convention shall be required to complete approved relevant education, training, examination and
assessment. Such a candidate’s existing experience, qualifications and certificates if any, shall form the basis for determining
qualifying merchant ship sea going service, training and assessment as determined by the concerned Chief Examiner of
Masters and Mates. Propelling time performed on board Sri Lanka Navy ships of 500 GT or more as determined by the
relevant chief examiner will be considered as approved sea service.

Certificates of Competency as Officer-in-Charge of a navigational watch on ships of less than 3000 GT on near coastal
voyages complying with the requirements of the Convention shall be required to complete approved relevant education,
training, examination and assessment. Such a candidate’s existing experience, qualifications and certificates if any, shall
form the basis for determining qualifying merchant ship sea going service, training and assessment as determined by the
concerned Chief Examiner of Masters and Mates. Propelling time performed on board Sri Lanka Navy ships of between
500 GT and 3000 GT on near coastal voyages, as determined by the relevant Chief Examiner will be considered as approved

relevant Chief Examiner shall be considered as approved sea service.
20.  Qualifying seagoing service for deck officers and deck ratings means the time spent on board ships from the
date of engagement to the date of discharge from a ship.
21.(1) Except where otherwise is stated, qualifying seagoing service for marine engineer officers and engine
room ratings means the time spent on board ships from the date of engagement to the date of discharge on ships with
propelling machinery and or auxiliary machinery in full use subject to Sub-regulation (2) below.
(2) When part or whole of the service has been performed on ships which, for considerable periods have not
been underway, a statement from the Master of the ship shall be produced stating the time in days actually underway. In
such circumstances, qualifying seagoing service may be counted as one and half times the actual number of days spent
underway, and in no case can it exceed the actual time spent on board during the period concerned.
(3) Seagoing service performed by engineer officers employed in work practices on ships operated on other
than the traditional watch keeping routine, may be accepted as qualifying seagoing service, if the Chief Examiner concerned
is satisfied that such work practices provide equivalent experience.

be issued. The notice of eligibility shall authorise admission of the candidate to the said examination.
(3) The Director General shall notify each eligible candidate in writing of the date and place of the examination.

becoming eligible for re-examination.
23.If the Director General considers that a ship’s size and the conditions of its voyage are such as to render the
application of the full requirements of Regulations 9 (7) and 9 (8) are unreasonable or impracticable, may to that extent
exempt the Master and the Officer-in-Charge of a navigational watch on such a ship or class of ships from some of the
requirements, bearing in mind the safety of all ships which may be operating in the same waters.
24. (1) In circumstances of exceptional necessity the Director General may issue a dispensation in accordance
with Article VIII of the Convention permitting a named seafarer to serve in a specified ship, for a specified period not
exceeding 6 months, in a capacity for which he or she does not hold the appropriate certificate, if in the opinion of the
Director General, this does not cause danger to persons, property or to the environment, provided that the person to whom
the dispensation is to be issued shall be adequately qualified to satisfactorily fill the vacant post in a safe manner, to the

except in circumstances of force majeure and then only for the shortest possible period.
(2) Any dispensation granted for a post shall be granted only to a person properly certificated to fill the post
immediately below. Where certification of the post below is not required by the Convention, a dispensation may be issued
to a person whose qualification and experience are, in the opinion of the Director General, of a clear equivalence to the
requirements for the post to be filled, provided that, if such a person holds no appropriate certificate, he shall be required
to pass a test accepted by the Director General as demonstrating that such a dispensation may safely be issued. In addition,
Director Gereral shall ensure that the post in question is filled by the holder of an appropriate certificate as soon as
possible.

3 This table is not intended to address all possible shipboard conditions or potentially disqualifying medical
conditions. Approved Medical practitioners should use their professional judgment on physical abilities applicable
to the category of seafarers (such as “Deck officer” and “Engine rating”). The special circumstances of individuals
and for those who have specialized or limited duties should receive due consideration.
4 If in doubt, the medical practitioner should quantify the degree or severity of any relevant impairment by means
of objective tests, whenever appropriate tests are available, or by referring the candidate for further assessment.
5 The term “assistance” means the use of another person to accomplish the task.
6 The term “emergency duties” is used to cover all standard emergency response situations such as abandon ship or
