Greetings !
Whereas the National Salaries and Cadre Commission was established by the Presidential Directive dated March
03, 2106 in the exercise of powers vested in me by Article 33 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of
Sri Lanka.
And whereas representation of human resources in diverse fields is identified as a vital contributory factor in the
effective outcome of the Commission.
And whereas it is apparent that the diversity of membership composition of the Commission needs to be further
widened.
Now therefore, I, Maithripala Sirisena, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka reposing
great trust and confidence in the prudence, ability and fidelity of Weligodage Kumarawansa De Silva Esquire do by these
presents appoint the said Weligodage Kumarawansa De Silva Esquire as a member of the National Salaries and Cadre
Commission in terms of the aforesaid Presidential Directive.
Given at Colombo, under the seal of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on this 22nd day of December
in the year Two Thousand Sixteen.
                                                                                    By Order of His Excellency,
P. B. A
BEYKOON,
Secretary to the President.
