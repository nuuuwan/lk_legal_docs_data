131 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956 Revised
Edition), as amended by Acts Nos. 14 of 1957, 4 of 1962
and 39 of 1968 (read with Industrial Dispute - Special
Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968 hereby appointed me as
the Arbitrator by his order dated 08th January, 2013 and
referred the dispute between the aforesaid parties for
settlement by arbitration.
Historical warm up in imperative before recording the award
in that the above-said Honourable Minister had already
revoked the reference made previously to Mr. N. C. V .
Kulathunga by his order dated 28.05.2009 under the above-
said Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
The statement of the matter in dispute between the aforesaid
parties is as follows :
“ Whether any injustice was caused by the Ceylon
Electricity Board to Mr. H. D. Thilakaratne who had been
appointed to the post of its Human Resources Officer, Class
II Grade II (Special) with effect from 02.03.1999 on
consequence of the salary conversion letter dated
02.03.2004 of the said Board which was issued to him
regarding the rectification of anomalies in the salary scales
of the Non-Engineering Executive Officers and any such
injustice was caused, to what relief Mr. H. D. Thilakarathne
is entitled.”
Appearances :
Party of the First Part  :
Mr. Sanath Weerasinghe - Attorney-at-Law appears on
behalf of the Party of the First Part, who is also present.
Party of the Second Part  :
Mr. Sujith Perera, Attorney-at-Law appears on behalf
of the Party of the Second Part.
Mrs. Achini Wickramaratne, Acting Chief Legal
Officer and Mrs. Yashoda Nuwani Ariyathunga, Human
Resources Officer represent on behalf of the Ceylon
Electricity Board.
Both Parties mentioned above have submitted their
respective statements that have led to the disputes in terms
of regulations 21(1) and (2) of the Industrial Disputes
regulations 1958. Thereafter I made every endeavour to
explore a possibility of an amicable settlement which proved
to be futile.
Party of the First H. D. Thilakaratne (hereinafter
referred to as Thilakaratne) commenced to lead his sole
evidence marking documents A1 to A25. Whereas the Party
of the Second Part (hereinafter referred to as (Ceylon
Electricity Board [C. E. B]) adduced the evidence of one
Koralage Yashoda Nuwani Ariyathunga, Human Resources
Officer and concluded with documents marked RX, R1 to
R17 (inadvertently R4 to R12 had never been marked). Then
they were given time to submit written submissions
returnable on 25th January 2016.
Review of Written Submission of both Parties as well
as the evaluation of evidence reveals the factual background
to this reference and legal basis of the several reliefs sought
by Thilakaratne to be relevant to this award is as follow :
Thilakaratne joined the Ceylon Electricity Board (C.
E. B.) from the position of an Administrative Officer 1st
March, 1985 to a Personal Officer in 01st June in 1992 and
ultimately at the time of his retirements he was the Human
Resources Manager Class II Grade I effective 21st October,
1999.
Leaving out unnecessary details I would incorporate
necessary facts to be relevant  to the whole scenario,
necessary to understand and resolve the issue in question
referred to above.
At the outset documents marked A11, A16, A17 and
A18 according to proceedings dated 14.08.2015 has not been
proved by Thilakaratne and is should be rejected without
any consideration.
On 24th February 2014 an Interim Order was made
regarding consolidated salary based on A5 as at 01st March
1985 should stand at Rs. 1750/-. And all other revisions and
conversions should be based on this and this alone. All other
considerations are irrelevant and rejected forthwith.
Incidentally, this consolidated salary inclusive of two
increments recommended by the Ombudsman vide C(A3)
dated 02.02.1998).
Moreover, the order further declared reference to this
dispute will confine to matter in dispute as stated in
statement of matter in dispute.
Thilakaratne was allowed to make and amended
computation of salary anomalies dated 10th March 2014,
according to the Interim Order made 24.02.2014.
By A4 copy of salary revision dated 06.02.1998 is
made without any blemish.
Upon the request of Thilakaratne R2 (a) dated
02.06.1999 details his Duties and Responsibilities as
Personal Officer from 01.06.1992 until his retirement. It
is appended below.

With the above documents read with evidence recorded
the bone of contention of the Counsel for Thilakaratne is
with the introduction of the Human Resources Service
published by GM's circular No. 1999/GM/18/HRD dated
31st May 1999.
(A6- English version/SA6 Sinhala version)
Thilakaratne was re-designated as Human Resources Officer
Class II Grade II with effect from 02nd March 1999 by A7
dated September 1999. On application of the said A6 clause
3.2.2 he should be elevated or promoted to Human
Resources Officer Class II Grade II (Special) as per
stipulated qualifications are satisfied by him as he has had
served at Ceylon Electricity Board for 14 years. Moreover,
by A6 clause A6(a) 2:1:2:(2) of the said scheme of
recruitments and promotion he obtained full Professional
qualifications and become eligible for promotions to Human
Resources Manager Class II Grade I in terms of Clause 3:2:1
of the said scheme. He further reiterated in the course of
his Evidence-in-Chief that subsequent to an interview held
in the first quarter of 2000, he was selected to be promoted to
Class II Grade II (special) on 02.03.1999 and to the Class II
Grade I from 21st October 1999. Accordingly, with the approval
of the Board of the CEB, he was in fact appointed to Class II
Grade II (Special) from 02nd March, 1999 and to Class II Grade
1 from 21st October 1999.
As against this argument Counsel for Ceylon
Electricity Board and the Witness of K. Yashoda N.
Amarathunga - Human Resources Officer asserted with
convincing evidence in the following manner :-
Counsel, demonstrated the fact that Thilakaratne has
been given two increments as against the one which, he is
entitled (at the point of implementation of the new scheme)
and stated that, the next officer who handled his file at a
subsequent period corrected the error made earlier, It was
vehemently asserted when the new scheme of Recruitment
and Promotions was implemented the placement and or
absorption and or re-designation of the employ (Non -
Engineering Executives) took place under the supervision
of Thilakaratne and any misinterpretation of words would
be the fault on his part or his mistake as the Officer
responsible (R2(a)) detailed above.
Furthermore, Thilakaratne has been given all the
increments he is entitled and he did not make any claim till
his retirement and after few years of retirement. Moreover,
that there is no injustice caused to him, but in fact he was
given more benefits. Yashoda's evidence is plain and clear
language and adduced how the salary scale worked for Human
Resources Officers, In fact by A8's reference in PB/PO(F)/
A1/239 is him.
Accordingly, when questioned by the court referring
to A8, the proceedings of 20.04.2015 to page 3 Thilakaratne
respond thus :

It clearly shows that A8 was issued to Thilakaratne
under his supervisions.
There is no question about it. Even a general reading
of A25 reiterates and supports and confirms Yashoda's
evidence. I am satisfied with Yashoda's evidence as it is
cogent, clear, convincing and correct in its totality. Thus

her evidence out-weighs the evidence of Thilakaratne which
is inconsistent, illogical and at times evasive. Moreover,
his demeanour throws his cloudy and dubious character.
Hiding matters adverse to him and overlooks matters
benefits him. In fact, he is the second in line of authority as
regards Executive Services Officers R2(a).
The pivotal problem arose with the introduction of
A6 - English version/(S)A6 - Sinhala version, English version
is followed in this award. By the GM's circular 1999 (GM/
18/HRD dated 31.05.1999. Certain para is reproduced
verbatim hereunder as a ready reckoner. Scheme of
Recuritment and Promotions of Ceylon Electricity Board
Executive Services in K4 salary scale and above.
Accordingly, the Board decided to categories all
Executive Officers in K4 salary scale and above, of CEB
under 04 categories as a appended below :
Namely :
01. Engineering Service of the CEB.
02. Accountants and Audit Service of the CEB.
03.  Human Resources Service of the CEB.
04. Ancillary Service of the CEB.
Above said scheme of recruitment and promotion had
been approved by the Board and became operative from 02nd
March, 1999.
According to Para 1.2 Cadre :
There will be a combined cadre for Class (II) Grade
(II) and Class (II) Grade (I) of the Human Resources Service.
The cadre will be decided by Board from time to time based
on Personnel Plan.
Note : Existing designation of Personnel
Officer/Administrative Officer will be
re-designated as Human Resources
Officer Class (II) Grade (II), Vide R1.
Para 2.1.2 Qualifications and Experience

Applicants should possess  :
01. Corporate membership of the
Institute of the Personnel and
Development (IPD) UK or

or
02. Degree awarded by a recognized
University with corporate
membership of the Institute of
Personnel Management (IPM)
or

Seniority, competence and
performance after an interview on case

They will be designated as Class (II)
Grade (II) (Special). Vide A6 (3)(a).
(emphasis is mine)
The whole issue in this reference hinges on this A06
document which categorized existing designation of
Personnel Officer/Administrative Officer will be re-
designated as Human Resources Officer Class (II) Grade
(II) in K4 Executive Services category referred to above.
In fact, Deputy General Manager (Human Resources
Management) by letter- My No. : PB/PO(E)/A1/242
indicates Thilakaratne the Personnel Officer has been re-
designated as Human Resources Officer Class (II) Grade
(II) with effect from 02nd March, 1999. (A07)
Thereafter, General Manager of Ceylon Electricity

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE   EXTRAORDINARY   OF   THE   DEMOCRATIC   SOCIALIST   REPUBLIC   OF   SRI   LANKA - 06.04.2016
Resources Manager Class (II) Grade (I) of Human Resources
Service (A8). On the K2 salary scale with effect from 21st
October 1999 and the salary scale attached to the post of
Human Resources Manager is also K2 salary scale :
Namely : Rs 21,725-5x390-10x475-Rs. 27,950/- p. m.
On scrutiny the maximum salary scale deemed to be
erroneous instead of Rs. 28,425/- it is stipulated as Rs.
27,950/- p. m. which is an inadvertent error. However, it
depicts the irresponsibility of the Management.
Note :
By the same letter, A8 Thilakaratne, was also
categorically classified as absorbed as Human Resources
Officer Class (II) Grade (II) (Special) on K2 salary scale
with effect from 02nd March, 1999, At the time of  re-
designation will be analysed below.
The said letter A8 has confused Thilakaratne who was
the Personnel Officer who was handling all the duties
pertaining to Executive Services category including himself,
had been incorporated in R2 above, titled “Duties and
Responsibilities”.
In an institution when they re-structure the cadre at
the outset give a generic name followed by a specific name
herein Thilakaratne was re-designated as  Human Resources
Officer Class (II) Grade (II) operative from 02.03.1999 as
per A7. In fact, Thilakaratne had been in service and second
in the line of authority. Management thought it fit to
accommodate him and absorbed in the category referred to
as Class (II) Grade (II) (Special) category, referred to in
Para 3.2.2 and the question of Board approval was never
came in vogue as it was deemed to be a special case,
overlooking the norm R3 and the Management exercised
their discretion and considered Thilakaratne as a special case
and that is why it is categorically stated in A8 as absorbed
and placed him on K2 salary scale. There inadvertently
maximum salary scale has been erroneously indicated as
mentioned above. That is CEB's mistake of fact.
On the strength of evidence and documents related
thereto and evidence convincingly adduced by Yashoda -
Human Resoruces Officer explained this aspect quite lucidly
that Thilakaratne having power over all these matters as he
was the sole authority below the Deputy General Manager
his immediate boss. Therefore, now he cannot be heard to
say that he was unaware of it. Accordingly in terms of R2 he
is accountable for all or any of the mistake transpired or
occured. Moreover his demeanour portrays dubious
character and his evidence is incoherent in nature.
Therefore, I consider that the argument of Thilakaratne
cannot hold water. And that the Management has the
necessary discretion and authority to do what is in the best
interest of the institution even beyond what is written - vide
A6(3)(a). Must note that tere is no Board Approval in his
Personal File referred to in A6(3)(a), because it is
considered to be a special case and his referring to A21,
A22, A23 and asserting that they has been issued letters as
promotion to Class II Grade II (Special) cannot be compared
with the period and time envisaged therein. Any stretch of
imagination could satisfy in his favour. As the Counsel for
CEB asserted that if any discrimination took place
Thilakaratne should have taken steps to file a Fundamental
Rights case in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka and this is
not the forum for him to seek relief.
In the above scenario I consider that, what is referred
to in A8 stands as firm and unassailable. Therefore no
injustice has caused to Thilakaratne on that count.
Be that as it may, whether the Management did take
due care and caution and in carrying out their work and
conduct in drafting letters, conferring promotions and
correction of anomalies, should stand to test. And the
approach adopted is far too to be desired. The unhealthy
state of affairs could be confronted with two documents
marked A10 and A12 as example to highlight with regret the
indiffrenece and inertia confounded thereto.
The document A10 originated by the Deputy General
Manager (Planning and Development (Region 03) Branch,

If the  management had been a little arithmetically
oriented or clearly minded and addressed the issue referred
to them with care and caution on Correction of an anomaly
in the salary scale of non-engineering executives who have
been promoted or recruited to the service between
01.08.1990 to 19.11.1998 while Thilakaratne was in service
everything could have been solved and sealed the issue then
and there on 2nd March, 2004 well before the retirement
of Thilakaratne on 13.03.2004. Because of  this lapse
culminated in another letter from same Deputy General
Manager 10.03.2006. A12. That is response to Thilakaratne's
letter dated 31.03.2006. A13, Thereafter letters A14, A15
and A19 followed could have been avoided.
In the premises, I totally in agreement with the
evidence given by Yashoda and the Written Submission made
by her Counsel, who has endeavoured to bring to light the
issue of miscalculation and indifferent attitude of the
Management. However, it must be noted the effort taken by
the Counsel for the First Part who laboriously worked hard
and his critical thinking is appreciated as against the attitude
and dubious character of Thilakaratne.
Thilakaratne's evidence is inconsistent, illogical and
at times evasive. And his demeanour was noted from the
inception in 1985 until his retirement on 13.03.2004. He
PRINTED A T THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING , SRI LANKA
was inclined to look out for anything to his benefit. But what
had happened was when replaced by some intelligent and
hard working officer everything turned to his detriment.
Therefore, his evidence cannot be accepted. On the other
hand Yashoda - Human Resources Officer, was cogent,
collective, effective and made a clean breast of what he
knows from the documents marked and the experience
gained in the institution. Though mistake had been committed
repeatedly by top management would have been avoided.
However it is a matter of concern to be remedied sooner
than later.
The facts and circumstances very clearly depict that
there was no injustice caused to Thilakaratne either by A8
and A10 but, there are certain discrepancies resulted due to
negligence or carelessness of the management. However it
may be excused on grounds of public interest and utility of
service.
Therefore, I make no Award for the reasons stated
above.
Accordingly, I consider this award is just and equitable
in the circumstance.
                                                                   Arbitrator.
