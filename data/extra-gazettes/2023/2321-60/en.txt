46B As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent concession that meets 
the conditions in paragraph 46B is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election shall  
account for any change in lease payments resulting from the rent concession the same way 
it would account for the change applying this Standard if the c h a n g e  w e r e  n o t  a  l e a s e 
modification. 
The practical expedient in paragraph 46A applies only to rent c oncessions occurring as a 
direct consequence of the covi d-19 pandemic and only if all of the following conditions are  
met: 
(a) the change in lease payments results in revised consideration f or the lease that is 
substantially the same as, or le ss than, the consideration for the lease immediately  
preceding the change;  
(b) any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originall y due on or before 30  
June 2021 (for example, a rent concession would meet this condi tion if it  results  in  
reduced lease  payments on or before 30 June 2021 and increased lease payments that 
extend beyond 30 June 2021); and 
(c) there is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of  the lease.

(a) that it has applied the practical expedient to all rent concessions that meet the conditions 
in paragraph 46B or, if not applied to all such rent concessions, information about the 
Paragraphs 46A, 46B, 60A, C1A, C20A and C20B are added. A new he a d i n g  i s  a d d e d    b e f o r e  C 2 0 A .  F o r
