 (Of  the  One  Part)
And
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, No. 609, Dr. Danister De Silva Mawatha, Colombo 09. 
 (Of  the Other  Part)
  
            AWARD
1.  The Honorable Minister of Labor and Trade Union Relations by virtue of the powers vested in him by Section 4 (1) of the 
Industrial Disputes Act, chapter 131 of the legislative enactments of Ceylon (1956 revised edition) as amended by Acts 
Nos. 14 of 1957, 62 of 1957, 4 of 1962 and 39 of 1968 read with Industrial Disputes (special provisions) Act, No. 37 of 
1968 appointed me by his Order dated 01
st August, 2019 and referred the dispute between the aforesaid parties to me for 
settlement by arbitration.
The matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is
"whether Mr. J. jegateeswaran who worked as the supervisor of the Eastern Of ﬁ ce of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, 
interdicted from 19.10.2010 and released from all charges following the disciplinary inquiry against him had been caused 
injustice by not been paid the salary and allowances from 19.10.2010. to 02.04.2012 the period during which he had been 
interdicted and if such injustice had been caused, to what releaf he is entitled''.
2.  Respondent, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was represented by State Attorney Mrs. Gangani Liyanage, initially and 
lately by State Attorney Mrs. Thurya Roberts along With ofﬁ cials of the Corporation.
Whereas applicant failed to appear on all days of inquiry. Even failed to send in a representative, duly authorized Inquiries were 
made to ascertain as to whether he is living or dead, though Assistant Commissioner of Labor, District Labor ofﬁ ce. Batticoloa, 
and it came to light that he is sick and bedridden, unable to travel.
3. Observations and Findings
 
 a)  Applicant J. Jegateeswaran had joined the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on 19.08.1979 as a (C 6) workman and at 
the time of employment in provincial ofﬁ ce (east) Batticoloa, he was in Grade B 2.
 b)  Based On certain allegations, an investigation headed by Manager (security/investigations) reported of its involvement 
in certain acts of corruption reported on 10.10.2010.

PRINTED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING, SRI LANKA.
 f)  Applicant was reinstated on 02.04.2012
I Observe that CPC with an army of executives have taken almost 140 days to issue a charge sheet and thereafter inquiry held 
(dates unknown) and found not guilty of the commission of offence. There by reinstated on 02.04.2012, that means respondent 
had kept the workman on no-pay for 538 days (i.e. 82 in 2010, 365 in 2011 and 91 in 2012).
The Practices Followed of Public Service Private Sector And Statutory Bodies, is so  reinstate workman if found not guilty of 
the charges. Surprisingly CPC Disciplining Rules formulated in 1982, provided for Management to deprive hack wages even 
if a workman is not guilty, Chairman is empowered to decide whether to pay or not, as he wish.
In my view he is in breach of the concept of natural justice, Which say that one shall not be the judge of his own case. Chairman 
decision not to pay the due salary, is a serious unfair labor practice.
Best practices are followed in Private Sector ﬁ rms. For example.
Collective Agreements No. 09 of 1984, No. 10 of 1984, No. 11 of 1984,  No. 03 of 1985, No. 04 of 1985, No. 05 of 1985,
No. 01 of 1986
These agreements provide for the following procedure after inquiry 
 a)  The Employee shall not be dismissed, and that the employee could resume work with full back wages and other 
entitlements, A punishment which falls short of dismissal may be imposed.
 
 b)  The employee shall be dismissed effective from the date of suspension in which event that period will be without pay.
 c)  The employee is to be suspended without pay in view of the serious and involved nature of the charges, where the 
employer ﬁ nds a desirable to await the outcome of investigations and inquiries of the police or other authorities. 
 d) If the management fails to make an order within 30 days from the date of suspension the employee is entitled to half 
pay, and beyond 30 days for full pay until the management make an  order, whatever be the outcome of the inquiry.
 e)  If the management fails to make an order within 30 working days after the conclusion of the inquiry, the employee is 
to be exonerated ipso facto and no adverse inference to be drawn from such charges against the employee.
 f)  The employer is required to make an order within a period of 90 days of the date of suspension.
In Consequence of the delaying tactics of the management, the ﬁ nancial loss to the workman, applicant exceeds Rs. 800, 000.00 
(Rs. Eight Hundred Thousand) worked out on the basis that he earned Rs. 44,000/- per month, and the total period of interdicion 
is approximately 18 months totaling (Rs. 44,000 x18). Besides respondents is liable to deposit statutory entitlement of 15% on 
gross earnings. (i.e. employer contribution of 12% employee provident fund and 3% of employee trust fund).
Award
Unfortunately since applicant had been incapacitated, preventing him being present at Inquiries, no relief could be granted, 
although there is crystal clear situation of Unfair Labor Practice.
