He further stated at the comencement of A3623, when respondent suggested that aforesaid procedure to be followed the

In the circumstances after considering submissions by both part ies it was decided the order dated 27.01.2016 given under 
section 4(1) of Industrial Dispute Act, Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations has been cancelled and therefor to 
inquire this case as a new reference.
The Applicant in his evidence stated as follows.
He said this case was initially heard by the Arbitrator W.G. Deen under the reference A 3371. Since Mr. Deen was fallen sick 
case could not be concluded. And a new reference was issued und er A 3623.The Applicant stated that he joined National 
Insurance Corporation 7.05.1981 as a Messenger/Driver.In 1993 National Insurance Corporation was converted to National 
Insurance Company Ltd.
The Applicant was appointed to as a Clerk and National Insurance Corporation and subsequently conﬁ rmed on 1998.4.12.
The Applicant says according to Public Administration Circular dated 23.7.1971 “ The employees who has completed 55 
years of age in a joint Company manage by the Government will b e allowed to work till 60 years of age subject to the 
regulations of said Companies”
The Applicant said after he was absorbed to Janashakthi Insurance Company he was given a letter of Appointment in which

It was decided that the Arbitrator has no power to amend the reference by the Minister.
Respondent stated in their evidence that the Applicant has to c omply with the letter of appointment he signed with 
Janashakthi Insurance Plc in which Clause 5 state that “You will be required to retire at the age of 55.”
Both parties have ﬁ led written submission.
The Applicant has further stated as follows.
He said he joined the National Insurance Corporation in 1981, citing Public Administration Circular dated 23.7.1971 states 
that the employees of Corporation after completion of 55 years of service allowed to work till 60 years of age.
He further state in the report submitted by the government to the parliament with regard to transfer of 51% shares of National 
Insurance Corporation to Janashakthi Insurance Company in paragraph 8 and 9 states as follows:
“ As per the paragraph 3.3 (A) of the Agreement, Employees of N ational Insurance Corporation when transferred to 
Janashakthi Insurance Company, the employees should be provided  with same facilities they enjoyed at the time share 
transfer took place.”
 
”The Applicant stated in his evidence, that employees were deni ed the facilities they enjoyed under National Insurance 
Corporation after transfer of shares. (Applicants evidence dated 23.7 2018- page 5 and 6). 
The Applicant further states, whereas some other employees were  given chance to work after 55 years the Applicant were 
denied such opportunity even though he made several requests for extension of service.
In overall analysis of evidence I have come to following conclusions.
I. The Respondent Company has acted unfairly and maliciously to wards the applicant by denying him the extension of 
service.
II. Whereas when the Applicant joined National Insurance Corporation he has reasonable expectations to work till 60 years 
of age. 
III. The Respondent Company has acted unfairly and maliciously towards the applicant by not granting him the extension of 
service whereas others were given the opportunity to work after 55
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe 
(1991) that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equitable, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms 
of the contract employment. He can create new rights and introd uce new obligations between the parties. The eﬀ  ect 
of the award is to introduce terms which become implied terms o f the contract. It was pointed out that as industrial 
arbitrator creates a new contract for the future in contrasts t o a judge who enforces rights and liabilities arising out an 
existing contract. An industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditions of employment to come into force 
in the future when he cannot get the parties to agree to them in contrast to a judge who determines the existing right and 
liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my ﬁ nding that the Respondent Company (party of the second part) h as caused injustice to 
the applicant. (party of the First part).
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the First 
part:
be paid a sum of Rupees One Million Four Hundred and Forty Nine Thousand One Hundred and Fifty Two and cents eight 
(Rs. 1,449,152.08) being salary for the years 2009,2010,2011,20 12,2013 and 2014 along with the EPF, ETF and Gratuity 
for the said period.
