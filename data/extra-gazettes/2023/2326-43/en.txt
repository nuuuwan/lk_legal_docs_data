INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka     
    
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements        
        
Opinion 
       
I have audited the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka 
(the Institute), which comprise the Statement of ﬁ nancial position as at December 31, 2022, and the Statement 
of comprehensive income, Statement of changes in funds and reserves, and Statement of cash ﬂ ows for the

have also audited the statements of Financial Position of F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial 
Price Fund as at 31 December 2022.        
        
In my opinion, so far as appears from my examination, the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair 
view of the ﬁ nancial position of the Institute, F B Lander Prize Fund and Cyril E Begbie Memorial Prize Fund as at

December 31, 2022  and ﬁ nancial performance of the Institute  and its cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.        
        
Basis for Opinion
        
I conducted the audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent 
of the Institute in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) that 
are relevant to my audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, and I have fulﬁ lled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.
Other Information
        
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report, but does not include the ﬁ nancial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.     
 
My opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.        
        
In connection with my audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁ nancial statements or my knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated, If, based on the work we have performed, I conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard. 
       
        
Responsibilities of Management and those who charged with governance for the Financial Statements  
      
Management is responsible for the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal controls as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of ﬁ nancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance 
are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s ﬁ nancial reporting process.      
  
        
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements       
 
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in ﬂ uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these ﬁ nancial statements.
             
As part of the audit in accordance with SLAuSs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. I also:        
        
 • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud and error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf ﬁ cient and 
appropriate to prove a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, or fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omission, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

 • Obtaining an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Institute’s internal controls. 
      
 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 
      
 • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
signiﬁ cant doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion . My conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
       
 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁ nancial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the ﬁ nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.       
        
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements       
 
I communicate with those who charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and signi ﬁ cant audit ﬁ ndings, including any signi ﬁ cant de ﬁ ciencies in internal 
controls that I identify during the audit.

material uncertainties that may cast a signiﬁcant doubt upon the ability of the Institute to continue as a going concern. 
The Council has considered the consequences of current economic crisis of the country, other events, and conditions 
in determining the going concern.  Accordingly, the Council has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern and 
is satisﬁed that it has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future. Further, the Council is not aware of 
any material uncertainties that may cast signi ﬁcant doubt upon the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Therefore, the Financial Statements of the Institute continued to be prepared on a going concern basis.
1.4 Financial Period
The ﬁnancial period of the Institute represents a twelve-month period from 1
st January 2022 to 31st December 2022.
1.5 Accounting for Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) 
APFASL has been set up jointly with the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy (IPFDA) 
and The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) in 2012, to enhance the capacity of public 
sector ﬁnancial management professionals. Both CA Sri Lanka and IPFDA have equally contributed Rs. 10mn 
as initial investment for this project. In terms of paragraph 5.9 of the Articles of Constitution of APFASL, on 
the occasion of dissolution, the fund will either be spent for collective welfare purpose or be granted towards any 
good cause as the general membership feels best.
The assets and liabilities of Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL) which had been 
amalgamated with the Institute ﬁnancials up to year 2015 have been de- recognised from the ﬁnancial statements 
of the Institute from the year 2016 due to the amendment of certain clauses and provisions of the Constitution of 
APFASL in order to operate as a more autonomous entity.
When determining that there is no requirement for consolidation, the consideration has been drawn to all factors 
and circumstances in SLFRS 10 - “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Paragraph 7) as follows;
(a) power over the investee
(b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Accordingly, Management has determined that the Institute does not have exposure, or rights to variable returns 
from its involvement with AAT or APFASL. Hence there is no requirement for consolidation. 
1.6 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
1.6.1 Statement of Compliance
The ﬁnancial statements of the Institute have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards 
issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
These ﬁnancial statements comprise the statement of ﬁnancial position, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in funds and reserves, statement of cash ﬂows and notes to the ﬁnancial statements.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the ﬁnancial statements unless otherwise 
stated.

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 06.04.2023
11A
1.6.2 Basis of Measurement
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost basis, except where 
appropriate disclosures are made with regard to fair value under relevant notes.
1.6.3 Comparative Information
Comparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of 
the previous period for all amounts reported in the ﬁnancial statements, in order to enhance the understanding of 
the ﬁnancial statements of the current period and to improve comparability.
Where necessary, comparative ﬁgures have been rearranged to conform to the current year’s presentation.
1.6.4 Responsibility and Approval of Financial Statements
The Council of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka acknowledges their responsibility for the 
ﬁnancial statements and ﬁnancial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Council at the 
meeting held on 27 March 2023. 
1.6.5 Materiality and Aggregation
Each material class of similar items is presented separately in the ﬁnancial statements. Items of a dissimilar 
nature or function are presented separately, unless they are immaterial.
1.6.6 Functional and Presentation Currency
The ﬁnancial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Institute’s functional and presentation 
currency, in the primary economic environment in which the Institute operates.
All ﬁnancial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless 
stated otherwise.
1.7 Signi ﬁcant Accounting Estimates and Judgments
The preparation and presentation of ﬁnancial statements, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, 
requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates and judgments used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about signi ﬁcant areas of estimates, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effects on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements is as follows.
a) De ﬁned Beneﬁt Plans
The cost of the retirement bene ﬁt plan of employees is determined using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) 
method. Such method involves use of assumptions concerning the rate of interest, rate of salary increase and 
retirement age. Due to the long-term nature of the plan, such estimates are subject to signiﬁcant uncertainty.

b) Estimating the Incremental Borrowing Rate
As the Institute cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, it uses its incremental borrowing 
rate (IBR) to measure the lease liabilities. IBR is rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow 
similar facility from a ﬁ nancial institution.
c) Changes in Accounting Estimates and Judgments
Any changes in accounting estimates and critical judgements are disclosed in the relevant notes to the 
ﬁnancial statements.
 Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
2.1 Assets and the Bases of Their Valuation
 Property, Plant and Equipment
a Basis of Recognition and Measurement
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with 
the asset will ﬂow to the Institute and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
All property, plant and equipment are stated initially at cost and subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Repair and maintenance cost are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
b Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated by using a straight-line method on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, 
in order to write-off such amounts over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows;
Asset Category Useful Life
(Years)
Buildings 50
Furniture 5- 10
Plant and Machinery 5-10
Motor vehicles 10
Computers 5
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset 
is classiﬁed as held for sale and the date that the asset is derecognised.
Signiﬁcant items of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are separately identi ﬁed and 
depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment purchased through restricted funds is charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income. The correspondent grant amount is amortised over the useful life of 
the related asset.

13A
a Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Institute recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-
use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less 
any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The estimated useful lives of right of use assets are as follows;
Asset Category Useful Life (Years)
Right of use asset 10
Improvements to Right of use asset 10
Depreciation of improvement to right of use asset is calculated based on the remaining lease period.
At the commencement date of the lease the Institute recognises lease liability measured at the present value 
of the lease payments to be made over the lease term, the lease payments include ﬁxed payments (including 
in-substance ﬁxed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on 
an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Institute and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reﬂects the Institute exercising the option 
to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses 
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.  
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Institute uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The 
Institute uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Institute determines its incremental 
borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from the Institute’s internal records. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reﬂect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease 
payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modiﬁcation, 
a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from 
a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset. 
d Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and included in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year, the asset is derecognised.
 Library Books
Cost of library books are written off on the straight-line basis over a period of three years.
2.1.3 Capital Work-In-Progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. These are expenses of a capital nature, 
directly incurred in the construction of property, plant and equipment awaiting capitalisation. Capital work-

in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset category in property, plant and equipment, when it is 
available for use i.e., when it is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the Institute.
 Intangible Assets
a Computer Software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use. 
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life of ﬁve to ten (5-10) years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identiﬁable and unique software products controlled by 
the Institute are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
1. it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
2. Management intends to complete the software product and use it;
3. there is an ability to use the software product;
4. it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic bene ﬁts;
5. adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software 
product are available; and
6. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development 
employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Costs recognized as intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed ten 
(10) years. Costs relating to development of software are carried in capital work in progress until the software is 
ready for use.
b Study Material
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of curriculum and study materials of the CA qualiﬁcations 
are recognised as intangible assets when it is technically feasible to implement the new curriculum, the 
investment attributable to the project during its development period can be reliably measured and it can be 
demonstrated that it will generate probable future economic beneﬁts.
These costs are amortised over the effective period of the curriculum and the remaining useful life is reviewed 
at least at each ﬁnancial reporting year end.
2.1.5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for obsolete and 
slow-moving items. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the 
estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on weighted average cost. 
The cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location 
and condition.
The inventories of the Institute include study packs, study material, publications, stationery and consumables.

15A
 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
The Institute assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such 
indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Institute makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash in ﬂows 
that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value, using a discount 
rate that reﬂects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk speciﬁc to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the assets recoverable amount, since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot “exceed” the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
 Financial Assets - Initial Recognition and Measurement
a SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments
SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 on “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1
st January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting 
for ﬁnancial instruments: classiﬁcation and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting.
b Financial Assets
The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition depends on the ﬁnancial asset’s contractual cash ﬂow 
characteristics and the Institute’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient, 
the Institute initially measures ﬁnancial assets at their fair value plus transaction costs. Trade receivables that 
do not contain a signi ﬁcant ﬁnancing component for which the Institute has applied the practical expedient 
are measured at the transaction price determined under SLFRS 15.
 In order for a ﬁnancial asset to be classiﬁed and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash ﬂows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Institute’s business model for managing ﬁnancial assets refers to how it manages ﬁnancial 
assets in order to generate cash ﬂows. The business model determines whether cash ﬂows will result from 
collecting contractual cash ﬂows or selling the ﬁnancial assets or both.
(b) Financial Assets (Contd….)
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial 
Position, if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 The ﬁnancial assets of the Institute include receivables, loans and advances to staff, ﬁxed deposits held to 
collect contractual cash ﬂows, government securities, repurchase agreements and cash and cash equivalents.
 The Institute’s ﬁnancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost upon satisfaction of both of the 
following conditions:
a) The ﬁnancial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold ﬁnancial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash ﬂows and

<!-- page 16 -->

I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2023'04'06
PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 06.04.2023
16A
b) The contractual terms of the ﬁnancial assets give rise on speci ﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
Accordingly, ﬁnancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) 
method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in pro ﬁt or loss when the asset is 
derecognised, modiﬁed or impaired.
 Derecognition of Financial Assets
A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a ﬁnancial asset or part of an Institute of similar ﬁnancial assets) 
is primarily derecognised when:
· The rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset have expired; or
· The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to
pay the received cash ﬂows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement;
and either
a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂows from an asset or has entered into a pass- through 
arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Institute continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In 
that case, the Institute also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are 
measured on a basis that reﬂects the rights and obligations that the Institute has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of 
the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Institute could be 
required to repay.
 Impairment of Financial Assets
The Institute recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments measured at 
amortized cost.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash ﬂows due in accordance with the contract and all 
the cash ﬂows that the Institute expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest 
rate. The expected cash ﬂows will include cash ﬂows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements 
that are integral to the contractual terms.
For trade receivables, the Institute applies a simpliﬁed approach in calculating ECLs.
 Reclassiﬁcation
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost as the Management intends to hold these instruments to collect 
the contractual cash ﬂows upon completion of the SPPI test and evaluating the historical data. As of 01
st January 
2018, the Institute has elected the business model of hold to collect the contractual cash ﬂows and measured the 
instruments at amortized cost.

17A
Financial assets are not reclassi ﬁed subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare 
circumstances when the Institute changes its objective of the business model for managing such ﬁnancial assets.
Consequent to the change in the business model if any, the Institute reclassiﬁes all affected assets prospectively 
from the ﬁrst day of the next reporting period (the reclassiﬁcation date). Prior periods are not restated.
 Financial Liabilities
All ﬁnancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss. The Institute does not have ﬁnancial liabilities other than payables for the year ended 31st December 2022.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Institute considers cash in hand as amounts due from banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less to be “Cash and cash equivalents”. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits at bank and repurchase agreements.
Bank overdraft is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash 
ﬂows, which has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’.
2.2 Liabilities and Provisions
A liability is classi ﬁed as current when it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or there is no 
unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. The 
Institute classiﬁes all other liabilities as non-current.
2.2.1  Deferred Income
Deferred income results when invoices relating to courses and study programmes are raised at the commencement 
of the courses where the course delivery take place over a period of several months. Deferred income is recognized 
in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of course delivery taken place and the balance attributable 
to the remaining course period is recognized as a liability on the statement of ﬁnancial position until income is 
recognized.
2.2.2 Provisions
A provision is recognized in the statement of ﬁnancial position, when Institute has a legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an out ﬂow of assets will be required to settle the obligation and the 
obligation can be measured reliably.
2.2.3 Employee Bene ﬁts
(a) Employee Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plan - Gratuity
Deﬁned bene ﬁt plan is a post-employment bene ﬁt plan, other than a de ﬁned contribution plan. The 
deﬁned beneﬁt is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. The 
present value of the de ﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outﬂows, using interest rates that are denominated in the currency in which the bene ﬁts will be paid 
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. The present value of 
the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions about discount rate, future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to 
the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to signiﬁcant uncertainty. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date. Accordingly, the employee beneﬁt liability is based on the actuarial

valuation as of 31 December 2022. The Institute’s accounting policy for gratuity is to recognise actuarial 
gains and losses in the period in which they occur in full in the statement of other comprehensive income. 
(b) Deﬁned Contribution Plans- Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund
Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund 
Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. These are recognized as an expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The Institute contributes 15% and 3% of gross 
emoluments of the employees to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively.
2.2.4 Taxation
a) Income Tax
The provision for current taxation has been computed in accordance with the Inland Revenue Act No 24 
of 2017 and as amended subsequently by Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 45 of 2022.
b) Deferred Taxation
Since the Institute is not carrying on a trade or business capital allowances have not been claimed against 
the liable income and there are no tax losses to be set off against any future taxable income. Deferred tax 
has not been provided in the ﬁnancial statements.
2.2.5 Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in currencies other than Sri Lankan Rupees are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at rates which 
approximate the actual rates at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets (including securities) 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange at 
that date. Non - monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated 
at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Realized and unrealized exchange differences are 
reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
2.3 Accounting for the Receipt and Utilization of Funds, Grants and Reserves
The Institute received various grants for speci ﬁc development activities. Funds, grants and reserves have been 
classiﬁed as unrestricted funds, restricted funds and endowment funds.
 Unrestricted Funds
Unrestricted funds are those that are available for use by the Institute at the discretion of the Council and 
funds that are designated for a speci ﬁc purpose by the Council in furtherance of the general objectives of the 
Institute. Allocations made by the Council for the credit of the designated funds are charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income. Surplus funds are transferred from restricted funds to unrestricted funds in terms of the 
relevant donor agreements or with the subsequent approval of the donor.
Contributions and donations received from the general public are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income at the time of receipt, where there are no terms of references.
Designated Funds
Unrestricted funds designated by the Council to a speci ﬁc purpose are identi ﬁed as  designated funds. The 
Institute has accounted the following funds as designated funds and the purpose of such funds are elaborated 
as follows:

The method adopted for accounting for Government grant is income approach, where the grant relating to non-
depreciable asset is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is treated as deemed cost of the land at the date of the recognition of Government grant given in 
the ﬁnancial statements.
2.3.4.2 Revenue Grants
Other grants are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements at their fair value. When the grant or subsidy relates to 
an expense it is recognised as an income over the period necessary to match it with the costs, which is intended 
to compensate for on a systematic basis.
Grants and subsidies related to assets are generally deferred in the statement of ﬁnancial position and credited 
to the statement of comprehensive income over the useful life of the asset.
2.4 Statement of Comprehensive Income
2.4.1 Income Recognition
(a) Income
The sources of revenue of CA Sri Lanka are recognised as per SLFRS 15 on “ Revenue from contracts with
customers”. Accordingly, SLFRS 15 establishes ﬁve step model to account for revenue recognition at an
amount that re ﬂect the consideration where CA Sri Lanka expects to provide services to its stakeholders.
The Institute has adopted SLFRS 15 using the full retrospective method based on the assessment performed
and decided that the impact is not material to the ﬁnancial statements and therefore adjustment has not
been made in the retained earnings opening balance of the statement of changes in funds and reserves.
In terms of SLFRS 15, Revenue is recognised upon satisfactory performance obligation
is achieved. CA Sri Lanka expects that, the revenue recognition to occur over time where
stakeholders (mainly students and members) simultaneously receive and consume the bene ﬁts
provided by CA Sri Lanka and when the Institute has an enforceable right to receive payment for
performance completed. Otherwise, the revenue of the Institute is recognised at point in time.

Total provision made during the year
Under the Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983, gratuity liability arises only upon an employee completing a continuous service of 
ﬁ ve years.
14.2 Principal actuarial assumptions used 
                
              Actuarial and Management Consultants (Pvt) Ltd., qualiﬁ ed actuaries carried out an actuarial valuation on the deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t plan-gratuity as at 31 December 2022. The assumptions used in determining the cost of retirement beneﬁ ts are as 
follows.
Assumption 2022 2021
Discount interest rate * 19% per annum 11.3% per annum
Staff turnover rate 17% per annum 13% per annum
Salary increment rate 7.0% 7.0%
Retirement age 60 years 60 years
*
In the absence of a deep market in long term bonds in Sri Lanka, a long term interest rate of 19% p.a ( 2021 - 11.3% p.a) 
has been used to discount future liabilities considering anticipated long term rate of inﬂ ation.
14.3 Sensitivity analysis
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used with all 
other variables held constant in the retirement beneﬁ t obligation measurement.
