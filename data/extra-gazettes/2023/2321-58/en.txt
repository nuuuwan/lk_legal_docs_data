Application of the recognition and measurement rules
...
Onerous contracts
...
68 This Standard defines an onerous contract as a contract in wh ich the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under the contract ex ceed the economic benefits exp ected to be received under it. The 
unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the 
lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.
68A The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that r elate directly to the contract. Costs that relate 
directly to a contract consist of both:
(a) the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract ‚Äîfor example, direct labour and materials; and
(b) an allocation of other costs t hat relate directly to fulfill ing contracts ‚Äîfor example, an
allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in
fulfilling that contract among others.
69 Before a separate provision for an onerous contract is establ ished, an entity recognises any 
impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that u sed in fulfilling the contract (see 
LKAS 36).
...
Transitional provisions
...
94A Onerous Contracts‚ÄîCost of Fulfilling a Contract , issued in May 2020, added paragraph 68A and 
amended paragraph 69. An entity shall apply those amendments to  contracts for which it has not yet 
fulfilled all its obligations at the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the 
amendments (the date of initial application). The entity shall not restate comparative information. 
Instead, the entity shall recognise the cumulative effect of in itially applying the amendments as an 
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other component of equity, as appropriate, 
at the date of initial application.

105 Onerous Contracts‚ÄîCost of Fulfilling a Contract , issued in May 2020, added paragraphs 68A and
