3A 
 
SCHEDULE ‘A’ OF THE CUSTOMS ORDINANCE 
 
Prescribed under Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 235) 
 
1. Schedule A, being the “Table of Duties” (including the list of concessions and the list of exemptions), is comprised of a lis t of 
commodities and groups of commodities, and rates of duties prescribed for each commodity or group of commodities. 
 
2.  (i) The said list of commodities is in accordance with the “Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System 
(2022 Version)” (hereinafter referred to as the  “Harmonized System”), established by international convention, to 
which, Sri Lanka is a signatory.  The Harmonized System is comprised of the headings and subheadings consisting of 
commodities or groups of commodities, numerical codes assigned for those headings and subheadings, both categories 
arranged in to Sections and Chapters with some Sections, Chapters, and Subheadings having preceding Legal Notes, 
and the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System.  The said 
Subheadings are identified by six-digit numerical codes known as Harmonized System Codes or Commodity Codes. 
 
(ii) Depending upon the national requirements, the list of commodities referred to in paragraph (i) above is further 
subdivided at national  level by creating National Subdivisions under Harmonized System Codes.  Such National 
Subdivisions are identified by sub-commodity codes comprised of eight-digits. 
 
3. For determination of the duty rate or rates applicable for any goods, wares or merchandise, hereinafter referred to as commodities, 
the same shall be classified in the said list of commodities, and the appropriate Harmonized System Code shall be selected. 
 
4. Where a commodity code is subdivided at national level, it shall be mandatory to classify the commodity beyond the six digit level, 
down to the lowest hierarchical national level. 
 
5. The classification of the commodities in the nomenclature down to the sixth digit level (to determine the appropriate Harmonized 
System Code) shall be governed by the principles set out under the General Rules for the interpretation (GRI) of the Harmonized 
System. 
 
6. For the purposes of paragraph 05, due reference shall also be made to the Explanatory Notes to the said Harmonized System. 
 
7. Where nationally subdivided, the classification beyond the six-digit level shall be governed by the following principles: 
 
(i) Where the National Subdivisions (NSD) are created at two hierarchical levels and identified by three dashes (“Three -
dash NSD”) and four dashes (“Four -dash NSD”) r espectively preceding the text, the Three -dash NSD shall be 
considered as hierarchically higher to the Four-dash NSD.  First the applicable Three-dash NSD under the appropriate 
Harmonized System Code shall be selected and thereafter the applicable Four-dash NSD under the selected Three-dash 
NSD shall be selected. 
 
(ii) The classification among the NSD shall be according to the text of each subdivision, but shall be governed - mutatis 
mutandis - by the provisions of GRI; the text providing the most specific descr iption shall determine the appropriate 
NSD.  For that purpose, Three-dash NSD are comparable only with the other Three-dash NSD created under the same 
six-digit code (Harmonized System Code); likewise, Four dash NSD are comparable only with the other Four -dash 
NSD created under the same Three-dash NSD. 
 
(iii) NSD shall be considered in the same numeric sequence as they appear in the Table of Duties.  All preceding subdivisions 
under the selected six-digit code should be considered  in their numerical sequence and  exhausted, before choosing a 
particular NSD, as indicated in subparagraph (ii) above. 
 
8. Every commodity so classified down to the lowest hierarchical level, shall be levied, subject to provisions of paragraph 09 (i), (ii) 
and (iii) respectively, with the G eneral Rate of duty or the Preferential Rate of duty where applicable, prescribed against the 
respective Commodity Code (Harmonized System Code) or the NSD Code appropriate for that commodity. 
 
9. For the purposes of paragraph 08,  
 
(i) wherever more than one General Rate of duty is specified, the rate that accrues the highest amount of duty shall apply, 
unless specified otherwise. 
 
(ii) wherever a Preferential Rate and a General Rate of duty are prescribed for any commodity, the Preferential Rate shall 
be levied provided that the commodity is proved to the satisfaction of the Director General of Customs to have been 
produced or manufactured in the respective country or groups of countries as prescribed and are in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the resolution prescribing such Preferential Rate or rates, as published in the Gazette. 
 
(iii) during the implementation of Tariff Liberalization Programme of a Free Trade Agreement, to which Sri Lanka is a 
party, if the rate of duty of a commodity reflected in the Column (4) of the Schedule against the respective Free Trade 
Agreement is more than the General Rate of Duty reflected in the Column (5) of the Schedule, then the General Rate 
of Duty shall be applied 
 
10. Where the commodities qualify for concessionary rates listed in Annex-1 to schedule “A”, the commodities shall be levied with 
the concessionary rates; where the commodities are qualified for exemptions as per list of exemptions in Annex-II, the commodity 
shall be exempted from such duties.  For purpose of this paragraph, Director General of Customs shall be the final authority as for 
deciding whether the commodity qualifies for such concession or exemption.

10A 
GENERAL RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION  
OF THE HARMONIZED SYSTEM 
 
 
Classification of goods in the Nomenclature shall be governed by the following principles: 
   
1. The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub -Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, 
classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes 
and, provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions: 
  
2. (a)  Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a  reference to that article incomplete or 
unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of 
the complete or finished article.  It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or 
finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rul e), presented unassembled 
or disassembled. 
  
(b)  Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or 
combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances.  Any reference to go ods of 
a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of 
such material or substance.  The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance 
shall be according to the principles of rule 3. 
 
3. When by application of rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more 
headings, classification shall be effected as follows : 
  
(a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more 
general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or 
substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, 
those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives 
a more complete or precise description of the goods. 
  
(b)  Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different compon ents, and 
goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as 
if they consisted of the  material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this 
criterion is applicable. 
  
(c)  When goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or 3 (b), they shall be classified under the heading 
which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 
 
4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate 
to the goods to which they are most akin. 
  
5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein: 
  
(a) Camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and similar 
containers,specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long -term 
use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when 
of a kind normally sold  therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole 
its essential character. 
  
(b) Subject to the provisions of rule 5 (a) above, packing materials and packing containers presented with the 
goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. 
However, this     provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly 
suitable for repetitive use. 
 
6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the 
terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the 
understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule the relative 
section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.

Chapter 8 
 
Edible fruit and nuts; peel of citrus fruit or melons 
Notes. 
 
1.-  This Chapter does not cover inedible nuts or fruits. 
 
2.-   Chilled fruits and nuts are to be classified in the same headings as the corresponding fresh fruits and nuts. 
 
3.-   Dried fruit or dried nuts of this Chapter may be partially rehydrated, or treated for the following purposes : 
 
  (a)  For additional preservation or stabilisation (for example, by moderate heat treatment, sulphuring, the 
  addition of sorbic acid or potassium sorbate), 
 
  (b)  To improve or maintain their appearance (for example, by the addition of vegetable oil or small  
  quantities of glucose syrup),  
 
  provided that they retain the character of dried fruit or dried nuts. 
 
 
4.-  Heading 08.12 applies to fruits and nuts which have been treated solely to ensure their provisional preservation 
during transport or storage prior to use (for example, by sulphur dioxide gas, in brine, in sulphur water or in other 
preservative solutions), provided they remain unsuitable for immediate consumption in that state.

Cereals 
Notes. 
 
1.-   (A)  The products specified in the headings of this Chapter are to be classified in those headings only if grains 
  are present, whether or not in the ear or on the stalk. 
 
(B)  The Chapter does not cover grains which have been hulled or otherwise worked. However, rice, husked, 
milled, polished, glazed, parboiled or broken remains classified in heading 10.06.  Similarly, quinoa 
from which the pericarp has been wholly or partly removed in order to seperate the saponin, but which 
has not undergone any other processes, remains classified in heading 10.08. 
 
2.-   Heading 10.05 does not cover sweet corn (Chapter 7). 
 
Subheading Note. 
 
1.-   The term “durum wheat” means wheat of the Triticum durum species and the hybrids derived from the inter-
 specific crossing of Triticum durum which have the same number (28) of chromosomes as that species.

Subheading Notes. 
 
1.-  For the purposes of subheading 1602.10, the expression “homogenised preparations” means preparations of meat, 
meat offal, blood or insects, finely homogenised, put up for retail sale as food suitable for infants or young children 
or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this 
definition no account is to be taken of small quantities of any ingredients which may have been added to  the 
preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations may contain a small quantity of visible 
pieces of meat, meat offal or insects. This subheading takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading 16.02. 
 
2.-  The fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates specified in the subheadings of 
 heading 16.04 or 16.05 under their common names only, are of the same species as those mentioned in Chapter 3 
 under the same name.

Chapter 26 
 
Ores, slag and ash 
Notes. 
 
1.-  This Chapter does not cover : 
 (a)  Slag or similar industrial waste prepared as macadam (heading 25.17); 
 (b)  Natural magnesium carbonate (magnesite), whether or not calcined (heading 25.19); 
 (c)  Sludges from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, consisting mainly of such oils (heading  
  27.10); 
 (d)  Basic slag of Chapter 31; 
 (e)  Slag wool, rock wool or similar mineral wools (heading 68.06); 
 (f)  Waste or scrap of precious me tal or of metal clad with precious metal; other waste or scrap 
  containing precious metal or precious metal compounds, of a kind used principally for  
  the recovery of precious metal (heading 71.12); or 
 (g)  Copper, nickel or cobalt mattes produced by any process of smelting (Section XV). 
 
2.-  For the purposes of headings 26.01 to 26.17, the term “ores” means minerals of mineralogical species actually used 
 in the metallurgical industry for the extraction of mercury, of the metals of heading 28.44 or of  the metals of 
 Section XIV or XV, even if they are intended for non -metallurgical purposes. Headings 26.01 to 26.17 do not, 
 however, include minerals which have been submitted to processes not normal to the metallurgical industry. 
 
3.-  Heading 26.20 applies only to : 
 
 (a)  Slag, ash and residues of a kind used in industry either for the extraction of metals or as a basis 
  for the manufacture of chemical compounds of metals, excluding ash and residues from the 
  incineration of municipal waste (heading 26.21); and 
 
 (b)  Slag, ash and residues containing arsenic, whether or not containing metals, of a kind used 
  either for the extraction of arsenic or metals or for the manufacture of their chemical  
  compounds. 
 
Subheading Notes. 
 
1.-  For the purposes of subheading 2620.21, “leaded gasoline sludges and leaded anti-knock compound sludges” mean 
 sludges obtained from storage tanks of leaded gasoline and leaded anti -knock compounds (for example, tetraethyl 
 lead), and consisting essentially of lead, lead compounds and iron oxide. 
 
2.-  Slag, ash and residues containing arsenic, mercury, thallium or their mixtures, of a kind used for the extraction of 
 arsenic or those metals or for the manufacture of their chemical compounds, are to be classified in subhea ding 
 2620.60.

Chapter 27 
 
Mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation; 
bituminous substances; mineral waxes 
Notes. 
 
1.-  This Chapter does not cover : 
 
(a)  Separate chemically defined organic compounds, other than pure methane and propan e which 
are to be classified in heading 27.11; 
(b)  Medicaments of heading 30.03 or 30.04; or 
(c)  Mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 33.01, 33.02 or 38.05. 
 
2.-  References in heading 27.10 to “petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous miner als” include not only 
petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly 
of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained by any process, provided that the weight of the non -aromatic 
constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents. 
 
However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 % by volume distils at 300 
°C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter 39). 
 
3.-  For the purposes of heading 27.10, “waste oils” means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained 
from bituminous minerals (as described in Note 2 to this Chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include: 
 
(a)  Such oi ls no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used 
hydraulic oils and used transformer oils); 
(b)  Sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high 
concentration of additives ( for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary 
products; and 
(c)  Such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting 
  from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.

Subheading Notes. 
 
1.-   For the purposes of subheading 2701.11, “anthracite” means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral -
 matter-free basis) not exceeding 14 %. 
 
2.-   For the purposes of subheading 2701.12, “bituminous  coal” means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, 
 mineral-matter-free basis) exceeding 14 % and a calorific value limit (on a moist, mineral -matterfree basis) equal 
 to or greater than 5,833 kcal/kg. 
 
3.-   For the purposes of subheadings 2707.1 0, 2707.20, 2707.30 and 2707.40 the terms “benzol (benzene)”, “toluol 
 (toluene)”, “xylol (xylenes)” and “naphthalene” apply to products which contain more than 50 % by weight of 
 benzene, toluene, xylenes or naphthalene, respectively. 
 
4.-   For the purposes of subheading 2710.12, “light oils and preparations” are those of which 90 % or more by volume 
 (including losses) distil at 210 °C according to the ISO 3405 method (equivalent to the ASTM D 86 method). 
 
5.-   For the purposes of the subheadings of hea ding 27.10, the term “biodiesel” means mono -alkyl esters of fatty acids 
 of a kind used as a fuel, derived from animal  , vegetable or microbial fats and oils whether or not used.

(c)  The products mentioned in (a) above dissolved in other solvents provided that the solution 
constitutes a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for 
reasons of safety or for transport and that the solvent does no t render the product particularly 
suitable for specific use rather than for general use; 
(d)  The products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above with an added stabiliser (including an anti-caking 
agent) necessary for their preservation or transport; 
(e)  The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c) or (d) above with an added anti -dusting agent or a 
colouring substance added to facilitate their identification or for safety reasons, provided that 
the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for speci fic use rather than for 
general use.

compounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the 
Chapter; and 
(3)  Co-ordination compounds, other than products classifiable in sub-Chapter XI or 
heading 29.41, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in 
Chapter 29, among those appropriate to the fragments formed by "cleaving" of all metal 
bonds, other than metal-carbon bonds. 
 
(D)  Metal alcoholates are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case 
of ethanol (heading 29.05). 
 
(E)  Halides of carboxylic acids are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acids. 
 
6.-  The compounds of headings 29.30 and 29.31 are organic compounds the molecules of which contain, in addition to 
atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other non -metals or of metals (such as sulphur, arsenic or lead) 
directly linked to carbon atoms. 
 
Heading 29.30 (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading 29.31 (other organo-inorganic compounds) do not include 
sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart from hydrogen, oxygen and 
nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of 
sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivatives). 
 
7.-  Headings 29.32, 29.33 and 29.34 do not include epoxides with a three -membered ring, ketone peroxides, cyclic 
polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes, anhydrides of polybasic carboxyli c acids, cyclic esters of polyhydric 
alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids, or imides of polybasic acids. 
 
These provisions apply only when the ring -position hetero -atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclising 
function or functions here listed. 
 
8.-  For the purposes of heading 29.37 : 
 
(a)  the term “hormones” includes hormone -releasing or hormone -stimulating factors, hormone 
inhibitors and hormone antagonists (anti-hormones); 
 
(b)  the expression “used primarily as hormones” applies not only to hormone derivatives and 
structural analogues used primarily for their hormonal effect, but also to those derivatives and 
structural analogues used primarily as intermediates in the synthesis of products of this heading. 
 
Subheading Notes. 
 
1.-  Within any one heading of this Chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are 
to be classified in the same subheading as that compound (or group of compounds) provided that they are not more 
specifically covered by any other subheadi ng and that there is no residual subheading named “Other” in the series 
of subheadings concerned. 
 
2.-  Note 3 to Chapter 29 does not apply to the subheadings of this Chapter.

PLASTICS AND ARTICLES THEREOF; 
RUBBER AND ARTICLES THEREOF 
 
Notes. 
 
1.-   Goods put up in sets con sisting of two or more separate constituents, some or all of which fall in this Section and 
 are intended to be mixed together to obtain a product of Section VI or VII, are to be classified in the heading 
 appropriate to that product, provided that the constituents are : 
 
  (a)  having regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to 
  be used together without first being repacked; 
  (b)  presented together; and 
  (c)  identifiable, whether by their nature or by the r elative proportions in which they are present, as 
  being complementary one to another. 
 
2.-  Except for the goods of heading 39.18 or 39.19, plastics, rubber, and articles thereof, printed with motifs, characters 
or pictorial representations, which are not merely subsidiary to the primary use of the goods, fall in Chapter 49. 
 
 
Chapter 39 
 
Plastics and articles thereof 
Notes. 
 
1.-   Throughout the Nomenclature the expression “plastics” means those materials of headings 39.01 to 39.14 which 
 are or have bee n capable, either at the moment of polymerisation or at some subsequent stage, of being formed 
 under external influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser) by moulding, casting, 
 extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the removal of the external influence. 
 
 Throughout the Nomenclature any reference to “plastics” also includes vulcanised fibre. The expression, however, 
 does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI. 
 
2.-  This Chapter does not cover : 
  (a)  Lubricating preparations of heading 27.10 or 34.03; 
  (b)  Waxes of heading 27.12 or 34.04;

  purposes as mineral oils (heading 38.11); 
  (ij)  Prepared hydraulic fluids based on polyglycols, silicones or other polymers of Chapter 39 
  (heading 38.19); 
  (k)  Diagnostic or laboratory reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 38.22); 
  (l)  Synthetic rubber, as defined for the purposes of Chapter 40, or articles thereof;

  stems for smoking pipes, cigarette-holders or the like, parts  of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, 
  propelling pencils, and monopods, bipods, tripods and similar articles). 
 
3.-   Headings 39.01 to 39.11 apply only to goods of a kind produced by chemical synthesis, falling in the following 
 categories : 
 
   (a)  Liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 % by volume distils at 300 °C, after  
   conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced -pressure distillation method is used (headings 
   39.01 and 39.02); 
   (b)  Resins, not highly polymerised, of the coumarone-indene type (heading 39.11); 
   (c)  Other synthetic polymers with an average of at least 5 monomer units; 
   (d)  Silicones (heading 39.10); 
   (e)  Resols (heading 39.09) and other prepolymers. 
 
4.-   The expression “copolymers” covers all polymers in  which no single monomer unit contributes 95 % or more by 
 weight to the total polymer content. 
 
 For the purposes of this Chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including 
 copolycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copol ymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to 
 be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over every 
 other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this Note, constituent comonomer units of  polymers falling in 
 the same heading shall be taken together. 
 
 If no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified 
 in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 
 
5.-   Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been 
 changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This 
 provision does not apply to graft copolymers. 
 
6.-   In headings 39.01 to 39.14, the expression “primary forms” applies only to the following forms : 
 
  (a)  Liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions; 
  (b)  Blocks of irreg ular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar 
  bulk forms. 
 
7.-   Heading 39.15 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into 
 primary forms (headings 39.01 to 39.14). 
 
8.-   For the purposes of heading 39.17, the expression “tubes, pipes and hoses” means hollow products, whether semi -
 manufactures or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or 

<!-- page 285 -->

285A 
 liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and 
 other lay -flat tubing. However, except for the last -mentioned, those having an internal cross -section other than 
 round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does n ot exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular 
 polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes. 
 
9.-   For the purposes of heading 39.18, the expression “wall or ceiling coverings of plastics” applies to product s in 
 rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed 
 permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, 
 embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated. 
 
10.-   In headings 39.20 and 39.21, the expression “plates, sheets, film, foil and strip” applies only to plates, sheets, film, 
 foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, w hether or not printed or 
 otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so 
 cut they become articles ready for use). 
 
11.-   Heading 39.25 applies only to the following articles, not being p roducts covered by any of the earlier headings of 
 sub-Chapter II : 
  (a)  Reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 
  300 l; 
  (b)  Structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs; 
  (c) Gutters and fittings therefor; 
  (d)  Doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors; 
  (e)  Balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers; 
  (f)  Shutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and and parts and fittings  
  thereof; 
  (g)  Large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops,  
  workshops, warehouses; 
  (h)  Ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and 
  (ij)  Fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, 
  walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, 
  switchplates and other protective plates.

Subheading Notes. 
 
1.-  Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are 
 to be classified according to the following provisions : 
 
  (a)  Where there is a subheading named “Other” in the same series : 
   (1)  The designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix “poly” (for example, 
   polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or  
   monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95 % or more 
   by weight of the total polymer content. 
(2)  The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3901.40,  3903.20, 3903.30 and 
3904.30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units 
of the named copolymers contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer 
content. 
   (3)  Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named “Other”, 
   provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by 
   another subheading. 
   (4)  Polymers not meet ing (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, 
   among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer 
   unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this 
   purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall 
   be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the 
   series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared. 
 
  (b)  Where there is no subheading named “Other” in the same series : 
 
   (1)  Polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer 
   unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this 
   purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall 
   be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the 
   series under consideration are to be compared.

   (2)  Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropr iate to 
   the unmodified polymer.  
 
Polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same 
proportions. 
 
2.- For the purposes of subheading 3920.43, the term “plasticisers” includes secondary plasticisers.

308A 
  (f)  Articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens and mitts and articles of headings 
  40.11 to 40.13). 
 
3.-   In headings 40.01 to 40.03 and 40.05, the expression “primary forms” applies only to the following forms : 
 
  (a)  Liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre -vulcanised, and other dispersions and 
  solutions); 
  (b)  Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms. 
 
4.-   In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the expression “synthetic rubber” applies to : 
   (a)  Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with 
   sulphur into non -thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18 °C and 29 °C, 
   will not break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after being 
   extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater 
   than one and a half times their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances  
   necessary for the cross -linking, such as vulcanising activators or accelerators, may be added; 
   the presence of substances as provided for by Note 5 (B) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted.  
   However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as  
   extenders, plasticisers and fillers, is not permitted; 
   (b)  Thioplasts (TM); and 
   (c)  Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, 
   mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided 
   that all the above-mentioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation, 
   elongation and recovery in (a) above. 
 
5.-   (A)  Headings 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, 
  before or after coagulation, with : 
 
  (i)  vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the  
  preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex); 
  (ii)  pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of  
  identification; 
  (iii)  plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers,  
  reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other substances, except those permitted under (B); 
 
 (B)  The presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its  
  classification in heading 40.01 or 40.02, as the case may be, provided that s uch rubber or mixture of 
  rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material : 
 
  (i)  emulsifiers or anti-tack agents; 
  (ii)  small amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers; 
  (iii)  very small amounts of the following : heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining  
  thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining  
  electropositive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze -resisting 
  agents, peptisers, preservatives, stabi lisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special -purpose 
  additives. 
 
6.-   For the purposes of heading 40.04, the expression “waste, parings and scrap” means rubber waste, parings and 
 scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of 
 cutting-up, wear or other reasons. 
 
7.-   Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross -sectional dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as 
 strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading 40.08.  
 
8.-   Heading 40.10 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or 
 laminated with rubber or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber. 
 
9.-   In headings 40.01, 40.02,  40.03, 40.05 and 40.08, the expressions “plates”, “sheets” and “strip” apply only to 
 plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including 
 square) shape, whether or not having the character of a rticles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface -
 worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked. 
 
 In heading 40.08 the expressions “rods” and “profile shapes” apply only to such products, whether or not cut to 
 length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.

  (whether or not in the mass) or printed; or 
 (ii)  is of indeterminate colour (“grey yarn”), manufactured from garnetted stock. 
   
Such yarn may have been treated with a colourless dressing or fugitive dye (which disappears after simple washing 
with soap) and, in the case of man -made fibres, treated  in the mass with delustring agents (for example, titanium 
dioxide). 
(b)  Bleached yarn 
 Yarn which : 
 (i)  has undergone a bleaching process, is made of bleached fibres or, unless the context 
  otherwise requires, has been dyed white (whether or not in th e mass) or treated with 
  a white dressing; 
 (ii)  consists of a mixture of unbleached and bleached fibres; or 
 (iii)  is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached and bleached yarns. 
(c)  Coloured (dyed or printed) yarn

 (i)  is dyed (whether or not in the mass) other than white or in a fugitive colour, or  
  printed, or made from dyed or printed fibres; 
 (ii)  consists of a mixture of dyed fibres of different colours or of a mixture of  
  unbleached or bleached fibres with colou red fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or is 
  printed in one or more colours at intervals to give the impression of dots; 
 (iii) is obtained from slivers or rovings which have been printed; or 
 (iv)  is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and  
  coloured yarn. 
The above definitions also apply, mutatis mutandis, to monofilament  and to strip or the like of Chapter 
54. 
 
 
(d)  Unbleached woven fabric 
 Woven fabric made from unbleached yarn and which has not been bleached, dyed  or 
 printed.Such fabric may have been treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive dye.

PART I : SEC (I) - GAZETTE EXTRA ORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST RE PUBLIC OF SRI LANKA –  24.03.2023 
 
 
 
375A 
 Woven fabric which : 
 (i)  has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise requires, dyed white or treated 
  with a white dressing, in the piece; 
 (ii)  consists of bleached yarn; or 
 (iii)  consists of unbleached and bleached yarn. 
(f)  Dyed woven fabric 
 Woven fabric which : 
 (i)  is dyed a single uniform colour other than white (unless the context otherwise

  context otherwise requires), in the piece; or 
 (ii)  consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour. 
(g)  Woven fabric of yarns of different colours 
 Woven fabric (other than printed woven fabric) which : 
 (i)  consists of yarns of different colours or yarns of different shades of the same colour

  (In all cases, the yarn used in selvedges and piece ends is not taken into  
   consideration.) 
 
 
 
(h)  Printed woven fabric 
 Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether or not made from yarns of different 
 colours. 
 (The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics : woven fabrics bearing designs 
 made, for example, with a brush or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by 
 the batik process.) 
 
The process of mercerisation does not affect th e classification of yarns or fabrics within the above 
categories. 
 
The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, mutatis mutandis, to knitted or crocheted fabrics. 
 
(ij)  Plain weave 
 A fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately ove r and under 
 successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternately over and under 
 successive yarns of the weft. 
 
2.-  (A)  Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting 
  wholly of that textile material which would be selected under Note 2 to this Section for the  
  classification of a product of  Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 58.09 consisting of the same textile  
  materials. 
 
 
 
 (B)  For the application of this rule : 
 (a)  where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under Interpretative Rule 
  3 shall be taken into account; 
 (b)  in the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface no 
  account shall be taken of the ground fabric; 
 (c)  in the case of embroidery of heading 58.10 and goods thereof, only the ground fabric shall be 
  taken into account. However, embroidery without visible ground, and goods thereof, shall be 
  classified with reference to the embroidering threads alone.

Chapter 54 
 
Man-made filaments; strip and the like of man-made textile materials 
 
Notes. 
 
1.-  Throughout the Nomenclature, the term “man-made fibres” means staple fibres and filaments  
      of organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either : 
 
 (a)   By polymerisation of organic monomers to produce polymers such as polyami des, polyesters, 
  polyolefins or polyurethanes, or by chemical modification of polymers produced by this  
  process (for example, poly(vinyl alcohol) prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate)); or 
 
 (b)   By dissolution or chemical treatment of na tural organic polymers (for example, cellulose) to 
  produce polymers such as cuprammonium rayon (cupro) or viscose rayon, or by chemical 
  modification of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose, casein and other proteins, or 
  alginic acid), to produce polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates. 
 
 The terms “synthetic” and “artificial”, used in relation to fibres, mean : synthetic : fibres as defined at (a); artificial 
 : fibres as defined at (b). Strip and the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05 are not considered to be man-made fibres. 
 
 The terms “man-made”, “synthetic” and “artificial” shall have the same meanings when used in relation to “textile 
 materials”. 
 
2.-  Headings 54.02 and 54.03 do not apply to synthetic or artificial filament tow of Chapter 55.

Chapter 56 
 
Wadding, felt and nonwovens; special yarns; 
twine, cordage, ropes and cables and articles thereof 
 
Notes. 
 
1.-  This Chapter does not cover : 
 
 (a)  Wadding, felt or nonwovens, impregnated, coated or covered with substances or preparations 
 (for example, perfumes or cosmetics of Chapter 33, soaps or detergents of heading 34.01, 
 polishes, creams or  similar preparations of heading 34.05, fabric softeners of heading 38.09) 
 where the textile material is  present merely as a carrying medium; 
 (b)  Textile products of heading 58.11; 
  (c)  Natural or artificial abrasive powder or grain, on  a backing of felt or nonwovens (heading 
  68.05); 
  (d)  Agglomerated or reconstituted mica, on a backing of felt or nonwovens (heading 68.14); 
 (e)  Metal foil on a backing of felt or nonwovens (generally Section XIV or XV); or 
(f)  Sanitary towels (pads) and tampons, napkins (diapers) and napkin liners and similar articles of 
heading 96.19. 
2.-   The term “felt” includes needleloom felt and fabrics consisting of a web of textile fibres the cohesion of which has 
 been enhanced by a stitch-bonding process using fibres from the web itself. 
 
3.-   Headings 56.02 and 56.03 cover respectively felt and nonwovens, impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with 
 plastics or rubber whatever the nature of these materials (compact or cellular). 
 Heading 56.03 also includes nonwovens in which plastics or rubber forms the bonding substance. 
 Headings 56.02 and 56.03 do not, however, cover : 
 
  (a)  Felt impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or rubber, containing 50 % or less 
  by weight of textile mate rial or felt completely embedded in plastics or rubber (Chapter 39 or 
  40); 
  (b)  Nonwovens, either completely embedded in plastics or rubber, or entirely coated or covered on 
  both sides with such materials, provided that such coating or covering can b e seen with the 
  naked eye with no account being taken of any resulting change of colour (Chapter 39 or 40); or 
  (c)  Plates, sheets or strip of cellular plastics or cellular rubber combined with felt or nonwovens, 
  where the textile material is present merely for reinforcing purposes (Chapter 39 or 40). 
 
4.-   Heading 56.04 does not cover textile yarn, or strip or the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05, in which the 
 impregnation, coating or covering cannot be seen with the naked eye (usually Chapters 50 to  55); for the purpose 
 of this provision, no account should be taken of any resulting change of colour.

   of their outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising : 
 
   - one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more 
   panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in

 outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising : 
 
 - one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels,

 - one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts 
 (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.

 must also be of the same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may 
 have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric. 
 
 If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, 
 two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower 
 part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' s uits, the skirt or divided skirt, the 
 other garments being considered separately. 
 
 The term “suit” includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above 
 conditions : 
 
 
 - morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) wit h rounded tails hanging well down at the back 
 and striped trousers;

 (b)  The term “ensemble” means a set of garments (other th an suits and articles of heading 62.07 or 62.08) 
 composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising : 
 
 - one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of waistcoats which may 
 also form a second upper garment, and 
 
 - one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, 
 bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt. 
 
  All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and  
  composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term “ensemble” does not

Section XV 
 
BASE METALS AND ARTICLES OF BASE METAL 
 
Notes. 
 
1.-  This Section does not cover : 
   (a)  Prepared paints, inks or oth er products with a basis of metallic flakes or powder (headings 
   32.07 to 32.10, 32.12, 32.13 or 32.15); 
   (b) Ferro-cerium or other pyrophoric alloys (heading 36.06); 
   (c)  Headgear or parts thereof of heading 65.06 or 65.07; 
   (d)  Umbrella frames or other articles of heading 66.03; 
   (e)  Goods of Chapter 71 (for example, precious metal alloys, base metal clad with precious metal, 
   imitation jewellery); 
   (f)  Articles of Section XVI (machinery, mechanical appliances and electrical goods); 
   (g)  Assembled railway or tramway track (heading 86.08) or other articles of Section XVII  
   (vehicles, ships and boats, aircraft); 
   (h)  Instruments or apparatus of Section XVIII, including clock or watch springs; 
   (ij)  Lead shot prepared for ammunition (heading 93.06) or other articles of Section XIX (arms and 
   ammunition); 
(k)  Articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, mattress supports, luminaires and lighting  
fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings); 
   (l)  Articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); 
   (m)  Hand sieves, buttons, pens, pencil -holders, pen nibs, monopods, bipods, tripods and similar                           
     articles or other articles of Chapter 96 (miscellaneous manufactured articles); or 
   (n)  Articles of Chapter 97 (for example, works of art). 
 
2.-  Throughout the Nomenclature, the expression “parts of general use” means : 
 
 
(a)  Articles of heading 73.07, 73.12, 73.15, 73.17 or 73.18 and similar articles of other base metal, 
other than articles specially designed for use exclusively in implants in medical, surgical, 
dental or veterinary sciences (heading 90.21); 
   (b)  Springs and leaves for springs, of base metal, other than clock or watch springs (heading  
   91.14); and 
   (c)  Articles of headings 83.01, 83.02, 83.08, 83.10 and frames and mirrors, of base metal, of 
    heading 83.06. 
 
 In Chapters 73 to 76 and 78 to 82 (but not in heading 73.15) references to parts of goods do not include references 
 to parts of general use as defined above. 
 
 Subject to the preceding paragraph and to Note 1 to Chapter 83, the articles of Chapter 82 or 83 are excluded from 
 Chapters 72 to 76 and 78 to 81.

522A 
 
3.-   Throughout the Nomenclature, the expression “base metals” means : iron and ste el, copper, nickel, aluminium, 
 lead, zinc, tin, tungsten (wolfram), molybdenum, tantalum, magnesium, cobalt, bismuth, cadmium, titanium, 
 zirconium, antimony, manganese, beryllium, chromium, germanium, vanadium, gallium, hafnium, indium, 
 niobium (columbium), rhenium and thallium. 
 
4.-   Throughout the Nomenclature, the term “cermets” means products containing a microscopic heterogeneous 
 combination of a metallic component and a ceramic component. The term “cermets” includes sintered metal 
 carbides (metal carbides sintered with a metal). 
 
5.-  Classification of alloys (other than ferro-alloys and master alloys as defined in Chapters 72 and 74) : 
 
   (a)  An alloy of base metals is to be classified as an alloy of the metal which predominates by  
   weight over each of the other metals; 
   (b)  An alloy composed of base metals of this Section and of elements not falling within this  
   Section is to be treated as an alloy of base metals of this Section if the total weight of such 
   metals equals or exceeds the total weight of the other elements present; 
   (c)  In this Section the term “alloys” includes sintered mixtures of metal powders, heterogeneous 
   intimate mixtures obtained by melting (other than cermets) and intermetallic compounds. 
 
6.-   Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference in the Nomenclature to a base metal includes a reference to 
 alloys which, by virtue of Note 5 above, are to be classified as alloys of that metal. 
 
7.-  Classification of composite articles : 
 
Except where the headings otherwise require, articles of base metal (including articles of mixed materials treated as 
articles of base metal under the General Interpretative Rules) containing two or more base metals are to be treated 
as articles of the base metal predominating by weight over each of the other metals. 
 
 For this purpose : 
 
   (a)  Iron and steel, or different kinds of iron or steel, are regarded as one and the same metal; 
   (b)  An alloy is regarded as being entirely composed of that metal as an alloy of which, by virtue of 
   Note 5, it is classified; and 
   (c) A cermet of heading 81.13 is regarded as a single base metal. 
 
8.-  In this Section, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : 
 
(a) Waste and scrap 
 (i) All metal waste and scrap; 
(ii) Metal goods definitely not usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons. 
 
(b) Powders 
  Products of which 90 % or more by weight passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1 mm. 
 
 
9.- For the purposes of Chapters 74 to 76 and 78 to 81, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : 
 
(a) Bars and rods 
Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in 
the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including “flattened 
circles” and “modified rectangles”, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two  sides being straight, of equal 
length and pa rallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal  cross-section may have corners 
rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including “modified rectangular”) 
cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and 
dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple tr imming or de -scaling), 
provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. 
 
Wire-bars and billets of Chapter 74 with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines 
for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of 
heading 74.03. This provision applies mutatis mutandis to the products of Chapter 81.

cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple 
trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. 
 
(c) Wire 
 
Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross -section along their whole length in the shape 
of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including “flattened circles” 
and “modified rectangles”, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and 
parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along 
their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including “modified rectangular”) cross-section 
exceeds one-tenth of the width. 
 
(d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil 
 
Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading 80.01), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than 
square) cross-section with or without rounded corners (including “modified rectangles” of which two opposite sides are convex 
arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are : 
- of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width; 
- of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles  
or products of other headings. 
 
Headings for plates, sheets, strip, and foil apply, inter alia, to plates, sheets, strip, and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, 
ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, 
provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings. 
 
(e) Tubes and pipes 
 
Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross -section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in 
the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a 
uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular  convex polygonal 
cross-section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided 
the inner and outer cross -sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes  of the foregoing 
cross -sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars 
or rings.

526A 
 
 (c)  Silicon-electrical steel 
  Alloy steels containing by weight at least 0.6 % but not more than 6 % of silicon and not more than 0.08 
  % of carbon. They may also contain by weight not more than 1 % of aluminium but no other element in 
  a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel. 
 
 (d)  High speed steel 
  Alloy steels containing, with or without other elements, at least two of the three elements 
  molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium with a combined content by weight of 7 % or more, 0.6 % or more 
  of carbon and 3 to 6 % of chromium. 
 
 (e)  Silico-manganese steel 
  Alloy steels containing by weight : 
  - not more than 0.7 % of carbon, 
  - 0.5 % or more but not more than 1.9 % of manganese, and 
  - 0.6 % or more but not more than 2.3 % of silicon, but no o ther element in a proportion that would give 
  the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel. 
 
2.-   For the classification of ferro-alloys in the subheadings of heading 72.02 the following rule should be observed : 
 
 A ferro-alloy is considered as binary and classified under the relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the 
 alloy elements exceeds the minimum percentage laid down in Chapter Note 1 (c); by analogy, it is considered 
 respectively as ternary or quaternary if two or three alloy elements exceed the minimum percentage. 
 
 For the application of this rule the unspecified “other elements” referred to in Chapter Note 1 (c) must each exceed 
 10 % by weight.

Copper and articles thereof 
Note. 
 
1.-  In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : 
 
   (a)  Refined copper 
 
   Metal containing at least 99.85 % by weight of copper; or 
 
   Metal containing at least 97.5 % by weight of copper, provided that the content by weight of 
   any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table : 
 
TABLE - Other elements 
 
Element Limiting content % 
by weight 
Ag               Silver 0.25 
As               Arsenic 0.5 
Cd               Cadmium 1.3 
Cr                Chromium 1.4 
Mg              Magnesium 0.8 
Pb               Lead 1.5 
S                 Sulphur 0.7 
Sn               Tin 0.8 
Te               Tellurium 0.8 
Zn               Zinc 1.0 
Zr                Zirconium 0.3 
Other elements*, each 0.3 
 
  * Other elements are, for example, Al, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Si. 
 
  (b)  Copper alloys 
    Metallic substances other than unrefined copper in which copper predominates by weight over 
   each of the other elements, provided that : 
     (i)  the content by w eight of at least one of the other elements is greater than 
     the limit specified in the foregoing table; or 
     (ii)  the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5 %. 
 
   (c)  Master alloys 
   Alloys containing with other elements more than 10 % by weight of copper, not usefully  
   malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de- 
   oxidants, desulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of non -ferrous metals. 
   However,  copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15 % by weight of  
   phosphorus falls in heading 28.53.

Subheading Note. 
 
1.  In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : 
 
   (a)  Copper-zinc base alloys (brasses) 
   Alloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present : 
   - zinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements; 
   - any nickel content by weight is less than 5 % (see copper -nickel-zinc alloys (nickel silvers)); 
   and 
   - any tin content by weight is less than 3 % (see copper-tin alloys (bronzes)). 
   (b)  Copper-tin base alloys (bronzes) 
   Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin 
   predominates by weight over each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3 
   % or more the zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10 %. 
   (c)  Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers) 
   Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel content is 5 % or 
   more by weight (see copper-zinc alloys (brasses)). 
   (d)  Copper-nickel base alloys  
   Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case containing by 
   weight not more than 1 % of zinc. When other elements are present, nickel predominates by 
   weight over each of such other elements.

Chapter 88 
 
Aircraft, spacecraft, and parts thereof 
Note. 
1. - For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression “unmanned aircraft” means any aircraft, other than those of 
heading 88.01, designed to be flown without a pilot on board. They may be designed to carry a payload or 
equipped with permanently integrated digital cameras or other equipment which would enable them to perform 
utilitarian functions during their flight.  
The expression “unmanned aircraft”, however, does not cover flying toys, designed solely for amusement purposes 
(heading 95.03).   
 
Subheading Notes. 
 
1.-  For the purposes of subheadings 8802.11 to 8802.40, the expression “unladen weight” means the weight of the 
 machine in normal flying order, excluding the weight of the crew and of fuel and equipment other than 
 permanently fitted items of equipment 
 
2.  For the purposes of subheadings 8806.21 to 8806.24 and 8806.91 to 8806.94, the expression "maximum take-off 
weight" means the maximum weight of the machine in normal flying order, at take-off, including the weight of 
payload, equipment and fuel.

  (f)  Ball bearings (heading 84.82); or 
  (g)  Articles of Chapter 85, not yet assembled together or with other components into watch or 
  clock movements or into articles suitable for use solely or principally as parts of such  
  movements (Chapter 85). 
 
2.-   Heading 91.01 covers only watches with case wholly of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal, or of 
 the same materials combined with natural or cultured pearls, or precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic 
 or reconstructed) of headings 71.01 to 71.04. Watches with case of base metal inlaid with precious metal fall in 
 heading 91.02. 
 
3.-  For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression “watch movements” means devices regulated by a balance -wheel 
and hairspring, quartz crystal or any other system capable of determining intervals of time, with a display or a system 
to which a mechanical display can be incorporated. Such watch movements shall not exceed 12 mm in thickness and 
50 mm in width, length or diameter. 
 
4.-   Except as provided in Note 1, movements and other parts suitable for use both in clocks or watches and in other 
 articles (for example, precision instruments) are to be classified in this Chapter.
