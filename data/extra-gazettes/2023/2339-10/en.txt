 a   the primary values to be used are given in tBq, Curie values are provided for practical usefulness and are rounded 
after conversion.
 b   Criticality and safeguards issues will need to be considered for multiples of d.
 *   these radionuclides are very unlikely to be used in individual radioactive sources with activity levels that would place 
them within Categories 1, 2 or 3 
Note : d values of radionuclides which are not given in this annex is decided by the Council as and when such data is 
required.

aggregation of sources
there will be situations in which several radioactive sources are in close proximity, such as in manufacturing processes 
(e. g. in the same room or building) or in storage facilities (e. g. in the same enclosure). in such circumstances, if only one 
radionuclide is present the summed activity of the radioactive sources shall be divided by the appropriate d value of the 
radionuclide and the calculated ratio a/d compared with the ratios a/d given in table ii to determine the corresponding 
security level, if radioactive sources with various radionuclides are present and to be aggregated, then the sum of the ratios 
a/d shall be used in determining the category, in accordance with  the formula :
aggregate a/d =
Where :
a
i,n = activity of each individual source i of radionuclide n. 
dn = d value for radionuclide n.

exaMPles   oF   CoNteNt   FoR   a   seCuRity   PlaN
a security plan shall include all information necessary to describe the security approach and system being used for protection 
of the sources (s). the level of detail and depth of content shall be commensurate with the security level of the source(s) 
covered by the plan. the following topics shall typically be included :
 (a) a description of the source, its categorization, and its use ;
 (b) a description of the environment, building and/or facility where the sources is used or stored, and it appropriate a 
diagram of the facility layout and security system ;
 (c) the location of the building or facility relative to areas accessible to the public ;
 (d) local security procedures ;
 (e) the objectives of the security plan for the specific building or facility, including :-
 (i) the specific concern to be addressed ; unauthorized removal, destruction, or malevolent use ;
 (ii) the kind of control needed to prevent undesired consequences including the auxiliary equipment that might 
be needed ; and
 (iii) the equipment or premises that will be secured.
 (f) the security measures to be used, including :-
 (i) the measures to secure, provide surveillance, provide access control, detect, delay, respond and communicate 
; and
 (ii) the design features to evaluate the quality of the measures against the assumed threat ;
 (g) the administrative measures to be used, including :-
 (i) the security roles and responsibilities of management, staff and others ;
