Observations and Findings.
Road development Authority is a statutory body and terms conditions of its staﬀ  are governed by legislative provisions under 
Shop and Oﬃ  ce Employees Act, Wages Boards Ordinance, Employees Provident  Fund Act, Employees Trust Fund Act, 
Payments of Gratuity Act and Industrial Disputes Act.
Being a statutory entity, its ﬁ nancial administration comes under the control and guidance of Management Services Department, 
under Ministry of Finance, with decide on cadre position, In determining cadre requirements such need are carefully analyzed 
and decisions taken, dependent on government policy concerning projects, At times ad-hoc recruitments are made  and 
manpower taken in on temporary contracts subject to permanency in the event of vacancies that surface within the approved 
cadre. Once staﬀ  on temporary contracts has been made permanent, it's not the policy to grant permanency with retrospective 
eﬀ ect.
However in evidence it came to light that the applicants in question have employed and most of the beneﬁ ts granted to permanent  
hands except the vehicle permit.Iam of the opinion that this class of employees deserve grant of such permit as they need to run 
about in diﬀ erent terrain, day and night, as engineers.
AWARD
I have analyzed evidence comprehensively and feel that no change is necessary at the present movement considering the state 
policy adopted hitherto.
This is Just and a Fair Award
