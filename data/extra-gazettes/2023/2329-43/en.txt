THE 2023 PROHIBITED LIST  
WORLD ANTI-DOPING CODE 
VALID 01 JANUARY 2023
Introduction 
the prohibited list is a mandatory international standard as part of the World anti-doping program. 
The List is updated annually following an extensive consultation process facilitated by WADA. The eff
ective date of the List 
is 01 January 2023. 
The official text of the Prohibited List shall be maintained by WADA and shall be published in English and French. In the 
event of any conflict between the English and French versions, the English version shall prevail.
Below are some terms used in this list of prohibited substances and prohibited Methods.
Prohibited In-Competition 
Subject to a different period having been approved by WADA for a given sport, the In - Competition period shall in principle 
be the period commencing just before midnight (at 11:59 p.m.) on the day before a Competition in which the athlete is 
scheduled to participate until the end of the Competition and the sample collection process.
Prohibited at all times 
This means that the substance or method is prohibited In- and Out-of-Competition as defined in the Code. 
Specified and non-Specified 
as per article 4.2.2 of the World anti-doping Code, “for purposes of the application of article 10, all prohibited substances 
shall be Specified Substances except as identified on the Prohibited List. No Prohibited Method shall be a Specified Method 
unless it is specifically identified as a Specified Met hod on the Pro hibited List”. As per the  comment to the art icle, “the 
Specified Substances and Methods identified in Article 4.2.2 should not in any wa y be considered less important or less 
dangerous than other doping substances or methods. rather, 
they are simply substances and methods which are more likely 
to have been consumed or used by an Athlete for a purpose other than the enhancement of sport performance.” 
Substances of Abuse 
Pursuant to Article 4.2.3 of the Code, Substances of Abuse are substances that are identified a s s uch because t hey are 
frequently abused in society outside of the context of sport. The following are designated Substances of Abuse: cocaine, 
diamorphine (heroin), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA “ecstasy”), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
