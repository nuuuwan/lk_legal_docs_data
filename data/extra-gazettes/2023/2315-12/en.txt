Local  Authorities Elections  Ordinance  (Chapter 262)
Order Under Section 76A
BY virtue of the powers vested in the Election Commission under Section 76A of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance 
(Chapter 262), it is hereby notiﬁ ed that the Election Commission will disregard paragraph (a) of Sub-section (3) of Section 
31 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance which reads as "where the candidate or person concerned is a youth, to have 
attached to the nomination paper a certi ﬁ ed copy of his Certi ﬁ cate of Birth or in the event, the Certi ﬁ cate of Birth is not 
available an afﬁ davit signed by such youth certifying his date of birth;" since this paragraph was in effect when the youth 
representation was a mandatory requirement under the provisions prevailed which was repealed by the Local Authorities 
Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2017.
