SCHEDULE  - 3
Incentive Payments.–
 1.  The incentive scheme applicable to Brush Filling Machine O perators (BFMO) will commence at 70% eﬃ  ciency 
level of each machine capacity (based on the cycle time of the respective machine). The amounts payable at 
70%, 75%, 80%, 85% 91%, and 101% are set out in the attachment. The output that has to be achieved in order 
to receive incentive payments on short working days are also set out in the attachment.
 2.  No incentive payments will be made to BFMO for eﬃ   ciency levels below 70%.
 3.  Only marketable quality output with zero defects will be c onsidered for calculations of incentives as described 
in (1) and (2) above. Damaged or items that need to be re-worked will not be considered for same.
  The incentive payable for a shift to a BFMO would be calculat ed by multiplying the marketable quality brushes* 
rate (at each eﬃ  ciency level).
 4. Machine breakdown time will be considered as operating time  for the purpose of calculating incentives.
 5. In the event a machine could not be operated for the entire  eight hour shift due to non-availability of brush 
blocks or ﬁ lling material, the incentive payable would be calculated as follows:
 ( a) The machine should have been operated for a minimum of ﬁ ve hours during the shift.
 ( b) The output obtained during the hours that the machine was operated would be pro-rated to compute the 
incentive.
 6. The incentive scheme applicable to Mechanics and Electricia ns is as follows:
  They would be entitled to a maximum of 80% of the average inc entive earned by BFMO during the respective 
month subject to the following criteria:
I. If Engineering availability index is below 80%: No Incentive
II. If Engineering availability index is between 80% and 
84.99%
50% of average incentive earned by BFMO will be paid to 
Skilled employees
75% of the amount payable to Skilled employees would be 
received by semi-skilled employees                                           
and
60% of the amount payable to Skilled employees would be 
received by Unskilled employees
III. If Engineering availability index is between 85% and 
89.99%
60% of average incentive earned by BFMO would be
