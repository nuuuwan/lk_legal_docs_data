SLFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRSs) 
39AG Annual Improvements to SLFRS Standards 2020 , issued in February 2022 , amended 
paragraph D1(f) and added paragraph D13A. An entity shall apply  that amendment for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is 
permitted. If an entity applies the amendment for an earlier pe riod, it shall disclose that 
fact.

D1 An entity may elect to use one or more of the following exemptions: 
(f) cumulative translation differences (paragraphs D12‚ÄìD13A); 
D13A Instead of applying paragraph D12 or paragraph D13, a subsidiary that uses the exemption 
in paragraph D16(a) may elect, in its financial statements, to measure cumulative 
translation differences for all foreign operations at the carry ing amount that would be 
included in the parent‚Äôs consolidated financial statements, bas ed on the parent‚Äôs date of 
transition to SLFRSs, if no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures and for 
the effects of the business combination in which the parent acq uired the subsidiary. A 
similar election is available to an associate or joint venture that uses the exemption in 
paragraph D16(a).

applying the requirements in paragraphs 21A‚Äì31, which will result in some items being:

Paragraph 
Reference 
Paragraph 
21A Liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of LKAS 37 or IFRIC 21
Paragraph 21B applies to liab ilities and contingent liabilities  that would be within the 
scope of LKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 
Levies if they were incurred separately rather than assumed in a business combination.
21B The Conceptual Framework fo r Financial Reporting defines a liability as ‚Äòa present 
obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events‚Äô. For a 
provision or contingent liability that would be within the scop e of LKAS 37, the acquirer 
shall apply paragraphs 15 ‚Äì22 of LKAS 37to determine whether at the acquisition date a 
present obligation exists as a result of past events. For a lev y that would be within the 
scope of IFRIC 21, the acquirer shall apply IFRIC 21 to determine whether the obligating 
event that gives rise to a liability to pay the levy has occurred by the acquisition date.
21C A present obligation identified in accordance with paragraph 21 B might meet the 
definition of a contingent liability set out in paragraph 22(b) . If so, paragraph 23 applies 
to that contingent liability.
22 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
LKAS 37 defines a contingent liability as: 
(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose  existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non‚Äëoccurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or ( b)apresentobligation
that arises from past events but is not recognised because:(i) it is notprobable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will b erequired to 
settle the obligation; or (ii) the amount of the obligation can not be measured
with sufficient reliability.
23 The acquirer shall recognise as of the acquisition date a contingent liability assumed in a 
business combination if it is a present obligation that arises from past events and its fair 
value can be measured reliably. Therefore, contrary to paragraphs 14(b), 23, 27, 29 and 30 
of LKAS 37, the acquirer recognises a contingent liability assu med in a business 
combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Paragraph 56 of this 
SLFRS provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for contingent liabilities.
23A LKAS 37 defines acontingent asset as ‚Äòa possible asset that arises from past eve nts and 
whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non -occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity‚Äô. The acquirer shall 
not recognise a contingent asset at the acquisition date.

The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that rela te directly to the contract. 
Costs that relate directly to a contract consist of both: 
(a) the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract ‚Äîfor example, direct labour and 
materials; and 
(b) an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfillin g contracts‚Äîfor example, 
an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of propert y, pla nt and 
equipment used in fulfilling that contract among others. 
69 Before a separate provision for an onerous contract is established, an entity recognises any 
impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract (see LKAS 36).  
94A Onerous Contracts‚ÄîCost of Fulfilling a Contract , issued in May 2020, added paragraph 
68A and amended paragraph 69. An entity shall apply those amend ments to contracts for 
which it has not yet fulfilled all its obligations at the begin ning of the annual  reporting 
period in which it first applies the amendments (the date of initial application). The entity 
shall not restate comparative information. Instead, the entity shall recognise the cumulative 
effect of initially applying the amendments as an adjustment to  the opening balance of 
retained earnings or other component of equity, as appropriate,  at the date of initial 
application. 
105 Onerous Contracts ‚ÄîCost of Fulfilling a Contract , issued in February 2021 , added 
paragraphs 68A and 94A and amended paragraph 69. An entity shal l apply those

When an entity applies paragraph 102P to groups of items designated as hedged items in 
a fair value or cash flow hedge, the entity shall allocate the hedged items to subgroups 
based on the benchmark rate being hedged and designate the benchmark rate as the hedged 
risk for each subgroup. For example, in a hedging relationship in which a group of items 
is hedged for changes in an interest rate benchmark subject to interest rate benchmark 
reform, the hedged cash flows or fair value of some items in th e group could be changed

to reference an alternative benchmark rate before other items in the group are changed. In 
this example, in applying paragraph 102P, the entity would desi gnate the alternative 
benchmark rate as the hedged risk for that relevant subgroup of  hedged items. The entity 
would continue to designate the existing interest rate benchmark as the hedged risk for the 
other subgroup of hedged items until the hedged cash flows or fair value of those items are 
changed to reference the alternative benchmark rate or the item s expire and are replaced 
with hedged items that reference the alternative benchmark rate.

shall be included in the initial measurement.

biological assets after harvest (for example, the cost of repla nting trees in a plantation 
forest after harvest).
65 Annual Improvements to SLFRS Standards 2020 , issued in February 2022 , amended 
paragraph 22. An entity shall apply that amendment to fair value measurements on or after 
the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on  or after 1 January 2022. 
Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendment for an earlier period, it 
shall disclose that fact.
