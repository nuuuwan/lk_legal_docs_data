The witness further said in the advertisement 04/P/04 there was no mention of Executive or Non Executive.
The witness further said other than 7 Applicants there are 4 Training  oﬃ  cers who  falls into Executive Category.
The witness further admitted that main issue to be solve  that cancellation of appointment dated 26.03.2018 on 24.07.2018.
Cancellation was done without giving any  reasons. In the lette r the Applicants were placed on JLM post, the Applicants 
have  decided  not to take increased salary for the period 2013 to 2018.
The witness further said management and service Department has not Approved new appointments of the  Applicants. The 
Witness further said that  there around 10 oﬃ  cers in JLM Category who does not fall into Executive grade are serving in the 
Mahapola  Training Institute . They have now absorbed to the executive category subject to their experience 
It has been 9 years since the Applicants joining  period of 5 years to move from  SG category to JLM category.It has been 9 
years since the Applicants joining in 2013. The Witness further said the 
Applicants are still in the same position thet held when they joined in.
The witness further  said after cancelling the Appointment on 24.07.2018, again on 28.02.2020 they were placed on JLM.
But they were not paid the the salaries for the post as per the Circular 3/2018. The payment  of salaries were prohibited  for 
the employees who were not in the approved carder.
Dilrukshi Narmada Pannipitiya, Senior Manager Finance in her evidence started as follows.
The witness said all 7  Applicants remain in the Post of SG3 for a period 10 years without  promotion.
After Analyzing  the evidence of the Applicants, arrived at following conclusion.
The Applicants who are attached to the  Mahapola Ports Maritime Acadamy were placed on Executive  Grade (iv) JLM with 
eﬀ ect from 20.03.2018.
The Applicants  humbled thenselves not to take salary increments for the period 2013 to 2018 once promotion was granted.
The Applicants were reversed  again to non executive grade from 27.07.2018 due to Management Service Department not 
approving their Appointment.
The Applicants were kept in a same Position for a period of 9 years after joining in 2013.
The Applicants are doing a yeoman service as Training Oﬃ  cers in the Mahapola Institute teaching students who will eventually 
become oﬃ  cers.
 After taking into totality of evidence, I have come to followi ng conclusion.
  (a) The Respondent has acted unfairly and maliciously towards  the Applicants denying them promotion to Executive 
Grade.
  (b) The Respondent has acted maliciously and shamlessly and irresponsible manner twice promoting the Applicants 
and again reversing them to previous position due to bureaucratic bungling.
In the circumstances, I wish to quote majority decision of the Supreme Court  in State Bank in India vs. Edirisinghe (1991) 
that the arbitrator has to make an award which is just and equi table, he is not tied down and fettered by the terms of the 
contract of employment. He can create new rights and introduce new obligations between the parties. The eﬀ ect of the award 
is to introduce terms which become implied terms of the contrac t. It was pointed out that as industrial arbitrator  creates a 
new contract for  the future in contrast  to a judge who enforc es rights and liabilities arising out an existing  contracts. A n 
industrial arbitrator settles disputes by dictating new conditi ons of employment to come in to force in the future when he 
cannot get the parties to agree to them in contrast  to a judge who  determines the existing right and liabilities of the parties.
For the reasons aforesaid it is my ﬁ nding that the Respondent, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (party of the second part) has caused 
injustice to the 7 Applicants, (party of the First part) Namely;
 01.  D.W.K. Dippita
 02.  N.P.R.S.Ranasinghe
 03.  T.P.A.J.Fernando
 04.  B.R.D. Perera
 05. K.V .de Mel
 06. G.D.R. Shiranthi
 07. L.P. Kumarasiri
In the circumstances taking into consideration the totality of evidence led before me I make award that the party of the First  
part (All 7 Applicants)
1). D.W.K. Dippita be paid:
