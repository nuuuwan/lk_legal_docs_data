Amendments to SLFRS 3 Business Combinations 
 
P a r a g r a p h  1 1  i s  a m e n d e d  a n d  t h e  f o o t n o t e  t o  Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements  in paragraph 11 is deleted. Paragraphs 14, 21, 22 and 
23 are amended and paragraphs 21A, 21B, 21C, 23A and 64Q are added. A heading is added 
above paragraph 21A and the headings below paragraph 21 and abo ve paragraph 22 are 
amended. New text is underlined  and deleted text is struck thro ugh. Paragraph 10 is 
unamended but is included for ease of reference. 
 
The acquisition method 
 
... 
Recognising and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
Recognition principle 
10 As of the acquisition date, the acquirer shall recognise, separately from goodwill, the identifiable 
assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controllin g interest in the acquiree. 
Recognition of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities ass umed is subject to the conditions 
specified in paragraphs 11 and 12. 
Recognition conditions 
11 To qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisiti on method, the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and  liabilities in the Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements * Conceptual Framew ork for Financial 
Reporting at the acquisition date. For example, costs the acquirer expec ts but is not obliged to incur in 
the future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of or relocate 
an acquiree‚Äôs employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date. Therefore, the acquirer does not 
recognise those costs as part of applying the acquisition metho d. Instead, the acquirer recognises those 
costs in its post-combination financial statements in accordance with other SLFRSs.  
* For this Standard, acquirers are required to apply the defini tions of an asset and a liability and supporting 
guidance in the IASC‚Äôs Framework for the Preparation and Pr esentation of Financial Statements  
adopted by the council of CA Sri Lanka  in 2001 rather than the  Conceptual Framework for Financial 
Reporting issued in 2018. 
 ... 
14 Paragraphs B31 ‚ÄìB40 provide guidance on recognis ing intangible assets. Paragrap hs 2221A ‚Äì28B 
specify the types of identifiable assets and liabilities that i nclude items for which this SLFRS provides 
limited exceptions to the recognition principle and conditions.

Exceptions to the recognition or measurement principles 
21 This SLFRS provides limited exceptions to its recognition an d measurement principles. Paragraphs 
2221A‚Äì31A specify both the particular items for which exceptions are provided and the nature of those 
exceptions. The acquirer shall account for those items by apply ing the requirements in paragraphs 
2221A‚Äì31A, which will result in some items being: 
(a) recognised either by applying recognition conditions in add ition to those in paragraphs 11 and 
12 or by applying the requirements of other SLFRSs, with result s that differ from applying the 
recognition principle and conditions. 
 
(b) measured at an amount other than their acquisition Ãªdate fair values. 
Exception Exceptions to the recognition principle 
Liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of LKAS 37 or IFRIC 21 
21A Paragraph 21B applies to liabilities and contingent liabili ties that would be within the scope of LKAS 
37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or IFRIC 21 Levies if they were incurred 
separately rather than assumed in a business combination. 
21B The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting  defines a liability as ‚Äòa present obligation of the 
entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events‚Äô. For a provision or contingent liability 
that would be within the scope of LKAS 37, the acquirer shall a pply paragraphs 15‚Äì22 of LKAS 37 to 
determine whether at the acquisition date a present obligation exists as a result of past events. For a levy 
that would be within the scope of IFRIC 21, the acquirer shall apply IFRIC 21 to determine whether the 
obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay the levy has occurred by the acquisition date. 
21C A present obligation identified in accordance with paragrap h 21B might meet the definition of a 
contingent liability set out in paragraph 22(b). If so, paragraph 23 applies to that contingent liability. 
 
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets 
22 LKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets defines a contingent liability as:   
(a) a possible obligation that aris es from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain futur e events not wholly within the 
control of the entity; or 
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is no t recognised because:   
(i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying e conomic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation; or 
(ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with suffi cient reliability. 
23 The requirements in LKAS 37 do not apply in determining whic h contingent liabilities to recognise as 
of the acquisition date. Instead, the The acquirer shall recogn ise as of the acquisition date a contingent 
liability assumed in a business combination if it is a present obligation that arises from past events and 
its fair value can be measured reliably. Therefore, contrary to  paragraphs 14(b), 23, 27, 29 and 30 of 
LKAS 37, the acquirer recognises a contingent liability assumed  in a business combination at the 
acquisition date even if it is not  probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits

will be required to settle the obligation. Paragraph 56 of this  SLFRS provides guidance on the 
subsequent accounting for contingent liabilities.
23A LKAS 37 defines a contingentasset as ‚Äòa possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity‚Äô. The acquirer shall no t recognise a contingent asset at the 
acquisition date.

64Q Reference to the Conceptual Framework, issued in May 2020, amended paragraphs 11, 14, 21, 22 and 
23 and added paragraphs 21A, 21B, 21C and 23A. An entity shall apply those amendments to business 
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is permitted if at the same time or earlier 
an entity also applies all the amendments made by Amendments to References to the Conceptual 
Framework in SLFRS Standards, issued in March 2018.
