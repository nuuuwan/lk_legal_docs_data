“building setback” means the minimum distance (in plan) by which a building shall be offset from the plot line, 
except for any permitted intrusions or structures (figure 1.10);
            Explanation: “zero metre setback”:
Zero metre setback is mandatory in certain areas to help generate activities along certain corridors 
or nodes.  The objective is to integrate commercial developments with pedestrian access within the 
road Right of Way (ROW). It can allow for a variety of building typologies and arcade (covered 
walkway) developments (figure 1.11). for Colombo Port City development Project, zero setback 
defines minimum 70% built-to-edge along the East Boulevard in Financial District, and minimum 
50% built-to-edge along other Boulevards (Figure 1.12). The remaining facade can have setbacks for 
plaza and f&B areas. developments built-to-edge can allow for setback at the ground floor for arcade 
(covered walkway) developments;

Urban Design Control Plans (Regulations 63 to 72 both inclusive)
Building Setback
63.  The building setbacks on each side of the plot are defined in the building setback control plan (Figure 
3.2). Setback area in some key plots is mandated to allow for public thoroughfare, helping create more pedestrian 
links through large plots. These public thoroughfares are indicated in the next at-grade pedestrian network plan. The 
basement setbacks are defined in the Land Use Regulations (Regulations 50 to 62). 
Active Edges
 64. Streets are designed to increase the safety and vibrancy of the place. Active edges help define the public 
space and the private space, and create visual connection between the street users and the people inside the buildings. 
By regulating the uses and activities on the ground floor, these streets will have users continuously resulting in active 
public realm. Selected plots are to provide commercial facade along ground level (cannot have their backs or blank 
sides on this side) especially along the Boulevard, the pedestrian mall, public parks, waterfront open space and the 
marina (figure 3.3).
At-Grade Pedestrian Network
65. (1) The overall at-grade pedestrian network consists of the pedestrian malls as the spine of the whole 
network, covered walkways (arcade) that provide all-weather protected pedestrian routes, through-block links 
that break down the scale and improve permeability of the blocks, public thoroughfares that allow part of the 
development to be open for public, and public plazas at important pedestrian nodes (figure 3.4). 
(2)  Covered walkways (arcade) shall be minimum 3.6m wide with 3.0m clear width and 4.5m clear height.
Tower Zone
66.  Tower zone shall be applicable to key plots including mixed use and commercial plots in the financial 
district, TOd parcels and plots in other districts where tower building will be strategically positioned. Tower zone 
suggests the location of tower building, landmark tower, iconic building and TOD marker building to help define the 
skyline of the Colombo Port City (figure 3.5).

Overhead and Underground Pedestrian Links
67. (1) Overhead and underground pedestrian network (figure 3.6) shall compliment to the at-grade pedestrian 
network. These additional connections help navigate through the blocks quickly and conveniently. for plots located 
next to LrT stations, the developments shall connect directly to the LrT concourse through an overhead pedestrian 
link. 
       (2) in the case of financial district, an alternative pedestrian network is proposed at basement level (figure 
3.7). an underground pedestrian network connects all key plots within the financial district. The developer is 
recommended to rent the space along the pedestrian link for commercial activities. These activities will advocate 
business, safety and direct connection between developments. The developer shall provide Sunken Plazas to integrate 
the underground pedestrian network with the at grade pedestrian network.
Vehicle Ingress/Egress 
68.  The vehicular access to plots is usually not taken from the Main Boulevards (figure 3.8). The main 
elevation towards the Boulevard and public parks is mainly dedicated to pedestrian access.  The location of access 
points is to be determined by the developers and the control is indicated by a range where access points can be located. 
However, this is further subject to verification for conflict with utility services, street facilities such as bus stops, taxi 
bays and street lamps, and street furniture such as benches.
Basement Car Park Circulation
69. (1) for plots located in financial district, the developer shall provide basement car park circulation where 
basement car park spaces in these plots can be accessed from (figure 3.9). 
         (2)    Pedestrian walkways shall be provided as they are indicated in the Basement Car Park Circulation Plan 
(figure 3.9). The pedestrian walkways shall be connected to the underground pedestrian network.
         (3) Width of driveway and pedestrian walkways, length of additional left-turn short lane, location of access to 
parking area are indicated on Basement Car Park Circulation Plan.
Roofscape 
70. (1) The roof areas of the development shall be considered the “fifth” elevation and designed to be fully 
integrated as part of the overall building form, massing and architectural treatment and articulated to contribute to 
the skyline profile of this part of the city.
          (2) all service areas, Mechanical and electrical (M&e) equipment, water tanks, roof-top equipment, etc., shall 
be fully located within and integrated into the overall building envelope and visually concealed from the top and 
on all sides.

(a) Green Buffer Zones: 
The planted green buffer to the frontage of the plot facing a road, from which there is vehicular access to 
the site, shall be a minimum of 3.0m.
(b) Perimeter Tree Planting:
Boundary tree planting (minimum width 2.0m) in a building setback fronting and contiguous with 
the public realm shall be sufficient to clearly demarcate the plot boundary and allow unobstructed 
pedestrian access into the ground level arcades and access to the building.
(c) Public Thoroughfare:
Public thoroughfare access is to be provided within the plot boundary. as the plot boundary will lie 
within an integrated public open space it shall be demarcated with a non-corrosive metal strip or similar 
and provided with clearly marked and referenced trig points for land survey confirmation of the plot 
boundary with the land registration records.
(d) Public Spaces:
Public spaces with minimum area of 1,000m² each in the form of plazas are to be provided within the 
development. Public space provided shall have its frontage opened and un-obstructed to allow for easy 
pedestrian access and good visibility from the adjoining street / public open space.
Night Lighting Master Plan
72. (1) The Night Lighting Master Plan for the financial district, along the Canal and Marina district, shall 
guide the lighting up of developments to achieve a unique, three-dimensional nightscape for the area (figure 3.11). 
This Master Plan is realised incrementally as and when new buildings are developed and when existing buildings 
redevelop or undergo major refurbishment.
(2) all developments within the Master Plan boundary are required to provide night lighting in 
compliance with the requirements listed in this section. These are to help realise the vision for a congruous, 
harmonious and well-coordinated signature nightscape, for the day-to-day night lighting of buildings as well as 
during festivals and national events. The Guidelines provide a recommended framework for the lighting treatment 
of key building elements, including the covered walkways, building facades, sky gardens and building crowns. They 
also highlight practical issues, such as light trespass, light pollution, light fitting details, as well as energy efficiency 
and maintenance, which should be considered upfront at the design stage.
(3) The night lighting design should take cognizance of the lighting design of surrounding developments.
(4) The night lighting design under the Master Plan refers to the lighting up of the exterior of the building 
to highlight the design of the development, particularly the building crown, façade, main architectural features of 
the building, sky gardens and the pedestrian areas at street level, using permanent lighting fixtures.

(5) The light fixtures are encouraged to be designed and well-integrated with the overall design of the 
building and integrated into the building façade or within a building element, such as the roof feature or sun-shading 
devices. The entire lighting fixture shall be located and installed fully within the boundary of the development.
(6)   The night lighting design will be evaluated under the following categories: -
(a) Basic Night Lighting - defined as the daily elegant, tasteful and sensitive lighting up of the 
architecture of the building to complement the overall skyline of the City at night; and
(b) Special Night Lighting - defined as special night lighting to accompany a specific festival or 
event. Special Night Lighting installations are fittings which can be programmed to complement 
and contribute to different festivals or events held in the area.
(7) as a guide, the daily night lighting shall be elegant, tasteful and sensitive to the architecture of the 
building and well-coordinated with the overall night time skyline. animated night lighting sequences for daily 
lighting up of the building are discouraged.  festival or event night lighting shall relate to and complement the 
theme of the festival or event. a separate detailed festival night lighting proposal shall be submitted for each event 
for evaluation and approval of the Estate Manager. Specific guidelines may be provided by the Estate Manager or 
the appointed event organiser to ensure coordination of the festive night lighting of developments around the area.
(8) Building owners are required to minimally turn on the night lighting as per the guideline issued by the 
Commission.
(9)  The night lighting design shall be sustainable and energy saving.
(10) all developments within the financial district, along the canal and the Marina district (figure 3.11), 
are required to provide night lighting under the Night Lighting Master Plan, in accordance with the prevailing 
guidelines.
(11) To ensure that the external building lighting installation is considered as an integral part of the design of 
the development, all night lighting proposals shall be submitted formally to the Commission for approval as part of 
the development Permit process.
(12) The Night Lighting design shall minimally focus on the-
(a)   Covered Walkways and Public Spaces at the ground floor;
(b)   façades of the buildings visible from the surrounding roads and public spaces;
(c)   Sky Gardens; and
(d)   Building Crown.
(13) The external night lighting shall be reflected in the proposal plans for the development for the Commission’s 
approval. a retention clause will be included as a condition in the development permit for the development to ensure 
that the night lighting is retained and operated.
(14) any changes to the approved night lighting proposal for the development (e.g. change in lighting 
concept, type of lighting equipment, specifications of the lighting equipment), are required to be submitted to the 
Commission for evaluation and approval.
(15) If the external lighting fixtures are not installed and commissioned according to the approved plans, 
the applicant or building owner will be required to revise the lighting installation to match the previously approved 
lighting design or provide reasons for the deviation for the Commission evaluation and approval.

(16) The night lighting fixtures are to be retained and maintained throughout the entire life of the building and 
shall not be removed without the prior approval of the estate Manager.
(17)   Night lighting of the building crowns help to create a unique, three- dimensional skyline   for the 
city. a strategic colour temperature plan recommends that low and mid-rise structures use lights of a lower colour 
temperature at their building crowns, while high-rise structures should use higher colour temperature lights, to create 
a colour gradation effect for the skyline
(18) There is a growing concern about the excessive use of lights to illuminate the cityscape. Night lighting 
shall thus be executed sensitively to avoid glare, light trespass and light pollution. Pedestrians, residents, drivers, and 
other fields of vision shall be considered to prevent light spillage and to increase the energy efficiency of the lighting.
(19) Sufficient measures shall be taken to ensure that night lighting fixtures and mounting details are fully 
integrated with the architecture and/or landscape design of the building and screened from view.
(20) The night lighting equipment shall have necessary protective means from damage, theft and harm to the 
public, for those elements that are accessible to the public.
(21)  Light sources that have a high energy-efficiency rating, have a long operating life for easier maintenance, 
and are of high economic efficiency, such as compact metal halide lamps, fluorescent lamps, LEDs, or electrodeless 
lamps, are recommended for use.

for parallel parking, where cars cannot be parked by reversing or where there are obstructions at its ends, minimum stall 
length shall be 7.2m (figure a-3).
Dead-end aisles shall be avoided wherever possible, as manoeuvring and parking at those corner-ends would be difficult for 
drivers. instead, the end space shall be widened to 2.8m to facilitate parking (fig. a-4).
2.2 Car Park Allocation
For the following land uses, a minimum of 80% of vehicle parking spaces shall be in multi-storey and/or basement car parks:
•	 Low rise residential (r1), Medium rise residential (r2), Mixed use 1, Mixed use 2 (TOd Parcel), Mixed use 
3 (CBd Parcel), Commercial, Marina Commercial, Hotel, education, Public facility, Marina facility.
For the following land uses, a minimum of 50% of vehicle parking spaces shall be in multi-storey and/or basement car parks:
•	 Cultural and Healthcare, Leisure and entertainment.
2.3 Minimum Width of Parking Aisle
a parking aisle refers to an access lane or driveway with adjacent parking stalls.
Parking angle is the angle measured between the longer side of the parking stall and the line of traffic flow of the aisle.
Traffic Flow refers to the direction of vehicle movement.
