notice.
 26.5 After holding such inquiry the Employer shall notify the Employee of the findings of each of the charges in the 
show cause notice and the punishment, if any, imposed by the Employer. Provided that if the  Employer fails to

authorities for investigation or inquiries that the outcome of such investigations or inquiries be awaited,

own seeking within thirty (30) working days from the date of the Employee’s suspension, the Employee shall 
be entitled to half his normal remuneration for the period of thirty (30) days from the date of such suspension 
and to his full remuneration for the period of suspension in excess of thirty (30) days up to the date on which 
the Employer makes an order under paragraphs 26.6.1 to 26.6.3 of the preceding Sub - clause, irrespective of 
the outcome of the inquiry.

period of ninety (90) days be extended for such further time as may be agreed.
 26.9 An Employer shall not be required to hold an inquiry as referrd to in Sub - clauses 26.4 and 26.5 hereof where

requests the holding of an inquiry the Employer shall comply with such request and the provisions relating to the 
holding of an inquiry shall then apply subject to the exception that the fact that the inquiry had not commenced 
within ten (10) working days after receipt of the Employee’s explanation shall not be material or relevant.

subscriptions  is not in arrears the employer will recognize that Union for the purpose of general claims and

or matter is restricted to one type of business or one work place but is applicable or capable of being applicable 
to other workers in the service of the Employer, the competence of the Union to make such claim or raise such 
matter shall be determined by  reference to the duly qualified members of such Union in proportion to the total 
number of workers in the categories covered by this Agreement.
 29.3 If it becomes necessary to decide the question whether at the establishment of the Employer, the Union is 
competent to make general claims or raise general matters the same shall be determined by a referendum 
which shall be held by the Department of Labour and the result of such referendum shall be binding on the 
parties hereto.
 30. Dispute Procedure.– 
 30.1  In the case of a dispute unrelated to current work arrangements and which is not matter covered by the 
Collective  Agreement, the Union shall submit the dispute on behalf of its members to the Employer and give 
the Employer at least ten (10) days time within which to reply. If in the Union's opinion the Employer's reply 
is unsatisfactory, the Union and the Employer shall enter into discussions with a view to reaching a settlement.

controlling body (by whatsoever name called) of the Union is  mala fide or vindictive or calculated to threaten or undermine
