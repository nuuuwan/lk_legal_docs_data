 (a) This payment will be equal to the total sales value achiev ed against planned sales value of the Company.
 (b) The salary for the calculation of the bonus shall be the s alary drawn by the respective employee in the last month 
of Financial Year in respect of which bonus is payable. 
 (c) An employee who is absent in excess of his leave entitleme nt for a period of six (06) or more days will not be 
eligible to receive this bonus and it shall not be paid to such employee
 (d) Subject to the number of days absent in excess of an emplo yee's leave entitlement in any one year the employer 
shall be entitled to make deductions from the bonus payable to an employee in the under - noted manner.
 
No of Days Eligible Bonus %
1 day in excess of leave entitlement 5% of declared bouns
2 days in excess of leave entitlement 12 ½% of declared bouns

of the relevant machine, the calculation is done based on the agreement of both parties.
For this Dye House department the incentives will be calculated by two diﬀ erent calculation methods as Dye House Machine 
Operators Calculation method and Dye House Supporting Services

 A. Dyeing Output Target
  Productivity Scheme - The target starting point is 90% of the  SSP Equivalent Lots including Kier wash for 
individual production cell as stated below followed by incremental 1% percentage increase ﬁ nally up to 110%.
