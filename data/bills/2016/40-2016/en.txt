by regulations adopted by the Board of Governors. A majority vote
of the arbitrators shall be sufficient to reach a decision which shall be

(Ratification)
regional members (Regional Directors) and a Minimum Percentage
for constituency voting power for Directors to be elected by
Governors representing non-regional members (Non-Regional
Directors):
(a) The Minimum Percentage for Regional Directors shall be
set as a percentage of the total votes eligible to be cast in
the election by the Governors representing regional
members (Regional Governors). The initial Minimum
Percentage for Regional Directors shall be 6%.
(b) The Minimum Percentage for Non-Regional Directors
shall be set as a percentage of the total votes eligible to be
cast in the election by the Governors representing non-
regional members (Non-Regional Governors). The initial
Minimum Percentage for Non-Regional Directors shall
be 15%.
3. Adjustment Percentage. In order to adjust voting power across
constituencies when subsequent rounds of balloting are required
under paragraph 7 below, the Board of Governors shall establish,
for each election, an Adjustment Percentage for Regional Directors
and an Adjustment Percentage for Non-Regional Directors. Each
Adjustment Percentage shall be higher than the corresponding
Minimum Percentage:
(a) The Adjustment Percentage for Regional Directors shall
be set as a percentage of the total votes eligible to be cast in
the election by the Regional Governors. The initial
Adjustment Percentage for Regional Directors shall be
15%.
(b) The Adjustment Percentage for Non-Regional Directors
shall be set as a percentage of the total votes eligible to be
cast in the election by the Non-Regional Governors. The
initial Adjustment Percentage for Non-Regional Directors
shall be 60%.
4. Number of Candidates. For each election, the Board of
Governors shall establish the number of Regional Directors and

(b) The initial number of Non-Regional Directors shall be

5. Nominations. Each Governor may only nominate one person.
Candidates for the office of Regional Director shall be nominated by

6. Voting. Each Governor may vote for one candidate, casting all
of the votes to which the member appointing him is entitled under
paragraph 1 of Article 28. The election of Regional Directors shall
be by ballot of Regional Governors. The election of Non-Regional
Directors shall be by ballot of Non-Regional Governors.
7. First Ballot. On the first ballot, candidates receiving the highest
number of votes, up to the number of Directors to be elected, shall be
elected as Directors, provided that, to be elected, a candidate shall
have received a sufficient number of votes to reach the applicable
Minimum Percentage:
(a) If the required number of Directors is not elected on the
first ballot, and the number of candidates was the same as
the number of Directors to be elected, the Board of
Governors shall determine the subsequent actions to
complete the election of Regional Directors or the election
of Non-Regional Directors, as the case may be.
8. Subsequent Ballots. If the required number of Directors is not
elected on the first ballot, and there were more candidates than the
number of Directors to be elected on the ballot, there shall be
subsequent ballots, as necessary. For subsequent ballots:
(a) The candidate receiving the lowest number of votes in the
preceding ballot shall not be a candidate in the next ballot.
(b) Votes shall be cast only by:
(i) Governors who voted in the preceding ballot for a
candidate who was not elected; and
(ii) Governors whose votes for a candidate who was
elected are deemed to have raised the votes for that
candidate above the applicable Adjustment
Percentage under (c) below.

<!-- page 45 -->

44 Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Agreemeet
(Ratification)
(c) The votes of all the Governors who cast votes for each
candidate shall be added in descending order of number,
until the number of votes representing the applicable
Adjustment Percentage has been exceeded. Governors
whose votes were counted in that calculation shall be
deemed to have cast all their votes for that Director,
including the Governor whose votes brought the total over
theAdjustment Percentage. The remaining Governors
whose votes were not counted in that calculation shall be
deemed to have raised the candidate’s total votes above
the Adjustment Percentage, and the votes of those
Governors shall not count towards the election of that
candidate. These remaining Governors may vote in the
next ballot;
(d) If in any subsequent ballot, only one Director remains to
be elected, the Director may be elected by a simple majority
of the remaining votes. All such remaining votes shall be
deemed to have counted towards the election of the last
Director.
9. Assignment of Votes. Any Governor who does not participate
in voting for the election or whose votes do not contribute to the
election of a Director may assign the votes to which he is entitled to
an elected Director, provided that such Governor shall first have
obtained the agreement of all those Governors who have elected that
Director to such assignment.
10. Founding Member Privileges. The nomination and voting by
Governors for Directors and the appointment of Alternate Directors
by Directors shall respect the principle that each Founding Member
shall have the privilege to designate the Director or an Alternate
Director in its constituency permanently or on a rotating basis.
