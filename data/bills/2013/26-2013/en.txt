AN  ACT TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST
REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
Whereas the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was
purportedly enacted, consequent to the Indo - Sri Lanka
Accord being entered into between the President of Sri Lanka
and the Prime Minister of India in 1987 under duress in
defiance of the sovereignity of the people of Sri Lanka and;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka did not approve the provisions of the
13th amendment Bill as being consistent with the
Constitution in as much as only four judges of the Supreme
Court out of nine held that the approval of the people at a
referendum was not required to enact the 13th Amendment
whilst five judges held that at least one or more of the
provisions of the Bill was in violation of the Constitution
and therefore required the approval of the people at a
referendum and ;
Whereas in terms of Article 80(2) of the Constitution ‘’where
the Supreme Court has determined that a Bill or any provision
thereof requires the approval of the people at a referendum”
such bill or such provision shall become law only upon the
same being approved by the people at a referendum and the
President certifies that the Bill or any Provision thereof has
been so approved in the manner as set out in the said Article;
Whereas the majority of the judges that constituted the bench
of the Supreme Court had determined that the Bill or any
one or more of the provisions thereof requires the approval
of the people at a referendum, such Bill can become law
only if complied with Article 80(2) upon being approved by
the people at a referendum and therefore the purported
certificate of the Speaker endorsed on the Bill purportedly
under Articles 79 and 80(1) of the Constitution is invalid
and unconstitutional and ;

Whereas the Supreme Court has determined that any Bill or
any Provision thereof requires the approval at a referendum
the only cause of action available under the law is to comply
with the process set out in Article 80(2) and the purported
Amendment made to Article 154G(2)( b) and 154G(3)(b) of
the 13th Amendment Bill in Parliament without a further
determination by the Supreme Court is unconstitutional and
unlawful and ;
Whereas the 13th Amendment in Article 154A (3)
provides for the establishment of one administrative unit for
two or more Provinces, to accommodate the unlawful
undertaking given by the then President of Sri Lanka in the
Indo-Sri Lanka accord to establish one administrative unit
for the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka on the
erroneous and false basis that the Northern and Eastern
Provinces form part of the homeland of one single ethnic
and/or linguistic community as claimed by the separatist
forces and ;
Whereas the 13th Amendment has sought to abdicate the
legislative power vested in Parliament and the Executive
power vested in the President by the division of
governmental power and restricted the Parliament and the
President respectively exercising the legislative and
executive power of the poeple and thereby offended the
unitary character of the State ;
Whereas the 13th Amemdment has vested inter alia police
powers (including powers in relation to maintenance of public
order) in Provincial Councils which was hitherto exercised
by the Government of Sri Lanka, which will be a serious
threat to national security concerns of the Republic in as
much as ;
(a) the 13th Amendment provides for the Chief Minister
of a Province to directly control the Head of the
Provincial Police Force and thereby all Police
Officers of the said Force and even national police

units operating in any province. (vide Item 11 of
the Appendix of List 1 of the 9th Schedule) thereby
effectively taking away the powers of the Inspector
General of Police and the Government of Sri Lanka
exercising any authority over such police force.
(b) the 13th Amendment entrusts the responsibilty of
prevention detection, investigation of all offences
(except the offences specified in the Schedule
therein) and institution of prosecutions (subject to
the powers of the Attorney General) to Provincial
Councils and to enact any law on any such matter
and further empower any Provincial Council to
prevent any Police Officers of another Province
entering such Province (vide the limitations
contained in sub paragraph ( k) of the 2nd item of
list II of the 9th Schedule) and thereby jeopardizing
the management of law and order and the national
security of the Republic.
(c) the 13th Amendment even restricts police officers
of the national police force from being in uniform
compelling them to be in plain clothes even when
performing the limited responsibilities allowed
within a province such as when engaging in
prevention detection and investigation of a
scheduled offence (vide item 11.1 read with 12.1 of
the relevant Appendix of the 9th Schedule).
Whereas the 13th Amendment, though based on the
Constitutional structure of India, denies the Government of
Sri Lanka to intervene in the event of a Province acting
against the interests of the Repubic, although the Central
government of India is empowered to intervene in similar
situations. (Vide Article 256 and 257 of the Constitution of
India.)

Whereas the power of the Government of Sri Lanka to give
directions with regard to the manner of exercising executive
power by a Province is restricted to a situation where the
maintenance of essential supplies and services is threatened
or that the security of Sri Lanka is threatened by war or external
aggression or armed rebelion (vide Article154j and 154k) no
such limitation is placed under the Constitution on the
Government of India and ;
Whereas the 13th Amendment seeks to weaken the
Government of Sri Lanka whilst strengthening the Provincial
Councils and threrby destroying the unitary character of the
State, territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and the sovereignity
of its people and ;
Whereas Sri Lanka is a Free, sovereign, independent and
unitary State and it is the duty of the State to safeguard the
independence, sovereignty, unity and the territorial integrity
of Sri Lanka and the provision of the 13th Amendment are a
threat to the independence, sovereignity, unity and the
territorial integrity of Sri Lanka ;
BE it enacted by the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka as follows :—
1. This Act may be cited as the twenty first Amendment
to the Constitution.
2. The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as the
“Constitution”) is hereby amended by the repeal of;—
(a) Article 154 A to 154 T which constitute  Chapter
XVIIA
