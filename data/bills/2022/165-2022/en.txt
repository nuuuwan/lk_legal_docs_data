and Services Tax in default and the name and address of the

(b) cash in a designated foreign currency, such cash
shall be deposited in any licensed commercial bank
and the proceeds there from applied in the payment
of the costs and charges of seizing and any balance
shall be  applied in satisfaction of the Special  Goods
and Services Tax in default; and
(c) movable property other than cash, such property
shall be kept for seven days as costs and charges of
the defaulter. If the defaulter does not pay the
Special Goods and Services Tax in default together
with the associated costs and charges within the
said seven days, the District Secretary shall cause
such property to be sold by public auction, or where
such property is a negotiable instrument or a share
in any corporation or public company, to be sold
through a broker at the market rate of the day.
(4) The sum realized by a sale referred to in paragraph (c)
of subsection (3), shall be applied–
(a) firstly, in payment of the costs and charges of
seizing,  keeping and selling the property; and
(b) secondly, in satisfaction of the Special Goods and
Services Tax  in default, and any balance shall be
paid to the owner of the property so seized.
(5) It shall be lawful for the District Secretary to recover

30

<!-- page 16 -->

Special Goods and Services Tax 15
the recovery by the means provided in subsection (1) is
impracticable or inexpedient, he may issue a certificate to a
District Court having jurisdiction in any district where the
defaulter resides or in which any property, movable or
immovable, owned by the defaulter is situated, containing
particulars of  the Special Goods and Services Tax in default,
and the name and address of the defaulter  by whom the
Special Goods and Services Tax  is payable, and the courts
shall thereupon direct a writ of execution to issue to the
Fiscal, authorizing and requiring him to seize and sell all or
any of the property, movable or immovable, of the defaulter,
or such part thereof as he may deem necessary for the recovery
of the Special Goods and Services Tax in default, and the
provisions of sections 226 to 297 of the Civil Procedure
Code (Chapter 101) shall, mutatis mutandis , apply to such
seizure and sale.
(8) Whenever the Commissioner-General of Inland
Revenue issues a Certificate under this section, he shall at
the same time issue to the defaulter whether resident or non-
resident, a notification thereof by registered post. The non-
receipt of such notification by the defaulter shall not
invalidate proceedings under this section.
13. (1) ( a) Where the Commissioner-General of Inland
Revenue is of the opinion in any case that recovery of the
Special Goods and Services Tax in default by seizure and
sale is impracticable or inexpedient, or where the full amount
of the Special Goods and Services Tax  in default has not
been collected, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue
may issue a certificate containing particulars of the amount
of the Special Goods and Services Tax  in default and the
name and last known place of business or residence of the
defaulter to a Magistrate having jurisdiction over the
division in which the defaulter resides or is carrying out the
business.

requiring him to appear before him on a date to be specified
to show cause, as to why further proceedings for the recovery
of the Tax in default should not be justified against such
defaulter and if sufficient cause is not shown, the Special
Goods and Services Tax in default shall be deemed to be a
fine imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter
for an offence punishable with fine only or not punishable
with imprisonment, and the provisions of subsection (1) of
section 291 (except paragraphs (a), (d) and (i) thereof) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, relating to

direction which, by the provisions of that subsection, he
could have made at the time of imposing such sentence.
(2) Nothing in subsections (2) to (5) of section 291 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 shall apply
in any case referred to in subsection (1).

defaulter is sentenced to imprisonment in default of payment
of the fine deemed by that subsection to have been imposed
on the defaulter  the Magistrate may allow time not
exceeding twelve months, for the payment of the amount of
the said fine or direct payment of that amount to be made by
instalments.
(4) The Court may be required bail to be given as a
condition precedent for allowing time under subsection (1)
for showing cause as therein provided or under subsection
(3) for the payment of the fine; and the provisions of Chapter
XXXIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of
1979, shall apply where the defaulter is so required to be
given bail.
(5) Where payment in installments is directed under
subsection (3) and default is made in the payment of any
one installment, the same proceedings may be taken as if
default had been made in payment of all the installments
then remaining unpaid.
