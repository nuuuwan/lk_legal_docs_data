to learn, develop and grow to become a better and more
prosperous society: and
WHEREAS of this Act to afford to all persons under the age
of eighteen all possible protection of the law and to ensure
that no person shall consent or decide on their behalf to enter
them into a marriage and to introduce measures for the relevant
organs of the State give full effect to the spirit and letter of
this Act and thereby convey that the State is committed to
